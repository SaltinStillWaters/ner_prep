{"text": "Hi.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this video, we're going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> looks like this, and the formula is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's go right in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is the probability that <EXPRESSION> is less than or = little <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's look at some cases here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if little <EXPRESSION> is less than <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> random variable only takes on these non-negative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the probability that <EXPRESSION> is less than or = some negative number is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, if <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>, we do actually have to integrate here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to do that, we take the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> the dummy variable here used is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7698, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 7699, "label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And now we plug in for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And recall that the integral of <EXPRESSION> to the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here in this case, we'll get <EXPRESSION>, which is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then a here is going to be negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get this, <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> cancel and we actually get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7717, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we are done with the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now for the expectation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We use the standard formula, which is <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we do the integral from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But at the end the day, you're going to have to pull out your calculus textbook and find the integration by parts formula, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the hope is that this integral is going to be easier than the <EXPRESSION> on the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice that this is the integral of <EXPRESSION> of the terms here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> of the terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that may help you decide on how you select <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the derivative is what's going to go in that integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, <EXPRESSION> I'm going to select as whatever's left over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is going to be we already did the integral <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if we do this, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is evaluated from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what does it mean for this to be evaluated from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "A better and easier way to look at this is to say, well, it's going to go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then you take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7759, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7760, "label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "So that's going to help us here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this negative these negatives cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 7761, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}, {"id": 7762, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So they're kind of competing for each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the exponential is going to win because it decays way faster than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this <EXPRESSION> term is going to go off the limit is going to go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the expectation is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now what's the variance?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's part c, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we use the standard formula for variance, which is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already figured out the expectation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just need to figure out the expectation of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we're just going to follow the same set of steps from before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be exactly the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's a negative sign out here, so the negatives cancel and we're left with a positive sign here.", "entities": [{"id": 7786, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 54}, {"id": 7787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "This is going to change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to do this integral, we can use a trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We move this <EXPRESSION> in here, leave the <EXPRESSION> inside.", "entities": [{"id": 7797, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "And you have to leave the <EXPRESSION> inside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But multiply by <EXPRESSION> and divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7801, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 7803, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "Now, look at that integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exactly the expectation that we computed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already did that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is just <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> the exponential will beat <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No matter what polynomial we put in there, the exponential's going to win.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION>'s going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7813, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So we're left with <EXPRESSION> for expectation of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we have <EXPRESSION> for the variance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we're done with the variance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Part d.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're given that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are independent and identically distributed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're exponentials with rate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're asked for the <EXPRESSION>, which is the max of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we generally find a <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is going to have the same sort of structure as before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is less than <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> are positive non-negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is the probability that if you get little <EXPRESSION> less than <EXPRESSION>, you're not going to have any probability there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION> is where it gets interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need to do something special.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the special thing here is to recognize that the probability of the max being less than or = <EXPRESSION> is actually also the probability of each of these random variables individually being less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is that true?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, if <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are individually less than or = <EXPRESSION>, then the max is also less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these <EXPRESSION> events are equivalent and this is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By independence we can break this up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we get these are all CDFs of the exponential and they all have this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plug this in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be the same, like this for <EXPRESSION> less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For <EXPRESSION> greater than or = to <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be the derivative of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the PDF we were looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So last problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're looking for the <EXPRESSION>, which is the min of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's try this as a similar approach.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Try the same thing, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See if it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if this works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it true that the <EXPRESSION> if the min of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is less than or = <EXPRESSION>, that each of them is less than or = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> could be less than or = <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> could be bigger than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the min could still be less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's definitely not true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do we do here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "In that case, let's check if we can do this trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are individually bigger than <EXPRESSION>, then clearly the min's also bigger than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can use independence as before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be Notice the similarity between this and this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only difference is this has a <EXPRESSION> in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that <EXPRESSION> is an exponential random variable with rate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then the <EXPRESSION> is going to be an exponential, whatever it is for an exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except with rate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can also take the derivative of this and find that you get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we're done with the problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We computed some interesting quantities for the exponential random variable in this", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are solutions, then <EXPRESSION> is also a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's actually do problems, because I think that will actually help you learn, as opposed to help you get confused.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I have this differential equation, the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7934, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So we need to find a <EXPRESSION> where <EXPRESSION> times its <EXPRESSION> derivative, plus <EXPRESSION> times its <EXPRESSION> derivative, plus <EXPRESSION> times itself, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like, if <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe the constant in front of the function changes as I take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you've listened to a lot of my videos, you'd realize that it probably is what I consider to be the most amazing function in mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in particular, maybe <EXPRESSION> won't work here or you can even try it out, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you did <EXPRESSION>, it won't satisfy this equation, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just make the assumption that <EQUATION>, substitute it back into this, and then see if we can actually solve for an <EXPRESSION> that makes this equation true.", "entities": [{"id": 7963, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 7964, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "And if we can, we've found the solution, or maybe we've found several solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's try it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the <EXPRESSION> derivative of it, <EXPRESSION> of all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>is = what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Derivative of the inside is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then derivative of the outside is still just <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the <EXPRESSION> derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're ready to substitute back in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will switch colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> derivative, that's <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative, so that's <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times our function <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7993, "label": "command", "start_offset": 130, "end_offset": 134}, {"id": 7994, "label": "command", "start_offset": 148, "end_offset": 153}, {"id": 7995, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 76}, {"id": 7996, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "And something might already be surfacing to you as something we can do this equation to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of these terms on the left all have an <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, so let's factor that out.", "entities": [{"id": 7991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 101}, {"id": 7992, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So this = <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And our goal, remember, was to solve for the <EXPRESSION>, or the <EXPRESSION>'s, that will make this true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order for this side of the equation to be <EXPRESSION>, what do we know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can <EXPRESSION> ever = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can you ever get something to some exponent and get <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this cannot = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do that in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know, if we want to solve for <EXPRESSION>, that this, <EXPRESSION>, that has to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is called the characteristic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This, the <EXPRESSION>, is called the characteristic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it should be obvious to you that now this is no longer calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just factoring a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> actually is fairly straightforward to factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the solutions of the characteristic equation or actually, the solutions to this original equation are <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what are those?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> solution we found, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the what is this?", "entities": []}
{"text": " <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now my question to you is, is this the most general solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in the last video, in kind of our introductory video, we learned that a constant times a solution is still a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's multiply it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8125, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That's a <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is also going to be a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now it's a little bit more general, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a whole class of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> doesn't have to just be <EXPRESSION>, it can be any constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you use your initial values, you actually can figure out what that constant is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And same for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> doesn't have to be <EXPRESSION>, it has to be any constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we learned that in the last video, that if something's a solution, some constant times that is also a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we also learned that if we have <EXPRESSION> different solutions, that if you add them together, you also get a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the most general solution to this differential equation is <EXPRESSION> we could say <EXPRESSION>, just to hit it home that this is definitely a function of <EXPRESSION> <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "And this is the general solution of this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I won't prove it because the proof is fairly involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, we just tried out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe there's some other wacko function that would have worked here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll tell you now, and you kind of have to take it as a leap of faith, that this is the only general solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There isn't some crazy outside function there that would have also worked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the other question that might be popping in your brain is, Sal, when we did <EXPRESSION> order differential equations, we only had <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that was OK, because we had <EXPRESSION> set of initial conditions and we solved for our constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But here, I have <EXPRESSION> constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I wanted a particular solution, how can I solve for <EXPRESSION> variables if I'm only given <EXPRESSION> initial condition?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if that's what you actually thought, your intuition would be correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You actually need <EXPRESSION> initial conditions to solve this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would need to know, at a given value of <EXPRESSION>, what <EXPRESSION> =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, maybe at a given value of <EXPRESSION>, what the <EXPRESSION> derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is what we will do in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're through with techniques of integration, which is really the most technical thing that we're going to be doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're just clearing up a few loose ends about calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> we're going to talk about today will allow us to deal with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's what's known as L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we're going to do today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "L'Hopital's Rule it's also known as L'Hospital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same name, since the circumflex is what you put in French to omit the s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the same thing, and it's still pronounced L'Hopital, even if it's got an s in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so that's the <EXPRESSION> thing you need to know about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what this method does is, it's a convenient way to calculate limits including some new ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it'll be convenient for the old ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are going to be some new ones and, as an example, you can calculate <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could, whoops, that's not a very interesting <EXPRESSION>, let's try <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> from the positive side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can calculate, for example, <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, maybe I should include a few others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe something like ln <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are some examples of things which, in fact, if you plug into your calculator, you can see what's happening with these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you want to understand them systematically, it's much better to have this tool of L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And certainly there isn't a proof just based on a calculation in a calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now here's the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll make it systematic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're going to generalize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll make it much more, so when it includes these new limits, there are some little pieces of trickiness that you have to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a limit that we could've handled.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the thing that's interesting, I mean, if you like this is in this category that we mentioned at the beginning of the course of interesting limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's interesting about it is that if you do this silly thing, which is just plug in <EQUATION>, at <EQUATION> you're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8175, "label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "And that's what we call an indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just unclear what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From that plugging, in you just can't get it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, on the other hand, there's a trick for doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the trick that we did at the beginning of the class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the idea is I can divide in the numerator and denominator by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8177, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8178, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 45}, {"id": 8179, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "So this limit is unchanged, if I try to cancel the hidden factor <EXPRESSION> in the numerator and denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8181, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "Now, we can actually carry out these ratios of polynomials and calculate them by long division in algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's very, very long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to do this with calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we already have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already know that this ratio is what's called a difference quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the limit, it tends to the derivative of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the idea is that this is actually =, in the limit, now let's just study <EXPRESSION> piece of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know what the numerator goes to, and similarly we'll know what the denominator goes to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know what the answer is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the numerator it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the denominator, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>, that's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8194, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 36}, {"id": 8195, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And then were going to have to evaluate that at <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "And so it's going to be <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's pretty easy to get from our techniques and knowledge of derivatives, using this rather clever algebraic trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This business of dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I want to do now is just carry this method out systematically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to give us the approach to what's known as L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What my main subject for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose we're considering, in general, a limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to some number a of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And suppose it's the bad case where we can't decide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's in determinate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're just going to do exactly the same thing we did over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, we're going to divide a numerator and denominator, and we're going to repeat that argument.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't changed anything yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to write it in this suggestive form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I'm going to take separately the limit in the numerator and the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why am I allowed to do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I didn't change this numerator of the numerator any by subtracting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do the same thing to the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, <EQUATION>, so this is OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And lo and behold, I know what these limits are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the technique and this evaluates the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's not so difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The formula's pretty straightforward here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it works, provided that <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, is there a more intuitive way of understanding this procedure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think the short answer is that there are other, similar, ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't consider them to be more intuitive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's very important to understand all of these, more or less, at once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I wouldn't claim that any of these methods is a more intuitive <EXPRESSION> than the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But basically what's happening is, we're looking at the linear approximation to <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the linear approximation to <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what underlies this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Version 1.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not going to be quite the same as what we just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be much, much better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And more useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is going to take care of is this problem that the denominator is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now here's what we're going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to say that it turns out that the limit <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8229, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Now, that looks practically the same as what we said before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to make sure that you understand when it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it works provided this is <EXPRESSION> of these undefined expressions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, also, we need <EXPRESSION> more assumption.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the right-hand side, the right-hand limit exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is practically the same thing as what I said over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I took the ratio of these functions, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I took their derivatives, which is what I did right here, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just differentiated them and I took the ratio.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is way easier than the quotient rule, and is nothing like the quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't think quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't think quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we differentiate the numerator and denominator separately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what I'm claiming over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take these functions, I replace them with this ratio of derivatives, and then I take the limit instead, over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it turned out that the functions got much simpler when I differentiated them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I started with this messy object and I got this much easier object that I could easily evaluate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the big game that's happening here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It works, if this limit makes sense and this limit exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what's going to help us a little bit in a few examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me give you a couple of examples and then we'll go further.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> we have to understand how this <EXPRESSION> works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8245, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 8246, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "This is another kind of example of a limit that we discussed in the <EXPRESSION> part of the course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unfortunately, now we're reviewing stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this should reinforce what you did there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will be an easier way of thinking about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So by L'Hopital's Rule, so here's the step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the limit, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of the derivatives here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The limit was <EXPRESSION> over there, but now it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> is the same as the limit of the derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's easy to evaluate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's a multiplication sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should just write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8261, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "Divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8263, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "But you know that that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how L'Hopital's method works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's pretty painless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to give you another example, which shows that it works a little better than the method that I started out with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's what happens if we consider the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was a little harder to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, this is <EXPRESSION> of these <EXPRESSION> things near <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, this goes to an indeterminate form here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, according to our method, this is equivalent to, now I'm going to use this little wiggle because I don't want to write limit, limit, limit, limit a million times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to use a little wiggle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, this is going to behave the same way as differentiating numerator and denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again this is going to be <EXPRESSION> in the numerator.", "entities": [{"id": 8274, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8275, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "In the denominator, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8277, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 8278, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "Now, notice that we still haven't won yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is still of <EXPRESSION> type.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you plug in <EQUATION> you still get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 8283, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "But that doesn't damage the method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That doesn't make the method fail.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION>, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule a <EXPRESSION> time.", "entities": [{"id": 8292, "label": "method", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 48}, {"id": 8293, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "And as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> this is the same thing as, again, differentiating the numerator and denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I get <EXPRESSION> in the numerator, and I get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8299, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 8300, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 43}, {"id": 8302, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": 8303, "label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "Again this is way easier than differentiating ratios of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're only differentiating the numerator and the denominator separately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this is the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the justification for this comes only when you win in the end and get the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because what the theorem says is that if <EXPRESSION> of these limits exists, then the preceding <EXPRESSION> exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And once the preceding <EXPRESSION> exists, then the <EXPRESSION> before it exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So once we know that this <EXPRESSION> exists, that works backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the logical structure here is a little subtle, which is that if the right side exists, then the left side will also exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why does the right-hand limit have to exist, isn't it just the derivative that has to exist?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of the numerator has to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of the denominator has to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this limit has to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What doesn't have to exist, by the way, I never said that <EXPRESSION> has to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it's much, much more subtle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not claiming that <EXPRESSION> exists, because in order to evaluate this limit, <EXPRESSION> need not exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What has to happen is that nearby, for <EXPRESSION> not = <EXPRESSION>, these things exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the limit has to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's no requirements that the limits exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that's exactly going to be the point when we evaluate these limits here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is we don't have to evaluate it right at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question that you're asking is, why is this the hypothesis of the theorem?", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, why does this work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the answer is that this is a theorem that's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you drop this hypothesis, it's totally false.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you don't have this hypothesis, you can't use the theorem and you will get the wrong answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it's hard to express it any further than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So look, in many cases we tell you formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in many cases it's so obvious when they're true that we don't have to worry about what we say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, there's something implicit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm saying well, you know, if I wrote this symbol down, it must mean that the thing exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a subtle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what I'm emphasizing is that you don't need to know in advance that this <EXPRESSION> exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You do need to know in advance that that <EXPRESSION> exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Essentially, yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the direction that it goes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can't get away with not having this exist and still have the statement be true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but let me just say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nevertheless, this theorem applies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll be able to use it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, neither of these well, actually, come to think of it, <EXPRESSION>, if you like, it's = <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want to say that it has a value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in fact, these expressions don't necessarily have values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And nevertheless, the theorem applies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it can exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's perfectly OK for it to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's no problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just doesn't need to exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It isn't forced to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a calculation which we just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we evaluated this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I want to make a comparison with the method of approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We would use <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We would use that linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what we would have here is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, which is of course <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for this <EXPRESSION>, you have to remember the approximation near <EQUATION> to the cosine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, sure enough, this simplifies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This becomes <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get the same answer, which is a good thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because both of these methods are valid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're consistent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see that neither of them is particularly a lot longer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You may have trouble remembering this property.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in fact it's something that you can easily derive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're almost the same amount of numerical content to them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now what I'd like to do is explain to you why L'Hopital's Rule works better in some cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the real value that it has is in handling these other more exotic limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we're going to do L'Hopital's Rule over again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll handle these functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll have to rewrite them, but we'll just do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the property.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the property.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is what we'll always be using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very convenient thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember it was true provided that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that the right-hand side exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I claim that it works better, and I'll get rid of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll write them again to show you that it works for these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are other cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other cases that are allowed are this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all, as indicated by what I just erased, you can allow <EXPRESSION> to be = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can take the limit going to the far ends of the universe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Both left and right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other thing that you can do is, you can allow <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a very powerful tool, and quite different from the other cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing is that the right-hand side doesn't really quite have to exist, in the ordinary sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's also OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's still information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we can see where it goes, then we're still good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it goes to <EXPRESSION>, if it goes to <EXPRESSION>, if it goes to a finite number, if it goes to <EXPRESSION>, all of that will be OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just if it oscillates wildly that we'll be lost.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And those calculations we'll never encounter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this basically handles everything that you could possibly hope for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a very convenient process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me carry out a few examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, let's see, I guess the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> that I wanted to do was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what example are we up to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> was on our homework problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the limits of some calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But so this <EXPRESSION>, you have to look at it <EXPRESSION> to think about what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an indeterminate form, but it sort of looks like it's the wrong type.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why is it in an indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, and this <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, excuse me, this is a product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The product could be anything in between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> step is to write this as a ratio of things, rather than a product of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it turns out that the way to do that is to use the <EXPRESSION> in the numerator, and the <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a choice that I'm making here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I've just converted it to a limit of the type <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the numerator is going to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> and the denominator <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, there's a competitions, but now it's <EXPRESSION> of the forms to which L'Hopital's Rule applies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm just going to apply L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": [{"id": 8390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 8391, "label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "And what it says is that I differentiate here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just differentiate a numerator and denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8392, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 8393, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 8394, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "And now it just simplifies and we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> plus of, well, the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 8398, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 59}, {"id": 8399, "label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "This is the same as just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> factors cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 8402, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is that it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> faster then <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> was the winner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something you can't necessarily predict in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do the other <EXPRESSION> examples that I wrote down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do them in slightly more generality, because they're the most fundamental rate properties that you're going to need to know for the next section.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is improper integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also they're just very important for physical math, and any other kind of thing, basically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, let's just do these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I wrote down the limit of <EXPRESSION>, but I'm going to make it even more general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to make it any negative power here, where <EXPRESSION> is some positive constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now again, this is a product of functions, not a quotient, a ratio, of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I need to rewrite it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8416, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And now that's the same as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where does that go?", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we can decide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> stays where it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the conclusion is that <EXPRESSION> grows more slowly then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION> is positive here, of course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the increasing exponentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not the decreasing ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do a variant of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it the opposite way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It really doesn't give us any more information, but it gives you just a little bit more practice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So suppose I look at things the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> divided by, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8434, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Now, this is an <EXPRESSION> example, again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can work out what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there are <EXPRESSION> ways of thinking about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the slow way and the fast way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Apply L'Hopital's Rule over and over and over and over again.", "entities": [{"id": 8437, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"id": 8438, "label": "method", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "All the way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's clear that you could do it, but it's kind of a nuisance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a much cleverer trick here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that <EXPRESSION> is that this is the same as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of, well it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our L'Hopital's step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, again I did this in a slightly different way to show you that it works with infinity as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was this other case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The right-hand side can exist, or it can be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that applies to this limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, to the original limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the conclusion here is that <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, grows faster than any power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I picked <EXPRESSION>, but obviously it didn't matter what power I picked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The exponents beat all the powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> more of the ones that I gave at the beginning to take care of.", "entities": [{"id": 8455, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And that <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And its behavior at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll do a slightly variant on that <EXPRESSION>, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now this, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, is of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION>, and here I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, when the dust settles here and you get your exponents right, we have an <EXPRESSION>, and this is an <EXPRESSION>, and that's a <EXPRESSION> becomes a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's = to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which we can decide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the conclusion is that <EXPRESSION> grows more slowly as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, than <EXPRESSION> or any positive power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So any <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> positive, will work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is really slow, going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's very, very gradual.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, how many hypotheses do you need here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I said that, and I think what you were asking is, if I have this hypothesis, can I also have this hypothesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can have this hypothesis combined with this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need something about <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can't assume nothing about <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, I have to be faced with either an <EXPRESSION>, or a <EXPRESSION> situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A rule applies in the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the only <EXPRESSION> cases that it applies in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a can be anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Including <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rule applies in these <EXPRESSION> cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, this is what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either <EXPRESSION> of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, it can be plus or minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the right-hand side has to be something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has to be either finite or <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You need a specific value of <EXPRESSION>, you need to decide whether it's an indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you need the right-hand limit to exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not hard to impose this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because when you look at the right-hand side, you'll want to be calculating it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you want to know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you'll never have problems confirming this hypothesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give you <EXPRESSION> more example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is just slightly trickier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which involves, so here's another indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8510, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So there are lots of these things where you just don't know what to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they come out in various different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The simplest example of this is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> from above of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order to work out what's happening with this <EXPRESSION>, we have to use a trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the trick is this is a moving exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so it's appropriate to use base <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is something that we did way back in the <EXPRESSION> unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, since we have a moving exponent, we're going to use base <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the good base to use whenever you have a moving exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so rewrite this as <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8519, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And now, in order to figure out what's happening, we really only have to know what's going on with the exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember, actually we already did this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to do it once more for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what we have here is that this <EXPRESSION> is going to be equivalent to, well, it's going to tend to what we got over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That exponent is what we want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the answer This limit happens to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's actually relatively easy to do, given all of the power that we have at our hands.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me give you <EXPRESSION> more example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose you're trying to understand the limit of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, if you look at the linear approximation method, linear approximation says that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>, which goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, at least from <EXPRESSION> side, <EXPRESSION> to the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's something fishy going on here, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is fishy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or maybe this is fishy, I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, tell me what's wrong here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the claim is that the <EXPRESSION> application of L'Hopital's Rule, this <EXPRESSION>, is wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where you have to watch out, with L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is exactly where you have to watch out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to apply the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it's an indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> before I applied the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this <EXPRESSION> isn't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's no longer an indeterminate form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually infinite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, depending on the sign of the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is just what this answer is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the linear approximation is safe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we just applied L'Hopital's Rule wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the moral of the story here is look before you L'Hop.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me say <EXPRESSION> more thing.", "entities": [{"id": 8566, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "I need to pile it on just a little bit, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So don't use it as a crutch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't want to just get ourselves so weak, after being in the hospital for all this time, that we can't use, I'm sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember that you shouldn't have lost your senses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have something like this, so we'll do this <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose you're trying to understand what this does as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you could L'Hopital's Rule <EXPRESSION> times, or <EXPRESSION> times.", "entities": [{"id": 8572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 50}, {"id": 8573, "label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "And get the answer here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really, you should realize that the main terms are sitting there right in front of you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that there's some algebra that you can do to simplify this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, it's the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the denominator, well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this would be dividing by <EXPRESSION> in both numerator and denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8577, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8578, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 59}, {"id": 8579, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "But that's OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the main term, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you like, much more simply, just <EXPRESSION> is the main term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So don't forget your basic algebra when you're doing this kind of stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Use these things and don't use L'Hopital's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, see you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me start by basically listing the main things we have learned over the past <EXPRESSION> weeks or so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will add a few complements of information about that because there are a few small details that I didn't quite clarify and that I should probably make a bit clearer, especially what happened at the very end of yesterday's class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is a list of things that should be on your review sheet for the exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing we learned about, the main topic of this unit is about functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have learned how to think of functions of <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> variables in terms of plotting them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, well, not only the graph but also the contour plot and how to read a contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have learned how to study variations of these functions using partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's define <EQUATION>", "entities": [{"id": 8597, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Let's say you have <EQUATION> this symbol means you differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION> treating <EXPRESSION> as a constant.", "entities": [{"id": 8601, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And we have learned how to package partial derivatives into a vector, the gradient vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, let's say we have a function <EQUATION>, the vector whose components are the partial derivatives.", "entities": [{"id": 8603, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And we have seen how to use the gradient vector or the partial derivatives to derive various things such as approximation formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The change in <EXPRESSION>, when we change <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> slightly, is approximately =, well, there are several terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Rewrite <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8610, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "And, in particular, this approximation is called the tangent plane approximation because it tells us, in fact, it amounts to identifying the graph of the function with its tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It means that we assume that the function depends more or less linearly on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if we set <EQUATION>, what we get is actually, we are replacing the function by its linear approximation.", "entities": [{"id": 8620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "We are replacing the graph by its tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except, of course, we haven't see the graph of a function of <EXPRESSION> variables because that would live in <EXPRESSION>-dimensional space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's draw the graph of <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8624, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So, when we think of a graph, really, it is a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That also tells us how to find tangent planes to level surfaces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Recall that the tangent plane to a surface, given by the equation <EQUATION>, at a given point can be found by looking <EXPRESSION> for its normal vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know that the normal vector is actually, well, <EXPRESSION> normal vector is given by the gradient of a function because we know that the gradient is actually pointing perpendicularly to the level sets towards higher values of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it gives us the direction of fastest increase of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions about these topics?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me add, actually, a cultural note to what we have seen so far about partial derivatives and how to use them, which is maybe something I should have mentioned a couple of weeks ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do we like partial derivatives?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> obvious reason is we can do all these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But another reason is that, really, you need partial derivatives to do physics and to understand much of the world that is around you because a lot of things actually are governed by what is called partial differentiation equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you want a cultural remark about what this is good for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A partial differential equation is an equation that involves the partial derivatives of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have some function that is unknown that depends on a bunch of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a partial differential equation is some relation between its partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are equations involving the partial derivatives of an unknown function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give you an example to see how that works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is the equation Well, let me write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8632, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "It is the equation partial <EXPRESSION> = some constant times the sum of the <EXPRESSION> partials with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an equation where we are trying to solve for a function <EXPRESSION> that depends, actually, on <EXPRESSION> variables, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what should you have in mind?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this equation governs temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you think that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> will be the temperature at a point in space at position <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and at time <EXPRESSION>, then this tells you how temperature changes over time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do we take the partial derivative twice?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that is a question, I would say, for a physics person.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in a few weeks we will actually see a derivation of where this equation comes from and try to justify it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, really, that is something you will see in a physics class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason for that is basically physics of how heat is transported between particles in fluid, or actually any medium.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells you how well the heat flows through the material that you are looking at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I am giving it to you just to show you an example of a real life problem where, in fact, you have to solve <EXPRESSION> of these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, how to solve partial differential equations is not a topic for this class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you will see it is already quite hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if you want more on that <EXPRESSION>, we have many fine classes about partial differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> thing at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted to point out to you that very often functions that you see in real life satisfy many nice relations between the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was in case you were wondering why on the syllabus for today it said partial differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have officially covered the topic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is basically all we need to know about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we will come back to that a bit later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If there are no further questions, let me continue and go back to my list of topics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should have written down that this equation is solved by temperature for point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are, actually, many other interesting partial differential equations you will maybe sometimes learn about the wave equation that governs how waves propagate in space, about the diffusion equation, when you have maybe a mixture of <EXPRESSION> fluids, how they somehow mix over time and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Basically, to every problem you might want to consider there is a partial differential equation to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Back to my list of topics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> important application we have seen of partial derivatives is to try to optimize things, try to solve minimum/maximum problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember that we have introduced the notion of critical points of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A critical point is when all the partial derivatives are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there are various kinds of critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is maxima and there is minimum, but there is also saddle points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Set the right hand side to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8669, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 8670, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And plug in <EQUATION> on the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8672, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 8673, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "And we have also seen that actually that is not enough to find the minimum of a maximum of a function because the minimum of a maximum could occur on the boundary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is a point where the <EXPRESSION> derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's graph <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8679, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "And we used the <EXPRESSION> derivative to see that this critical point is a local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then, when we are looking for the minimum of a function, well, it is not at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is actually here at the boundary of the domain, you know, the range of values that we are going to consider.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here the minimum is at the boundary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the maximum is at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we can use these methods to find where they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, somewhere on the boundary of a set of values that are allowed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be that we actually achieve a minimum by making <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> as small as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe letting them go to <EXPRESSION> if they had to be positive or maybe by making them go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have to keep our minds open and look at various possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are going to do a problem like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are going to go over a practice problem from the practice test to clarify this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here I have some good news for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "While you should definitely know what this is about, it will not be on the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That doesn't mean that you should forget everything we have seen about it, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what is next on my list of topics?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have seen differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember the differential of <EXPRESSION>, by definition, would be this kind of quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EXPRESSION> it looks just like a new way to package partial derivatives together into some new kind of object.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is this good for?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is a good way to remember approximation formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is a good way to also study how variations in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> relate to variations in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, we can divide this by variations, actually, by <EXPRESSION> or by <EXPRESSION> or by <EXPRESSION> in any situation that we want, or by <EXPRESSION> of some other variable to get chain rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The chain rule says, for example, there are many situations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we can ask ourselves, how sensitive is <EXPRESSION> to a value of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can answer that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The chain rule is something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we apply the chain rule to <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 8708, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And let me explain to you again where this comes from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Basically, what this quantity means is if we change <EXPRESSION> and keep <EXPRESSION> constant, what happens to the value of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, why would the value of <EXPRESSION> change in the <EXPRESSION> place when <EXPRESSION> is just a <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and not directly of you?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it changes because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> we have to figure out how quickly <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> change when we change <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel out <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 8728, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 8729, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "And simplify the left hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 8730, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 8731, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "How much does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> tells us how quickly <EXPRESSION> changes if I just change <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the change in <EXPRESSION> caused just by the fact that <EXPRESSION> changes when <EXPRESSION> changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then <EXPRESSION> also changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> changes at this rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that causes <EXPRESSION> to change at that rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> changes as well, and that causes <EXPRESSION> to change at that rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the effects add up together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that make sense?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, in particular, we can use the chain rule to do changes of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we have <EQUATION> and finally, last but not least, we have seen how to deal <EXPRESSION> with non-independent <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": [{"id": 8762, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "Of course, on the exam, you can be sure that I will make sure that you cannot solve for a variable you want to remove because that would be too easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then when we have to look at all of them, we will have to take into account this relation, we have seen <EXPRESSION> useful methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of them is to find the minimum of a maximum of a function when the variables are not independent, and that is the method of Lagrange multipliers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, to find the minimum or the maximum of the function <EXPRESSION>, subject to the constraint <EXPRESSION> = constant, well, we write down equations <EQUATION> <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8769, "label": "command", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 140}]}
{"text": "There is a new variable here, lambda, the multiplier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is wrong?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we don't have actually <EXPRESSION> independent variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We also have this relation, whatever the constraint was relating <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we can try to solve this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, depending on the situation, it is sometimes easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it sometimes it is very hard or even impossible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But on the test, I haven't decided yet, but it could well be that the problem about Lagrange multipliers just asks you to write the equations and not to solve them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I don't know yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am not promising anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, before you start solving, check whether the problem asks you to solve them or not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it doesn't then probably you shouldn't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another topic that we solved just yesterday is constrained partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we are in the same situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a function, let's say, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> where variables <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are not independent but are constrained by some relation of this form.", "entities": [{"id": 8821, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Some quantity involving <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> = maybe <EXPRESSION> or some other constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I cannot keep all the other constant because that would not be compatible with this condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean that would be the usual or so-called formal partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> ignoring the constraint.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To take this into account means that if we vary <EXPRESSION> variable while keeping another <EXPRESSION> fixed then the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, since it depends on them, must also change somehow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we must take that into account.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say, for example, we want to find I am going to do a different example from yesterday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you really didn't like that <EXPRESSION>, you don't have to see it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does that mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EXPRESSION> is constant, <EXPRESSION> varies and <EXPRESSION> somehow is mysteriously a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> for this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, of course because it depends on <EXPRESSION>, that means <EXPRESSION> will vary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> varies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we are asking ourselves what is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> in this situation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we have <EXPRESSION> methods to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Using differentials means that we will try to express <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION> in this particular situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do we know about <EXPRESSION> in general?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the general statement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, of course, we are in a special case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are in a special case where <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is constant means that we can set <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing is actually we don't care about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we need is to relate <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, to do that, we need to look at how the variables are related so we need to look at the constraint <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We look at the differential <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> doesn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> doesn't change then we have a relation between <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in fact, we say we are going to look only at the case where <EXPRESSION> is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, now we have a relation between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want, this is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> when we keep <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In our new terminology this is partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that will tell us that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is now <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this coefficient here is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the situation we are considering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This quantity is what we call partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is what we wanted to find.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's see another way to do the same calculation and then you can choose which <EXPRESSION> you prefer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other method is using the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We use the chain rule to understand how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me <EXPRESSION> try the chain rule brutally and then we will try to analyze what is going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can just use the version that I have up there as a template to see what is going on, but I am going to explain it more carefully again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the most mechanical and mindless way of writing down the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am just saying here that I am varying <EXPRESSION>, keeping <EXPRESSION> constant, and I want to know how <EXPRESSION> changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> might change because <EXPRESSION> might change, <EXPRESSION> might change and <EXPRESSION> might change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, how quickly does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> in this situation is partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I change <EXPRESSION> at this rate then <EXPRESSION> will change at that rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> might change, so the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> would be the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> holding <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wait a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is held constant then <EXPRESSION> doesn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, this guy is <EXPRESSION> and you didn't really have to write that term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I wrote it just to be systematic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> had been somehow able to change at a certain rate then that would have caused <EXPRESSION> to change at that rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, if <EXPRESSION> is held constant then nothing happens here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Finally, while <EXPRESSION> is changing at a certain rate, this rate is this <EXPRESSION> and that causes <EXPRESSION> to change at that rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we add the effects together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, it is nothing but the good-old chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just I have put these extra subscripts to tell us what is held constant and what isn't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, of course we can simplify it a little bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because, here, how quickly does <EXPRESSION> change if I am changing <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the rate of change of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to itself, is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, the really mysterious part of this is the <EXPRESSION> here, which is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, to find that, we have to understand the constraint.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How can we find the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we could use differentials, like we did here, but we can also keep using the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How can I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I can just look at how <EXPRESSION> would change with respect to <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just do the same calculation with <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if <EXPRESSION> is held constant then, when we vary <EXPRESSION> keeping <EXPRESSION> constant and changing <EXPRESSION>, well, <EXPRESSION> still doesn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is held constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if we just say that, we are not going to get to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see how we can compute that using the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the chain rule tells us <EXPRESSION> changes because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How does it change because of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How does it change because of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how quickly <EXPRESSION> changes here, of course, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can just write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 8991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And now we found how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we plug that into that and we get our answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes all the way up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we get the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am not going to, well, I guess I can write it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There was partial <EXPRESSION> times this guy, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can observe that this is exactly the same formula that we had over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, let's compare this to make it side by side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim we did exactly the same thing, just with different notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> methods are pretty much the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Quick poll.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Who prefers this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Majority vote seems to be for differentials, but it doesn't mean that it is better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Both are fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can use whichever <EXPRESSION> you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you should give both a try.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I forgot to mention it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where did that go?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I erased that part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need to know directional derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is pretty much all we know about them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other topics that I forgot to list?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think what we should do now is look quickly at the practice test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, given the time, you will mostly have to think about it yourselves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you have a copy of the practice exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> problem is a simple problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find an approximation formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you know how to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> problem is <EXPRESSION> about writing a contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, before I let you go for the weekend, I want to make sure that you actually know how to read a contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> thing I should mention is this problem asks you to estimate partial derivatives by writing a contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have not done that, so that will not actually be on the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will be doing qualitative questions like what is the sine of a partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it <EXPRESSION>, less than <EXPRESSION> or more than <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't need to bring a ruler to estimate partial derivatives the way that this problem asks you to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's look at problem <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try and see what is going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A point where <EQUATION>, well, that should be probably on the level curve that says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can actually zoom in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is the level <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I want partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means if I change <EXPRESSION>, keeping <EXPRESSION> constant, the value of <EXPRESSION> doesn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which points on the level curve satisfy that property?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is the top and the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you are here, for example, and you move in the <EXPRESSION> direction, well, you see, as you get to there from the left, the height <EXPRESSION> increases and then decreases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes for a maximum at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at that point, the partial derivative is <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means if we go north we should go down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, which <EXPRESSION> is it, top or bottom?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, if you go north, then you go from <EXPRESSION> down to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is where the point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the problem here was also asking you to estimate partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you were curious how you would do that, well, you would try to figure out how long it takes before you reach the next level curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the change in height when you go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you go down from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is actually <EXPRESSION> exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION>, well, <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is an approximation for partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that is how you would do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me go back to other things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look at this practice exam, basically there is a bit of everything and it is kind of fairly representative of what might happen on Tuesday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There will be a mix of easy problems and of harder problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Expect something about computing gradients, approximations, rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Expect a problem about reading a contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean pretty much all the topics are going to be there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today we're going to continue our discussion of methods of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The method that I'm going to describe today handles a whole class of functions of the following form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take <EXPRESSION> and this is known as a rational function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all that means is that it's a ratio off <EXPRESSION> polynomials, which are these functions <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll handle all such functions by a method which is known as partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what this does is, it splits <EXPRESSION> into what you could call easier pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's going to be some kind of algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we're going to spend most of our time doing today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll start with an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all of my examples will be illustrating more general methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's easy to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just, we already know the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's the difficulty that is going to arise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The difficulty is that I can start with this function, which is perfectly manageable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And than I can add these <EXPRESSION> functions together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way I add fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's getting a common denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope there aren't too many more of those transformations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is there another <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, it happened earlier on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wow that's an interesting vibration there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I guess my <EXPRESSION>'s were speaking to my <EXPRESSION>'s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somewhere in my past.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, anyway, I think this is now correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the problem is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the problem with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This integral was easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm calling it easy, we already know how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now over here, it's disguised.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same function, but it's no longer clear how to integrate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you're faced with this <EXPRESSION>, you say what am I supposed to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have to get around that difficulty.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what we're going to do is we're going to unwind this disguise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the algebra problem that we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, wow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There must be something in the water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Impressive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Holy cow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'll keep you awake today with several other transpositions here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our algebra problem is to detect the easy pieces which are inside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the method that we're going to use, the <EXPRESSION> that we'll emphasize anyway, is <EXPRESSION> algebraic trick which is a shortcut, which is called the cover-up method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're going to talk about even more general things than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, this is where we're headed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is something called the cover-up method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's our intro.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll just have to remember that <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll keep on repeating that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now here I'm going to describe to you how we unwind this disguise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> step is, we write down the function we want to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which was this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that factors, we happen to know the factors, so I'm not going to carry this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this can be a rather difficult step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're going to assume that it's done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the purposes of illustration here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I factor the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the <EXPRESSION> thing that I'm going to do is what I'm going to call the setup here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How I'm going to set things up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll tell you what these things are more systematically in a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the setup is that I want to somehow detect what I did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to write some unknowns here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, my <EXPRESSION> step is going to be to solve for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm done, if I do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the complete unwinding of this disguise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where the cover-up method comes in handy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is this method that I'm about to describe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you can do the algebra in a clumsy way, or you can do it in a quick way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'd like to get efficient about the algebra involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the right-hand side you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9124, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 9125, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>'s cancel again.", "entities": [{"id": 9128, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And then we get this extra term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the trick here, and we're going to get even better trick in just a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The trick here is that I didn't try to clear the denominators completely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was very efficient about the way I did it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if I plug in now <EQUATION>, this term drops out too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "That's the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is my formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A happens to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's, of course, what I expect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A had better be <EXPRESSION>, because the thing broke up into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the correct answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There was a question out here, which I missed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Aren't polynomials defined as functions with whole powers, or could they be square roots?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Are polynomials defined as functions with whole powers, or can they be square roots?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, they only have whole powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for instance here I only have the power <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here I have the powers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Square roots are no good for this method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why did I say <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason why I said <EQUATION> was that it works really fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can't know this in advance, that's part of the method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just turns out to be the best thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The fastest way of getting at the coefficient A.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the curious thing, let me just pause for a <EXPRESSION> before I do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that seems like the most horrible thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The worst possible thing to do, is to set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9330, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "On the other hand, what we did is a trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9333, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And that turned the equation into this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, in disguise, I multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9335, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "But that turns out to be legitimate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because really this equation is true for all <EXPRESSION> except <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then instead of taking <EQUATION>, I can really take <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's really what I need.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The limit is <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The equation is still valid then.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm using the worst case, the case that looks like it's dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the advantage here is this cancellation that occurs in this part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to shorten it much, much more in a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let me carry it out for the other coefficient as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the other coefficient I'm going to solve for <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9348, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "And then again the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 9352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION> sitting alone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to do the same trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "That's the value which is going to knock out this <EXPRESSION> term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we get here all told is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EQUATION>, which was also what it was supposed to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> was this number <EXPRESSION>, right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I'm now not going to change to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I know that it's not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There was a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is the method which is called cover-up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's really carried out much, much faster than this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to review the method and I'm going to show you what it is in general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> step is to factor the denominator, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9365, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 37}, {"id": 9366, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "That's what I labeled <EXPRESSION> over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was the factorization of the denominator up top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> step is what I'm going to call the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's where I knew what I was aiming for in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to have to explain to you in every instance exactly what this setup should be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, what the unknowns should be and what target, simplified expression, we're aiming for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> step is what I'll now call cover-up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is just a very fast way of doing what I did on this last board, which is solving for the unknown coefficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let me perform it for you again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Handwriting it makes it much faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, that's the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I claim that without writing very much, I can figure out what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just by staring at this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to think what I did over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm just going to do it directly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me show you what the method consists of visually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to cover up, that is, knock out this factor, and focus on this number here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to plug in the thing that makes the <EXPRESSION>, which is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm plugging in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9378, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "To this left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I get is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's the same thing I did over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just did it by skipping the intermediate algebra step, which is a lot of writing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the cover-up method really amounts to the following thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm thinking of multiplying this over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It cancels this and it gets rid of everything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to get rid of it on this side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, by eliminating this, I'm isolating a on the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the cover-up is that I'm covering this and getting <EXPRESSION> out of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, I can do the same thing with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's focused on the value <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is what I'm getting on the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to cover up this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I cover up that, then what's left over with <EQUATION> is again, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the way the method gets carried out in practice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Writing, essentially, the least you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, when you get to several variables, it becomes just way more convenient to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let me just review when cover-up works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this cover-up method works if <EXPRESSION> has distinct linear factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so you need <EXPRESSION> things here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has to factor completely, the denominator has to factor completely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the degree of the numerator has to be strictly less than the degree of the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to give you an example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for instance, and this tells you the general pattern of the setup also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say you had <EXPRESSION>, let's say.", "entities": [{"id": 9390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9392, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "So here I'm going to tell you the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it will always break up into something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So however many factors you have, you'll have to put in a term for each of those.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you can find each number here by this cover-up method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're done with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have to go on to the algebraic complications.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So would the <EXPRESSION> typical algebraic complication be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be repeated roots or repeated factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me get <EXPRESSION> that doesn't come out to be extremely ugly here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is going to work when the degree, you always need that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> has now repeated linear factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see which example I wanted to show you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just give this here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just repeat the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With an extra factor like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the main thing you need to know, since I've already performed the factorization for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to factor things all the way, and that's already been done for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's what this setup is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The setup is that it's of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need another term for the square here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In general, if you have more powers you just need to keep on putting in those powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why does it have to be squared?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why in the world am I doing this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just give you <EXPRESSION> hint as to why I'm doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for, example the number <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, is that right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this sort of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm getting this power and this power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I have higher powers, I'm going to have to have more and more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what happens when I have a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to represent things like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's coming out of this piece with the repetitious here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of the powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just an analogy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of what we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an example, but it's meant to represent the general case and I will also give you a general picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For sure, once you have the <EXPRESSION> power here, you'll need both the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> power mentioned over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since there's only a <EXPRESSION> power over here I only have to mention a <EXPRESSION> power over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this were a <EXPRESSION> here, there would be <EXPRESSION> more term which would be the <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what you just said.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now, what's different about this setup is that the cover-up method, although it works, it doesn't work so well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't work quite as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cover-up works for the coefficients <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll have a quick method for the numbers <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To figure out what they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it will be a little slower to get to <EXPRESSION>, which we will do last.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me show you how it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all, I'm going to do the ordinary cover-up with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for <EXPRESSION>, I just want to do the same old thing that I did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I cover up this, and that's going to get rid of all the junk except for the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to plug <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9425, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION> sorry, I get <EXPRESSION> in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 9429, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 9430, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "Remember I'm covering this up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's all there is on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the right-hand side all there is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> over here canceled.", "entities": [{"id": 9435, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "This is the shortcut that I just described, and this is much faster than doing all that arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all together this is a <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the other <EXPRESSION> which is easy to do, I'm going to do by the slow method <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you omit a term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea is to cover up the other bad factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cover ups, I'll do it both the way and the slow way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it the fast way <EXPRESSION>, and then I'll show you the slow way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The fast way is to cover this up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to cover up everything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gets eliminated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that includes everything but <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION> on this side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION> on that side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was pretty fast, so let me show you what arithmetic was hiding behind that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What algebra was hiding behind it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I was really doing is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice again, I cleared out that <EXPRESSION>, this term from the denominator and sent it over to the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what's happening is that when I set <EQUATION> here, this term is dying.", "entities": [{"id": 9452, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "This term is going away, because there's more powers in the numerator than in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is still <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> is gone also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all that's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I cannot pull that off with a single power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I can multiply through by this thing squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's useless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I can't use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, the cover-up method is giving us <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, for the last term, for <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to just have to be straightforward about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'll just suggest for <EXPRESSION>, plug in your favorite number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So plug in my favorite number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here the <EXPRESSION> numbers we've already used are <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we haven't used <EQUATION> yet, so that's good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to plug in now <EQUATION> into the equation.", "entities": [{"id": 9476, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "What do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION> =, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A is the thing that I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> so <EQUATION>, so that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't give up at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a lot of algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You really have to plug in all these numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You make <EXPRESSION> arithmetic mistake and you're always going to get the wrong answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is very arithmetically intensive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, it does simplify at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "= <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've we've simplified our function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now it's easy to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, if <EQUATION> has already been used, what do I do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is, pick something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you said pick a random number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's right, except that if you really picked a random number it would be <EXPRESSION>, which would be difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What you want to pick is the easiest possible number you can think of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you had, as in this sort of situation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "More powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wouldn't you have more variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's absolutely right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we started with in the previous problem was <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as the degree of the denominator goes up, the number of variables goes up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It gets more and more and more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "More and more arithmetically intensive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, how would you solve it if you have <EXPRESSION> unknowns.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly the point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a system of simultaneous equations for unknowns.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have little tricks for isolating single variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Otherwise we're stuck with solving the whole system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'd have to solve the whole system by elimination, various other tricks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll say a little more about that later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I have to get <EXPRESSION> step more complicated with my next example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My next example is going to have a quadratic factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So still I'm sticking to the degree of the polynomial and the numerator is less than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to take the case where <EXPRESSION> has a quadratic factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just again illustrate this by example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll make it about as easy as they come.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the setup will be slightly different here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's already factored.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've already done as much as I can do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you know about complex numbers this method becomes much easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it comes back to the cover-up method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the way that the cover-up method was originally conceived by heavy side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll wait.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This, by the way, is a method which is used for integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it was invented to do something with Laplace transforms and inversion of certain kinds of differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By heavy side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so it came much later than integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, it's a very convenient method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the set up with this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's now going to be a <EXPRESSION> degree polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> degree down from the quadratic here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to know that in advance based on the pattern that you see on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, if the degree of the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to have to do something totally different to handle it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which turns out, fortunately, to be much easier than this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll deal with that at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Keep this in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an easy way to make a mistake if you start with a higher degree numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll never get the right answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, so I have my setup now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what can I do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I claim that I can still do cover-up for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I cover this guy up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I really multiply by it it would knock everything out but <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10251, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "So I cover this up and I plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9511, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So I get here <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again cover-up is pretty fast, as you can see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not too bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, at this next stage, I want to find <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the best idea is the slow way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, it's not too terrible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's just what we're going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is to clear the denominators completely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, just clear the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means multiply through by that whole business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I got rid of the whole denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the right-hand side when I bring this up, the <EXPRESSION> will cancel with this.", "entities": [{"id": 10253, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 73}, {"id": 10254, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> term will have a remaining factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the <EXPRESSION> will cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 9525, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "Again, the arithmetic here is not too terrible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm going to do the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to look at the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the left-hand side and the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that will give me <EXPRESSION> equation for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to do the same thing with another term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> term on the left-hand side, the coefficient is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other side, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember I actually have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to put it in, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the only other <EXPRESSION> is when this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, so this is the other coefficient on <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that forces <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And last of all, I'm going to do the <EXPRESSION> power term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, otherwise known as the constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the left-hand side, the constant term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is no constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the right-hand side there's a constant term, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's another constant term, which is this constant times this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the conclusion here is that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's also an <EXPRESSION> power hidden in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, an <EXPRESSION> , that's what you were asking about, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's also an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only reason why I didn't go to the <EXPRESSION> is that it turns out with these <EXPRESSION> I didn't need it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other thing is that by experience, I know that the extreme ends of the multiplication are the easiest ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the middle terms have tons of cross terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I don't like the middle term as much because it always involves more arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I stick to the lowest and the highest terms if I can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was really a sneaky thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did that without saying anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Could I just set = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 10255, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Absolutely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that's equivalent to picking out the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could plug in numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you wanted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's another way of doing this besides doing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can also plug in numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can plug in numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, not <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not <EXPRESSION> just because we've already used it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We won't get interesting information out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, could I have done it this other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With the polynomial, with this other <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, absolutely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words what I've taught you now is <EXPRESSION> choices which are equally reasonable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> that I picked was the <EXPRESSION> that was the fastest for this guy and the <EXPRESSION> that was fastest for this <EXPRESSION>, but I could've done the other way around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are a lot of ways of solving simultaneous equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now everybody can understand the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this, instead of being <EXPRESSION>, this were <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's an important case to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a case in which this denominator is not fully factored.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's an <EXPRESSION>, you would have to factor out an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9573, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "So that would be a situation like this, you have an <EXPRESSION>, but that's <EXPRESSION>, this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If that's the right, there must be a minus sign in here maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Isn't that what it is?I think it's right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, the point is that you have to factor it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have a linear and a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're always going to be faced eventually with linear factors and quadratic factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a cubic, that means you haven't factored sufficiently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once we've completed the factorization, we're going to have to deal with these <EXPRESSION> factors as denominators.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's eventually going to happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But hold on to that idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me carry out <EXPRESSION> more example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've figured out what all the values are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think it's also worth it to remember now that we also have to carry out the integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I've just shown you is that the integral of <EXPRESSION> is = to, and I've split up into these pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what are the pieces?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The pieces are, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'd better remember that we know how to antidifferentiate these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, I want to finish the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The others were pretty easy, so I didn't bother to finish my sentence, but here I want to be careful and have you realize that there's something a little more to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all we have the, the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is no problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> actually is not too bad either.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is, by the advanced guessing method, my favorite method, something like the logarithm, because that's what's going to appear in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, if you differentiate this, you're going to get <EXPRESSION> over this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So altogether it's <EXPRESSION> of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I fixed the coefficient here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the last <EXPRESSION>, you have to think back to some level of memorization here and remember that this is <EXPRESSION> the arc tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why did I go to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because in disguise, for this guy, I was thinking <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was what I applied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to save the general pattern for next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I do want to clarify <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's handle this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if the degree of <EXPRESSION> is bigger than or = the degree of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the thing that I claimed was easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to describe to you how it's done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in analogy, with numbers you might call this an improper fraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the thing that should echo in your mind when you're thinking about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm just going to do it by example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": ", I cooked up an example so that I don't make an arithmetistic mistake along the way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> steps that I need to explain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The denominator's degree <EXPRESSION>, the numerator is degree <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It well exceeds, so there's a problem here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our method is not going to work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, I don't want the factorization for what I'm going to do next.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want it multiplied out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm back to the starting place here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the next thing that I'm going to do is, I'm going to use long division.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how you convert an improper fraction to a proper fraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's how it works in the case of polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of amusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, that's going to match the top terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I subtract.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it cancels.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I need to divide this next term in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I need <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I subtract.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 9620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "And here I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this thing has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is called the quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this thing also has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is called the remainder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'll show you how it works by sticking it into the answer here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The quotient is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the remainder is, let's get down there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the punchline here is that this thing is easy to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION>, you can use, now you can use cover-up, The method that we had before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the degree of the numerator is now below the degree of the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's now <EXPRESSION> degree and this is <EXPRESSION> degree.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What you can't do is use cover-up to start out with here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will give you the wrong answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the end for today, and see you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, basically the last few weeks, we've been doing derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we're going to integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So OK, so more precisely, we are going to be talking about double integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the picture is something like you have <EXPRESSION>; you have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, when we say the area of this region, of course, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, that's what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is negative, then we count negatively the area below the <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, now, when you have a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, then you can try to do the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, you can plot its graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its graph will be a surface in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we can try to look for the volume below the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we will call the double integral of the function over a certain region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's say that we have a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9645, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Then, we'll look at the volume that's below the graph <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let's draw a picture for what this means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can draw its graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The graph will be the surface with equation <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, I have to decide where I will integrate the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for that, I will choose some region in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I will integrate the function on that region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's over a region, <EXPRESSION>, in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I have this region <EXPRESSION> and I look at the piece of the graph that is above this region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we'll try to compute the volume of this solid here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's what the double integral will measure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll call that the double integral of our region, <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION> and I will have to explain what the notation means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, it's a double integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we'll have to indicate somehow the region over which we are integrating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, we'll come up with more concrete notations when we see how to actually compute these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the basic definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so actually, how do we define it, that's not really much of a definition yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we actually define this rigorously?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, for each little piece, you take the value of a function, and you multiply by the width of a piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives you a rectangular slice, and then you sum all of these rectangular slices together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here we'll do the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, well, let me put a picture up and explain what it does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're going to cut our origin into little pieces, say, little rectangles or actually anything we want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives us an estimate of a volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, what we do, oh, I still have a board here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and then we'll have each small piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Each small piece will have area <EXPRESSION> and it will be at some point, let's call it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and then, so what I do is actually I take the limit as the size of the pieces tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I have more and more smaller and smaller pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that gives me the double integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's not a very good sentence, but whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, OK, so that's the definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, we will have to see how to compute it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't actually compute it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you compute an integral in single variable calculus, you don't do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't cut into little pieces and sum the pieces together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've learned how to integrate functions using various formulas, and similarly here, we'll learn how to actually compute these things without doing that cutting into small pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so we'll have to learn which tricks work, and how exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, so what we'll do actually is we'll reduce the calculation of a double integral to <EXPRESSION> calculations of single integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, yeah that's a strong suggestion that if you've forgotten everything about single variable calculus, now would be a good time to actually brush up on integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The usual integrals, and the usual substitution tricks and easy trig in particular, these would be very useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, yeah, how do we compute these things?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we would have to come up with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what we are going to do is instead of cutting into a lot of small boxes like that and summing completely at random, we will actually somehow scan through our region by parallel planes, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me put up, actually, a slightly different picture up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take planes, say in this picture, parallel to the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll take a moving plane that scans from the back to the front or from the front to the back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now in each slice, well, I get what looks a lot like a single variable integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and that integral will tell me, what is the area in this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, when I add all of these areas together, as the value of <EXPRESSION> changes, I will get the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let me try to explain that again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to compute this integral, what we do is actually we take slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so on the picture, <EXPRESSION> is just the area of this thing in the vertical wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you sum all of these, well, why does that work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you take the origin between <EXPRESSION> parallel slices that are very close to each other, what's the volume in these <EXPRESSION> things?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's essentially <EXPRESSION> times the thickness of this very thin slice, and the thickness would be <EXPRESSION> if you take a limit with more and more slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we would have to start at the very lowest value of <EXPRESSION> that ever happens in our origin, and we'd have to go all the way to the very largest value of <EXPRESSION>, from the very far back to the very far front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this picture, we probably start over here at the back, and we'd end over here at the front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now, it's an integral of the variable, <EXPRESSION>, because when we look at this slice, what changes from left to right is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, well let me actually write that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For a given, <EXPRESSION>, the area <EXPRESSION> you can compute as an integral of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, well, now <EXPRESSION> is a constant, and <EXPRESSION> will be the variable of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the range for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's from the leftmost point here to the rightmost point here on the given slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there is a big catch here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a very important thing to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the range of integration?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The range of integration for <EXPRESSION> depends actually on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, if I take the slice that's pictured on that diagram, then the range for y goes all the way from the very left to the very right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if I take a slice that, say, near the very front, then in fact, only a very small segment of it will be in my region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the range of values for <EXPRESSION> will be much less.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, remember, we fix <EXPRESSION>, so, sorry, so we fix a value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and for a given value of <EXPRESSION>, what we will do is we'll slice our graph by this plane parallel to the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now we mention the graph is sitting above that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's the region <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have the region, <EXPRESSION>, and I have the graph of a function above this region, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I'm trying to find the area between this segment and the graph above it in this vertical plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, to do that, I have to integrate from <EXPRESSION> going from here to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want the area of a piece that sits above this red segment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and so this is called an iterated integral because we iterate twice the process of taking an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which range of <EXPRESSION> do I want to look at to take my red slices?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the answer is I would go all the way from here, that's my <EXPRESSION> slice, to somewhere here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my last slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For any value in between these, I will have some red segment, and I will want to integrate over that that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I think we should do lots of examples to convince ourselves and see how it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, it's called an iterated integral because <EXPRESSION> we integrated over <EXPRESSION>, and then we integrate again over <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is more complicated is how the bounds on <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll see that on an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for <EXPRESSION>, I'm using the range of values for <EXPRESSION> that corresponds to the given value of <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, this is just like a plot in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Above that, we have the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should draw a picture here instead.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For a given value of <EXPRESSION>, so that's a given slice, I have a range of values for <EXPRESSION>, that is, from this picture at the leftmost point on that slice to the rightmost point on that slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, where start and where I stop depends on the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that make sense?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, no more questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do our <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say that we want to integrate the <EXPRESSION> over the region defined by <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9766, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 9767, "label": "method", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "So, what does that mean geometrically?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EQUATION>, and it's a variation on, actually I think we plotted that <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so, we saw that the graph is this paraboloid pointing downwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, it's what you get by taking a parabola and rotating it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, what we'll do is we'll, so, see, here I try to represent the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, of course, setting up the bounds will be easy because no matter what <EXPRESSION> I take, <EXPRESSION> still goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, it's easiest to do double integrals what the region is just a rectangle on the <EXPRESSION> plane because then you don't have to worry too much about what are the ranges.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that would be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm dropping the parentheses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if you still want to see them, I'm going to put that in very thin so that you see what it means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, actually, the convention is we won't put this parentheses in there anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what this means is <EXPRESSION> I will integrate <EXPRESSION>, ranging from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> held fixed.", "entities": [{"id": 9800, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "So, what that represents is the area in this slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, see here, I've drawn, well, what happens is actually the function takes positive and negative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, I will be counting positively this part of the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I will be counting negatively this part of the area, I mean, as usual when I do an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what I will do to evaluate this, I will <EXPRESSION> do what's called the inner integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to do the inner integral, well, it's pretty easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do I integrate this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it becomes, so, what's the integral of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just anything to remember is we are integrating this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, not to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, when you plug <EQUATION>, you will get <EXPRESSION> minus, well, for <EQUATION> you get <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so nothing changes.", "entities": [{"id": 9818, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 9819, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "OK, so you are left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and that's a <EXPRESSION> only.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, you shouldn't see any <EXPRESSION>'s anymore because <EXPRESSION> was your integration variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you still have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You still have <EXPRESSION> because the area of this shaded slice depends, of course, on the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so now, the <EXPRESSION> thing to do is to do the outer integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now we integrate from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> what we got, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9831, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "OK, and we know how to compute that because that integrates to <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I'll let you do the computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will find it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's the final answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's the general pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we have a double integral to compute, <EXPRESSION> we want to set it up carefully.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to find, what will be the bounds in <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, that was actually pretty easy because our equation was very simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, we want to compute the inner integral, and then we compute the outer integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions at this point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, by the way, we started with <EXPRESSION> in the notation, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we had <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that somehow became a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> became <EXPRESSION> because when we do the iterated integral this way, what we're actually doing is that we are slicing our origin into small rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that was the area of this small rectangle here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's the product of its <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually, it's not just becomes, it's really =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the small rectangles for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's a question of, in which order we do the iterated integral?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's up to us to decide whether we want to integrate <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9855, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "But, as we'll see very soon, that is an important decision when it comes to setting up the bounds of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, it doesn't matter, but in general we have to be very careful about in which order we will do things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in principle it always works both ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes it will be that because the region has a strange shape, you can actually set it up more easily <EXPRESSION> way or the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes it will also be that the function here, you actually know how to integrate in <EXPRESSION> way, but not the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the theory is that it should work both ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that what I wanted to know was not actually what I computed, namely, the volume below the paraboloid, but also the negative of some part that's now in the corner towards me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should stop integrating where my paraboloid hits the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me draw another picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we are going to do the same function but over a different region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the region will just be, now, this quarter disk here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's your region, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so in principle, it will be the same integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what changes is the bounds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do the bounds change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, on that picture here, on this picture, it tells me for a fixed value of <EXPRESSION>, the range of values for <EXPRESSION> should go only from here to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's from here to less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so for a given, <EXPRESSION>, the range of <EXPRESSION> is, well, so what's the lowest value of <EXPRESSION> that we want to look at?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's still <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From <EQUATION> to, what's the value of <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have to solve in the equation of a circle, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I'm here, this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I will integrate from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, now you see how the bound from y will depend on the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so while I erase, I will let you think about, what is the bound for <EXPRESSION> now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a trick question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we said for a fixed value of <EXPRESSION>, the range for <EXPRESSION> is from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the range for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the range for <EXPRESSION> should just be numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, remember, the question I have to ask now is if I look at all of these yellow slices, which <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> that I will consider?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will get smaller, and smaller, and smaller slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it stops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to stop when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Afterwards, there's nothing else to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and now, see how in the inner integral, the bounds depend on in the inner integral, the bounds depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, the question is, if I fix a given, <EXPRESSION>, if I look at a given slice, what's the range for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, the question is, what's the <EXPRESSION> slice?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the last slice?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that make sense?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everyone happy with that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, very good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, how do we compute that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we do the inner integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's an integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, that integrates to <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, that becomes, well, the root of <EXPRESSION> root of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, if you look at it for long enough, see, this says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, that's also, so, in fact, that simplifies to <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let me redo that, maybe, slightly differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9928, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So, I don't subtract anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now you see this is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you're left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, that's the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The outer integral is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, I let you see if you remember single variable integrals by trying to figure out what this actually comes out to be is it <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, actually?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, well I guess we have to do it then.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wrote something on my notes, but it's not very clear, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we compute this thing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we have to do trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the only way I know to compute an integral like that, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll set <EQUATION>, and then <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 9944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "We are using <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so that will become so, <EXPRESSION> remains <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, well, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, if you do things with substitution, which is the way I do them, then you should worry about the bounds for theta which will be <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, you can also just plug in the bounds at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now you have the <EXPRESSION> times the integral from <EXPRESSION> to p<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, how do you integrate that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you have to use double angle formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so <EXPRESSION>, remember, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we want the <EXPRESSION> of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so that will give us of, well, we'll have, it's actually <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, how will you handle this guy?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, using, again, the double angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's getting slightly nasty.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you do, again, the double angle formula, I think I'm not going to bother to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim you will get, at the end, <EXPRESSION> because I say so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so exercise, continue calculating and get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now what does the show us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this shows us, actually, that this is probably not the right way to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the right way to do this will be to integrate it in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's what we will learn how to do tomorrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we will actually see how to do it with much less trig.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that will be easier in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we will see that tomorrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we are almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, here you just use a double angle again and then you can get it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say we have an integral given to us in the order <EXPRESSION>, we can switch it to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, we have to be extremely careful with the bounds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that cannot work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's more complicated than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Certainly, if I do integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, there, I can certainly switch the bounds without thinking too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the reason for that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the reason for that is this corresponds in both cases to integrating <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I slice it this way, you see that <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> for any <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I slice it that way, then <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> for any value of <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in general, I have to draw picture of my region, and see how the slices look like both ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do a more interesting <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, why did I choose this guy?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the guy because as far as I can tell, there's no way to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is an integral that you cannot compute this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a good example for why this can be useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you do it this way, you are stuck immediately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, instead, we will try to switch the order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, to switch the order, we have to understand, what do these bounds mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's draw a picture of the region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what I am saying is <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's draw <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Well, maybe I should actually put this here, <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and so I will go, for each value of <EXPRESSION> I will go from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we'll do that for values of <EXPRESSION> that go from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>, which happens to be exactly where these things intersect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, my region will consist of all this, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, if I want to do it the other way around, I have to decompose my region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other way around, I have to, so my goal, now, is to rewrite this as an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's still the same function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's still <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now, I want to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do I integrate over <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I fix a value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, for that value of <EXPRESSION>, what's the range of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the range for <EXPRESSION> is from here to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, what's the value of <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's start with an easy <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and then what about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have to start at the bottom of my region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION> to the top, which is at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, switching the bounds is not completely obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That took a little bit of work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now that we've done that, well, just to see how it goes, it's actually going to be much easier to integrate because the inner integral, well, what's the integral of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that will be, well, if I plug <EQUATION>, I will get <EXPRESSION>, if I plug <EQUATION>, I will get <EXPRESSION> into the <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": [{"id": 10052, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 33}, {"id": 10053, "label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "So, now, if I do the outer integral, I will have the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that <EXPRESSION> actually is a little bit easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we know how to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't quite know how to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's try.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there's a product rule that's <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's almost what we want, except we have a <EXPRESSION> instead of a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we need to add <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10067, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And, I claim that's the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, if you got lost, you can also integrate by integrating by parts, by taking the derivative of <EXPRESSION> and integrating these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, but, you know, that works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just, your <EXPRESSION> guess would be, maybe, let's try <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the derivative of that, compare, see what you need to do to fix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, if you take that between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, you'll actually get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, tomorrow we are going to see how to do double integrals in polar coordinates, and also applications of double integrals, how to use them for interesting things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the last video I introduced you to the idea of the chain rule with partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the last video I didn't prove it to you, but I hopefully gave you a little bit of intuition that you can believe me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe <EXPRESSION> day I'll prove it a little bit more rigorously, but you can find proofs on the web if you are interested, for the chain rule with partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's put that aside and let's explore another property of partial derivatives, and then we're ready to get the intuition behind exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you're going to find, it's fairly straightforward to solve exact equations, but the intuition is a little bit more well, I don't want to say it's difficult, because if you have the intuition, you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what if I had, say, this function, <EXPRESSION>, and I were to take the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10090, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "I'll just write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10092, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "And then I were to take the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just as a notation, this you could write as, you could kind of view it as you're multiplying the operators, so it could be written like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that can also be written as and this is my preferred notation, because it doesn't have all this extra junk everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could just say, well, the partial, we took the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this just means the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we took the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> situation to consider.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens when we take the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>x, and then <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So with respect to <EXPRESSION>, you hold <EXPRESSION> constant to get just the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you hold the <EXPRESSION> constant, and you take the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the difference between that and if we were to switch the order?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just the notation, just so you're comfortable with it, that would be so partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it might be a little confusing that here, between these <EXPRESSION> notations, even though they're the same thing, the order is mixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just because it's just a different way of thinking about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This says, OK, partial <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This views it more as the operator, so we took the partial of <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, and then we took <EXPRESSION>, like you're multiplying the operators.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, so this can also be written as the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION> sorry, the partial of <EXPRESSION>, and then we took the partial of that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "our domain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If both of these functions are continuous, if both of the <EXPRESSION> partials are continuous, then these <EXPRESSION> are going to be = each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "Now, we can use this knowledge, which is the chain rule using partial derivatives, and this knowledge to now solve a certain class of differential equations, <EXPRESSION> order differential equations, called exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what does an exact equation look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "An exact equation looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The color picking's the hard part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say this is my differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have some <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I don't know, it could be <EXPRESSION> or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know, it could be any <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus some <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, we'll call that <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10148, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "This is well, I don't know if it's an exact equation yet, but if you saw something of this form, your <EXPRESSION> impulse should be, oh well, actually, your very <EXPRESSION> impulse is, is this separable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you should try to play around with the algebra a little bit to see if it's separable, because that's always the most straightforward way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it's not separable, but you can still put it in this form, you say, hey, is it an exact equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's an exact equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, look immediately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This pattern right here looks an awful lot like this pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if <EXPRESSION> was the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if this was <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what if this was <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just saying, we don't know for sure, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're just saying, what if?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this right here, the left side right there, that's the same thing as this, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the derivative of psi, with respect to x, using the partial derivative chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could rewrite it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could rewrite, this is just the <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So if you see a differential equation, and it has this form, and you say, boy, I can't separate it, but maybe it's an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And frankly, if that was what was recently covered before the current exam, it probably is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you see this form, you say, boy, maybe it's an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the partial of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if you could write it like this, and you take the derivative of both sides sorry, you take the antiderivative of both sides and you would get <EQUATION> as a solution.", "entities": [{"id": 10169, "label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 99}, {"id": 10170, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 118}, {"id": 10171, "label": "method", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 132}]}
{"text": "So there are <EXPRESSION> things that we should be caring you about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then you might be saying, OK, Sal, you've walked through psi's, and partials, and all this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, how do I know that it's an exact equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the way to figure out is it an exact equation, is to use this information right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we said, this is the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is an exact equation, if this is the exact equation, if we were take the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were to take the <EXPRESSION> so the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were to take the partial of those, with respect to <EXPRESSION> so we could just rewrite that as that then that should be = the <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we take the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, of both of these, we know from this that these should be =, if <EXPRESSION> and its partials are continuous over that domain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then this will also be =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is actually the test to test if this is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me rewrite all of that again and summarize it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you see something of the form, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you take the <EXPRESSION>, and then you take the <EXPRESSION>, and they are = to each other, then and it's actually if and only if, so it goes both ways this is an exact equation, an exact differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if it's an exact equation, that tells us that there exists a <EXPRESSION>, such that the <EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, is a solution of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll show you in the next video how to actually use this information to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here are some things I want to point out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be the <EXPRESSION>, but when we take the kind of exact test, we take it with respect to <EXPRESSION>, because we want to get that mixed derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I know that might be a little bit involved, but if you understood everything I did, I think you'll have the intuition behind why the methodology of exact equations works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what does that mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that we're now going to start involving the <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> class that I'm going to show you and this is probably the most useful class when you're studying classical physics are linear <EXPRESSION> order differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's something that looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what makes it linear?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, before we start trying to solve this generally, we'll do a special case of this, where <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> are constants and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what will that look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can just rewrite that as <EXPRESSION> so now <EXPRESSION> is not a function anymore, it's just a number <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10241, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 10242, "label": "command", "start_offset": 203, "end_offset": 207}, {"id": 10243, "label": "command", "start_offset": 221, "end_offset": 226}, {"id": 10244, "label": "command", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> is called homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I haven't made the connection yet on how these <EXPRESSION> order differential equations are related to the <EXPRESSION> order ones that I just introduced to these other homogeneous differential equations I introduced you to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think they just happen to have the same name, even though they're not that related.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the reason why this <EXPRESSION> is called homogeneous is because you have it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what makes it homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I do see more of a connection between this type of equation and milk where all the fat is spread out, because if you think about it, the solution for all homogeneous equations, when you kind of solve the equation, they always = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they're homogenized, I guess is the best way that I can draw any kind of parallel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could call this a <EXPRESSION> order linear because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> definitely are functions just of well, they're not even functions of <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, they're just constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> order linear homogeneous because they = <EXPRESSION> differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you'll see that these, in some ways, are the most fun differential equations to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, often the most useful because in a lot of the applications of classical mechanics, this is all you need to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But they're the most fun to solve because they all boil down to Algebra II problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll touch on that in a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just think about this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Think about what the properties of these solutions might be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just throw out something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that <EXPRESSION> is a solution.", "entities": [{"id": 10290, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So that means that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "These mean the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, my question to you is, what if I have some constant times <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that still a solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So my question is, let's say some constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is this a solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's try it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see whether this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could factor out that <EXPRESSION> constant, and we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10307, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And lo and behold, we already know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we know that <EXPRESSION> is a solution, we know that this is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10315, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "Or another way to view it is that if <EXPRESSION> is a solution to this <EXPRESSION> order linear homogeneous differential equation, then some constant times <EXPRESSION> is also a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is also a solution to the differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the next property I want to show you and this is all going someplace, don't worry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next question I want to ask you is, OK, we know that <EXPRESSION> is a solution to the differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if I were to also tell you that <EXPRESSION> is also a solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So my question to you is, is <EXPRESSION> a solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll have <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of this thing.", "entities": [{"id": 10329, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "Well, that's straightforward enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just <EXPRESSION> the <EXPRESSION> derivative of this thing <EXPRESSION> times this function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what can we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's distribute all of these constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10342, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 10343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 94}, {"id": 10344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "And now we can rearrange them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've shown that this whole expression = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is a solution of the differential equation of this <EXPRESSION> order linear homogeneous differential equation and <EXPRESSION> is also a solution, then if you were to add them together, the sum of them is also a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in general, if we show that <EXPRESSION> is a solution and <EXPRESSION> is a solution, you can add them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we showed before that any constant times them is also a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe the constant in <EXPRESSION> of the cases is <EXPRESSION> or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, these are useful properties to maybe internalize for <EXPRESSION> order homogeneous linear differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the next video, we're actually going to apply these properties to figure out the solutions for these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll see that they're actually straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would say a lot easier than what we did in the previous <EXPRESSION> order homogeneous difference equations, or the exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is much, much easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today, I'm going to continue the idea of setting up integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we'll deal with is volumes by slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By slicing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's lucky that this is after lunch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's after breakfast for some of you, because there's the typical way of introducing this subject is with a food analogy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a lot of ways of slicing up food.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll give a few more examples than just this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, suppose you have, well, suppose you have a loaf of bread here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our loaf of bread, and I hope that looks a little bit like a loaf of bread.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's supposed to be sitting on the kitchen counter ready to be eaten.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to figure out how much bread there is there, <EXPRESSION> way of doing it is to cut it into slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you probably know that bread is often sliced like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are even machines to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And with this setup here, I'll draw the slice with a little bit of a more colorful decoration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our red slice of bread.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's coming around like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it comes back down behind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our bread slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'd like to figure out is its volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the only other dimension that I'm going to give, because this is a very qualitative analysis for now, is what I'll call the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the area on the face of the slice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the limit, that's going to be something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe the areas of the slices vary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There might be a little hole in the middle of the bread somewhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it might change as <EXPRESSION> changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the whole volume you get by adding up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you should think of it in a sort of intuitive way as being analogous to the Riemann sum, where you would take each slice individually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that would look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so that's just a superficial and intuitive way of looking at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's already on your problem set, you had an example of a slice of some region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're only going to talk systematically about something called solids of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea here is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose you have some shape, some graph, which maybe looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to revolve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, I'm going to revolve it around the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I can draw it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's maybe a football.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you had made this copy underneath, it still would have been the same region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we only pay attention to what's above the axis here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the basic idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to apply the method of slices to figure out the volume of such regions and give you a general formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then apply it in a specific case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're very hard to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's hard to visualize with them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're only going to deal with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since it's much harder to draw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it starts out being more or less like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then we're going to sweep it around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Swing around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that traces out something over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I'm going to draw this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It traces out a disk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's hard for me to draw, and I'm not going to try too hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I drew it more like a wheel, looking like a wheel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, it's this little flat disk here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the method that I'm describing for figuring out the volume is called the method of disks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be our <EXPRESSION> method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm going to apply the reasoning that I have up on the previous blackboard here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I need to get the volume of this chunk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way I'm going to get the volume of this chunk is by figuring out its thickness and its area, its cross-sectional area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's not too difficult to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this height, so this height is what we usually call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is usually a <EXPRESSION>, it's varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this particular distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the area of the face is easy to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's a circle, or a disk if you like, with this radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So its area is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's, if you like, <EXPRESSION> of the dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the thickness is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the incremental volume is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the method of disks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the integrand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are more peculiar things about this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that I'm integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I haven't yet told you what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that will depend on what <EQUATION> I use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we're actually going to calculate something, we're going to have to figure that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's another very important point which is that in order to get a definite integral, something I haven't mentioned, we're going to have to figure out where we're starting and we're ending the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's deal with an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll switch over from a football to a soccer ball.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take a circle, and we'll say it has radius <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm putting it in this particular spot for a reason.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can do this in lots of different ways, but I'm picking this <EXPRESSION> to make a certain exercise on your homework easier for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I'm doing half of it for you right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Appreciate it, yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm sure especially today it's appreciated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, the formula has to do with keeping track of these slices here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're sweeping things around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what our goal is, to figure out what the volume of the ball of radius <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, again as I say, the thing sweeps around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the setup is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's our formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we need to figure out what's going on with that formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to do that, what we're going to do is just write down the equation for the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there's <EXPRESSION> nice thing, which is that we really didn't need it to find the formula for <EXPRESSION>, we only needed to find the formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take a square root, that's nice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 10423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "These <EXPRESSION> terms cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 10425, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "And so the formula here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright now, that is what's known as the integrand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, except for this factor of <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the answer for the volume is going to be the integral of <EXPRESSION> times this integrand, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just the same thing as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now there's also the issue of the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is a completely separate problem, which we also have to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The range of <EXPRESSION> is, from this leftmost point to the rightmost point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> varies, starts at <EXPRESSION>, and it goes all the way up to what, what's the top value here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now I have a completely specified integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, and this was the theme last time, the whole goal is to get ourselves to a complete formula for something with an integrand and limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll be able to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we have clear sailing to the end of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just finish it off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the thing whose derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that = <EXPRESSION> times, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so all told, that is, let's see, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is maybe a familiar formula, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it worked, we got it right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just point out a couple of other things about this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is that from this point of view, we've actually accomplished more then just finding the volume of the ball.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've also found the volume of a bunch of intermediate regions, which I can draw schematically this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've got something which is actually a lot more information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For instance, if you plug in <EQUATION>, not surprisingly, and this is a good idea to do because it checks that we've actually got a correct formula here.", "entities": [{"id": 10449, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So if you like you can call this a double-check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you check <EXPRESSION>, this should be the volume of a half-ball.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's halfway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I go over here and I only go up to <EXPRESSION>, that's exactly half of the ball.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That had better be half, so let's just see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in this case is <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that turns out to be <EXPRESSION> times a total of <EXPRESSION>, which is indeed half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, on your problem set, what you're going to want to look at is this full formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of this chunk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what it's going to be good for is a real-life problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, a problem that really came up over the summer, and this fall, at a couple of universities near here, where people were trying to figure out a phenomenon which is well-known.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if you have a bunch of particles in a fluid, and maybe the size of these things is <EXPRESSION> micron.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have a bunch of other little particles, which are a lot smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then what happens is that the particles, the big particles, like to hug each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They like to clump together, they're very nice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Friendly characters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the explanation for this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The explanation is that actually they are not quite as friendly as they might seem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's really happening is that the little guys are shoving them around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And pushing them together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they have sharp elbows, the little ones and they're pushing them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't like them to be around and they're pushing them together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's actually another possibility.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that they also will stick to the sides of the container.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you want to get a quantitative handle on how much of this happens, it has to do with how much space these things take up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the issue is some kind of overlap between a band around <EXPRESSION> sphere and a band around the other sphere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this overlap region is what you have to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to calculate what's in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can do that using this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not even difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you're on your way to figuring out this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the question is, which do they prefer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do they prefer to touch each other, or do they prefer to touch the wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do they all cluster to the wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can actually see this in solutions, what they do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a real, live problem, which really comes up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Came up just this year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And frequently comes up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For solids of revolution, which is called the method of disks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I need to tell you about the other standard method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is called the method of shells.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is supposed to be a witches' cauldron.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops, witch, witches, well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's this shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to figure out how much liquid is in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to plot this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll put this down just a bit lower here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to make it a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to make the top height be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's my situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to figure out how much liquid is in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason why I presented the problem in this form, of course, is really to get you used to these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you spin the parabola around, you get this kind of shape, this kind of solid shape here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to use the same kind of slicing that I did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's going to look totally different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I'll draw it in red again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take a little slice over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to imagine what happens if it gets revolved around the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This time it's not a disk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, if I revolve this around the other way, it would have had a hole in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is also possible to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's practically the same as the method of disks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll maybe discuss that in recitation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, we're going to revolve it around this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, I need to sweep it around, swing it around like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll draw the shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to sweep around in a circle and maybe it'll have a little bit of thickness to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the thing that people call a shell.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the so-called shell of the method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would maybe call it a cylinder, and another way of thinking about it is that you can maybe wrap up a piece of paper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There it is, there's a cylinder you can see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very thin, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very thin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason why I used the piece of paper as an example of this is that I'm going to have to figure out the volume of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its thickness, as usual, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its height is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, actually I have to use the diagram to see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, again this is an incredibly risky thing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in disguise, when I call this <EXPRESSION>, I mean <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the interesting curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't mean <EQUATION>, which is the other part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In general, you might think of it as being = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are, of course, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>'s involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In disguise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last bit that I have to do, I claim, in order to figure this out, is the circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason for that is that if I think of this thing as like this tube, or piece of paper here, in order to figure out how much stuff there is here, all I have to do is unfold it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its size, the whole quantity of paper here is the same whether it's rolled up like this or whether it's stretched out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I unwrap it, it looks like what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it looks like kind of a slab?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, it looks like just a slab like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, the thickness is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The height is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can see that the length here is all the way around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be the circumference when I unwrap it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to figure out the circumference, I need to figure out the radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the radius is, on this diagram, is right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this length here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this circumference is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this height is still ay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the thickness is still <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in total, we're just going to multiply these numbers together to get the total volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have, in other words, <EXPRESSION> = the product of the <EXPRESSION> dimension dimension, the <EXPRESSION> dimension, and the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Incidentally, dimensional analysis is very useful and important in these problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see that there are <EXPRESSION> lengths being multiplied together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll get a volume in end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something cubic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will be coming back to that, because it's a quite subtle issue sometimes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the formula, and let's simplify it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I rewrite that as <EXPRESSION> (<EXPRESSION>, whoops, <EXPRESSION>) <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Better not get that wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the last little bit here, that I had better be careful about in order to figure out what the total volume is, is the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the volume is going to be the integral of this quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have to pay attention to what the limits are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, here you have to be careful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I went to it immediately, but that's the whole point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that everything gets read off from this diagram here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you take this guy and you sweep it around, you take care of everything that's to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we only have to count what's to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't have to count anything over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's taken care of when we sweep around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's where we start.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And where we end is the farthest, rightmost spot for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've got to watch out about where that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the <EXPRESSION> variable, it's up at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in the <EXPRESSION> variable, we can see that it's what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these limits, this is where you're going to focus all your attention on the integrand and getting it just right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you're going to lose your steam and not pay attention to the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're equally important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've no hope of getting the right answer without getting the limits right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, that's just because <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> implies <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's that upper limit there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, we're ready to carry out this, to evaluate this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get <EXPRESSION> sorry, we get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll leave the <EXPRESSION>'s in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, let's see, what is that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is a total of <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, why did I integrate only from the middle to this end, instead of all the way from over here, <EXPRESSION>, all the way to the plus end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is that you have to look at what's happening with the rotation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This red guy, when I swept it around, I counted the stuff to the right and the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, if I just rotate the right half of this, I'm covering the left half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I counted the stuff from <EXPRESSION>, I would be doing it twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would be doubling what I need.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way of saying it is if I wanted to take the whole region, if I rotate it around only <EXPRESSION> degrees, only <EXPRESSION>, that would fill up the whole region, if I did both halves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then instead of a circumference, instead of a <EXPRESSION>, I could use a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then I would have double what I had.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are <EXPRESSION> ways of looking at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same goes, actually, for the football case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I have that football, I didn't count the bottom part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ooh, good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, when do you know, how do you know when to take the rectangle to be vertical or horizontal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far we've only done vertical rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to do a horizontal example in a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer to the question of when you do it is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can always set it up both ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> way may be a difficult calculation and <EXPRESSION> way may be an easier calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yesterday, we did it - or, sorry, the last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, I guess it was yesterday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did it with and the horizontal and the vertical were quite different in character.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So very often, <EXPRESSION> will be easier than the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the difference in difficulty can be extreme.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you don't know that in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, did we just find the volume when you rotate this green region around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, did we find the volume when we rotate this whole region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, just the right half or the right and the left half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is both.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The region that you get is the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You always get this cauldron, whether you take this right half when you rotate it around or you take both and you rotate it around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer to both of those questions is the same and it's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that if you rotated them both around and you only wanted to cover things once, you would rotate halfway around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you can rotate around as many times as you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're still covering the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over and over and over and over again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a very subtle point that I need to discuss with you in order to go on to the next application.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's my, and I do want to get to the point of horizontal cross-sections as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's continue here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's something a little fishy in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it can be summarized in the character of the answer, which is just a little bit not clear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know that a is in units and we should've gotten cubic units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's something a little bit tricky about this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I want to illustrate the paradox right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, suppose that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And suppose the units are centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the formula for the volume is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the units we must take are centimeters cubed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Despite the fact that you kind of want to square the centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's not what this problem says.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this is the situation that we've got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you work out what this is, to figure out what the volume of this cauldron is, what you find is that it's <EXPRESSION>, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And those are otherwise known as liters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is approximately <EXPRESSION> liters, which is about <EXPRESSION> liters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's how much was in the cauldron under this choice of units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to make another choice of units now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to make a comparison.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the formula tells us to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a paradox.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a serious paradox.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you really want to apply problems, you actually have to understand what your answers mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do you think is going on here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, how could either of these make sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How am I dealing with the units in either case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm going to explain to you the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is really quite puzzling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it has a resolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer to this question is that both answers are correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is correct reasoning in both cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the matter is that you have to interpret the equation <EQUATION> in <EXPRESSION> different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me explain what they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For instance, you can take <EQUATION> in centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this distance here, which is the <EXPRESSION> value, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what the relationship means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the top of the cauldron, if you like, this distance here is <EXPRESSION> centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually very badly drawn to scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually very, very, deep, this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a rather skinny, deep <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is very much not to scale, this picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other picture, the other picture is interpreting <EQUATION> in meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's more like what I had in mind, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I had in mind this big vat here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this distance here is <EXPRESSION> meter, and then the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this distance here is also <EXPRESSION> meter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the top is <EXPRESSION> meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it's not that crazy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact it's easy to check that, it's pretty reasonable in terms of scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That this thing has <EXPRESSION> liters in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this guy has <EXPRESSION> liters in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you actually have to know what your symbols mean when you're dealing with these kinds of applied problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you're ever really going to do some real consequences, you have to know what the units mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the problem with the equation <EQUATION> is that it's the <EXPRESSION> that violated scaling rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the question is whether the formula <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the correct answer to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it is not consistent in units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're all inconsistent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, this formula violates scaling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you study each step correctly, you will discover that these are the consistent and correct statements, what I'm writing on the blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this makes sense in a unit-less sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a mistake to think of this as being 1 meter and cubing the meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will be an error that will cause you problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I encourage you to study this on your own.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm going to introduce the next problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll have to solve it next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the reason why I spent all the time on units is that otherwise it would be impossible for you to believe me when I do this next calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we're trying to get a real answer out of a real question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to make conversions between centimeters and meters back and forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have to get it consistent in order to have the right answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there was a reason for illustrating this pitfall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is definitely seasonally appropriate, since we're approaching Halloween.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll work it out fully next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to introduce another feature into the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll set it all up tomorrow, but right now I need you to understand what the new main idea that we're going to get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is the new physical feature that I'm going to add to this problem is that if when you're boiling, when the witches are boiling this water, the temperature of the water is not the same at each level in the kettle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the bottom of the kettle, where you're heating it up, it's at its highest temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, it's going to be totally boiling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> degrees Celsius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, it's very cold outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it's <EXPRESSION> degrees outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the temperature at which all witches operate, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, so they're boiling their stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the question that we're going to ask is how much heat, how much heat, do they need to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to heat it up to this temperature configuration here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's rising from <EXPRESSION> down here to <EXPRESSION> up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the temperature is varying in height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for simplicity I'm going to make the formula for the temperature be <EXPRESSION> at the top and <EXPRESSION> at the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the situation that we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the point about this problem is we're going to figure out the total temperature, the total amount of heat that you need to add in order to heat this thing up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be temperature times volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But some places will count more than others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These will be hotter, but there's less water down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is wider up here, so there's more water up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are various things that are varying in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the only way to set up so that it works is to chop things up horizontally instead of vertically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's on the horizontal levels that the temperature is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll have an easy calculation for how much it takes to heat up a layer, a horizontal layer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we rotate this guy around the y axis, that is which kind of shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a disk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually this <EXPRESSION>'s going to be an easier problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be a disk problem, not a shell problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're going to have to work things out with respect to the dy variation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the integral will be with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we will do that next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll figure out how much heat it takes to boil the kettle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I filled your brain with a bunch of partial derivatives and <EXPRESSION>'s, with respect to <EXPRESSION>'s and <EXPRESSION>'s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think now it's time to actually do it with a real differential equation, and make things a little bit more concrete.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I have the differential, <EXPRESSION>, the differential equation, <EXPRESSION>, plus I'm already running out of space <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10616, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 10617, "label": "command", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "Well, your brain is already, hopefully, in exact differential equations mode.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you were to see this pattern in general, where you see a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, here this is just some <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and then you have another <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, your brain should immediately say if this is inseparable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm not going to try to make it separable, just because that'll take a lot of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if it's not separable, your brain said, oh, maybe this is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you say, let me test whether this is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is an exact equation, this is our <EXPRESSION>, which is a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is our <EXPRESSION>, which is a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the test is to see if the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = let's see, <EXPRESSION> is so this <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, so it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> plus now, what's the derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's just <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the constant on the outside, <EXPRESSION> times the derivative, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is the partial derivative of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, or the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION> so what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's easy, that's <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, because <EXPRESSION> is constant when we're taking the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of a constant, with respect to anything is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>, which, lo and behold, is the same thing as the derivative, the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, given that this is an exact equation oh, my wife snuck up behind me, I was wondering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I thought there was some critter in my house, or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, so we know that this is an exact equation, so what does that tell us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that tells us that there's some <EXPRESSION>, where the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>, and the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we know that <EXPRESSION>, then we can rewrite our differential equation as the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10688, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "So let's solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could write that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could have done it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could have said the partial of <EXPRESSION> the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this thing over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just do it with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just write that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And normally when you integrate with respect to <EXPRESSION>, you'd say, OK, <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you take the antiderivative, you were, like, oh well, there might have been some <EXPRESSION> here that we lost when we took the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be = the integral, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, or the antiderivative, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, here, plus some <EXPRESSION> that we might have lost when we took the partial, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10727, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 10728, "label": "command", "start_offset": 133, "end_offset": 137}]}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's figure out this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it in blue So <EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the antiderivative of<EXPRESSION>, is just <EXPRESSION>, plus either the <EXPRESSION> is constant, so <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10734, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "The antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you want to verify this, you should take the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10741, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 47}, {"id": 10742, "label": "method", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "OK, so we're almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've almost figured out our <EXPRESSION>, but we still need to figure out this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know that if we take the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, since this is an exact equation, we should get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We should get our <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial I'll switch notation, just to expose you to it the partial <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is going to be = so here, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": [{"id": 10755, "label": "command", "start_offset": 121, "end_offset": 132}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, so the derivative of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's just <EXPRESSION>, plus what's the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 10765, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10768, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Well, what did we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We took <EXPRESSION>, we integrated with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we said, well, we might have lost some function of <EXPRESSION>, so we added that to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we took the partial of that side that we've almost constructed, and we took the partial of that, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our <EXPRESSION> is up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh no, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION> is up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> let me write that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10781, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was just our <EXPRESSION>, from our original differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see, we can delete <EXPRESSION> from both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 10787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 10788, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "We can delete <EXPRESSION> from both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 10790, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 10791, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "And then what are we left with?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're left with <EXPRESSION> = well, it = <EXPRESSION> plus some constant, <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 10796, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "So what is our <EXPRESSION> now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We wrote our <EXPRESSION> up here, and we had this <EXPRESSION> here, so we can rewrite it now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> we're actually pretty much almost done solving it <EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION> oh, sorry, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10810, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So we've solved for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what does that tell us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if you were to integrate both sides of this, you would get that <EQUATION> is a solution of that differential equation.", "entities": [{"id": 10817, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 10818, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "So if we were to set this is = <EXPRESSION>, that's the differential equation.", "entities": [{"id": 10820, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So we could say, <EXPRESSION> now we could say, plus this <EXPRESSION> plus this <EXPRESSION>, you call it <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10825, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 10826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}, {"id": 10828, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 52}, {"id": 10829, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "Well, you could subtract the <EXPRESSION>'s from both sides, and just be left with a <EXPRESSION> at the end.", "entities": [{"id": 10832, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 24}, {"id": 10834, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "But anyway, we have solved this exact equation, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, by recognizing it was exact, by taking the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and seeing if that was = the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once we saw that they were =, we're like, OK, this is going to be exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's figure out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since this is exact, <EXPRESSION> is going to be the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then to figure out <EXPRESSION>, we integrated <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we got this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To figure out the function of <EXPRESSION>, we then took our <EXPRESSION> that we figured out, took the partial of that, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, got this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we had our final <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our final <EXPRESSION> was this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the differential equation, because of the chain rule of partial derivatives, we could rewrite the differential equation as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solution is this, and so this is the solution to our differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the rest of the term, we are going to be studying not just <EXPRESSION> differential equation at a time, but rather what are called systems of differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are like systems of linear equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They have to be solved simultaneously, in other words, not just <EXPRESSION> at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how does a system look when you write it down?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, since we are going to be talking about systems of ordinary differential equations, there still will be only <EXPRESSION> independent variable, but there will be several dependent variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to call, let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10863, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "The dependent variables are going to be, I will call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and then the <EXPRESSION> order system, something involving just <EXPRESSION> derivatives, will look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the left-hand side will be <EXPRESSION>, in other words.", "entities": [{"id": 10869, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 29}, {"id": 10870, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "On the right-hand side will be the dependent variables and then also the independent variables.", "entities": [{"id": 10871, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "I will indicate that, I will separate it all from the others by putting a semicolon there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same way <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, will be some other function of (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>) and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what they depend upon is the independent variable <EXPRESSION>, time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there is still more terminology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, practically all the equations after the term started, virtually all the equations we have been considering are linear equations, so it must be true that linear systems are the best kind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, boy, they certainly are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When are we going to call a system linear?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think in the beginning you should learn a little terminology before we launch in and actually try to start to solve these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the dependent variables must occur linearly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it must look like this, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But even the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are allowed to be functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They could be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to distinguish those cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The case where <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are constants, that I will call Well, there are different things you can call it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will simply call it a constant coefficient system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A system with coefficients would probably be better English.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, this system will still be called linear if these are functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can also be functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be a perfectly good linear system to have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would never see something like that but it is okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What else do you need to know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what would a homogenous system be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "A homogenous system is <EXPRESSION> without these extra guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That doesn't mean there is no <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a linear homogenous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is the kind we are going to start studying <EXPRESSION> in the same way when we studied higher order equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So linear homogenous means that <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> for all time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are identically <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are not there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't see them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have I left anything out?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, the initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since that is quite general, let's talk about what would initial conditions look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in a general way, the reason you have to have initial conditions is to get values for the arbitrary constants that appear in the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, how many arbitrary constants are going to appear in the solutions of these equations?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I will just give you the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The number of arbitrary constants that appear is the total order of the system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, if this were a <EXPRESSION> derivative and this were a <EXPRESSION> derivative, I would expect <EXPRESSION> arbitrary constants in the system because the total, the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you must have as many initial conditions as you have arbitrary constants in the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I had to specify the initial starting point and the initial velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same thing happens here but the answer is it is more natural, the conditions here are more natural.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have to specify the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why not?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, because an initial condition, of course, would want me to say what the starting value of <EXPRESSION> is, some number, and it will also want to know what the starting value of <EXPRESSION> is at that same point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since this is going to have <EXPRESSION> arbitrary constants in it, it is these initial conditions that will satisfy, the arbitrary constants will have to be picked so as to satisfy those initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't have to be the least bit cleaver about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, there are other kinds of conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I cannot think of any more general terminology, so it sounds like we are going to actually have to get to work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's get to work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to set up a system and solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since <EXPRESSION> of the things in this course is supposed to be simple modeling, it should be a system that models something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Mixing, radioactive decay, temperature, the motion of temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Heat, heat conduction, in other words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Diffusion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have given you a diffusion problem for your <EXPRESSION> homework on this subject.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What else did we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all I can think of for the moment, but I am sure they will occur to me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When, out of those physical ideas, are we going to get a system?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say you want to have a big tank and a little tank here and you want to put some stuff into the little tank so that it will get mixed in the big tank without having to climb a big ladder and stop and drop the stuff in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, to give something closer to home, closer to this backboard, anyway, suppose you have dah, dah, dah, don't groan, at least not audibly, something that looks like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And next to it put an <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But suppose it is a <EXPRESSION> loop circuit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I need a pair of equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Each of these loops gives a <EXPRESSION> order differential equation, but they have to be solved simultaneously to find the current or the charges on the condensers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I want a system of <EXPRESSION> equations, throw in another loop.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, suppose I put in a coil instead.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is this going to lead to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to give me a system of <EXPRESSION> equations of which this will be <EXPRESSION> order, <EXPRESSION> order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this will be <EXPRESSION> order because it has a coil.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You are up to that, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've had coils, inductance?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To find out how complicated it is, you have to add up the orders.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to return to a problem we considered earlier in the problem of heat conduction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I had forgotten whether it was on the problem set or I did it in class, but I am choosing it because it leads to something we will be able to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And because it illustrates how to add a little sophistication to something that was unsophisticated before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A pot of water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "External temperature <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am talking about the temperature of something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I am talking about the temperature of will be an egg that is cooking inside, but with a difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This egg is not homogenous inside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead it has a white and it has a yolk in the middle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it is a real egg and not a phony egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is a small pot, or it is an ostrich egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] That is the yoke.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The yolk is contained in a little membrane inside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are little yucky things that hold it in position.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the temperature of the yolk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, that's the water bath.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is liquid, at the beginning at any rate, but it certainly has different constants of conductivity than the egg white would.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the condition of heat through the shell of the egg would be different from the conduction of heat through the membrane that keeps the yoke together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it is quite reasonable to consider that the white and the yolk will be at different temperatures and will have different conductivity properties.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to use Newton's laws but with this further refinement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, introducing <EXPRESSION> temperatures.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's use Newton's law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the yolk is getting all its heat from the white.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is going to be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 10988, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Here I have a system of equations because I want to make <EXPRESSION> dependent variables by refining the original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you always have to write a system in standard form to solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, the temperature of the yolk and then the temperature of the white.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that, for example, what might be some possibilities, well, suppose the problem was I wanted to coddle the egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think there is a generation gap here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How many of you know what a coddled egg is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How many of you don't know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm just saying my daughter didn't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mentioned it to her.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said I think I'm going to do a coddled egg tomorrow in class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And she said what is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I said a cuddled egg?", "entities": []}
{"text": "She said why would someone cuddle an egg?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said coddle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And she said, oh, you mean like a person, like what you do to somebody you like or don't like or I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I thought a while and said, yeah, more like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is why people do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You heat up the water to boiling, the egg should be at room temperature, and then you carefully lower the egg into the water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you turn off the heat so the water bath cools exponentially while the egg inside is rising in temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have a perfect egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for coddling, spelled so, what will the external temperature be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason you have it boiling is for calibration so that you can know what temperature it is without having to use a thermometer, unless you're on Pike's Peak or some place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It starts out at <EXPRESSION> degrees.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And after that, since the light is off, it cools exponential because that is another law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, you will then be able to solve these equations and know how the temperature rises.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to solve a different problem because I don't want to have to deal with this inhomogeneous term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's use, as a different problem, a person cooks an egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not just to cool it but also because I think it prevents that dark thing from forming that looks sort of unattractive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's ice bath.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only reason for dropping the egg into an ice bath is so that you could have a homogenous equation to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, all my work in preparing this example, and it took considerably longer time than actually solving the problem, was in picking values for a and b which would make everything come out nice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's harder than it looks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The values that we are going to use, which make no physical sense whatsoever, but <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are called nice numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the system?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can somebody read it off for me?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION> =, what is it, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is, what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, on Wednesday I will teach you a fancy way of solving this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, to be honest, the fancy way will take roughly about as long as the way I am going to do it now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The main reason for doing it is that it introduces new vocabulary which everyone wants you to have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also, more important reasons, it gives more insight into the solution than this method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This method just produces the answer, but you want insight, also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is just as important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for now, let's use a method which always works and which in 40 years, after you have forgotten all other fancy methods, will still be available to you because it is method you can figure out yourself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't have to remember anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The method is to eliminate <EXPRESSION> of the dependent variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is just the way you solve systems of linear equations in general if you aren't doing something fancy with determinants and matrices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you just eliminate variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are going to eliminate <EXPRESSION> of these variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's eliminate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11026, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "You could also eliminate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11028, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "How do I eliminate <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Beg your pardon?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is something wrong?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If somebody thinks something is wrong raise his hand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do I want to get rid of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I can add them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What good is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11037, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "Wherever you see a <EXPRESSION>, put that in, and what you will be left with is something just in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To be honest, I don't know any other good way of doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is a fancy method that I think is talked about in your book, which leads to extraneous solutions and so on, but you don't want to know about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will work for a simple linear equation with constant coefficients, always.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Substitute in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, here I do not advise doing this mentally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is just too easy to make a mistake.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, I will do it carefully, writing everything out just as you would.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I took that and substituted into this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I don't like those <EXPRESSION>'s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's get rid of them by multiplying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will become <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11044, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And now write this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is this when you look at it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an equation just in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has constant coefficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is its order?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its order is <EXPRESSION> because <EXPRESSION> primed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, I can eliminate <EXPRESSION> okay, but the equation I am going to get is no longer a <EXPRESSION>-order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's a basic law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Even if you have a system of more equations, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or whatever, the law is that after you do the elimination successfully and end up with a single equation, normally the order of that equation will be the sum of the orders of the things you started with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is like all mathematical problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You say, oh, I didn't save anything after all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the law of conservation of mathematical difficulty.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the beginning it looks great, you've got these tables, take the equation, horrible to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take some transform, trivial to solve for capital <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I have to find the inverse Laplace transform.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And suddenly all the work is there, partial fractions, funny formulas and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is very hard in mathematics to get away with something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens now and then and everybody cheers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write this out now in the form in which it looks like an equation we can actually solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just be careful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now it is all right to use the method by which you collect terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is only <EXPRESSION> term involving <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the <EXPRESSION> that comes from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about the terms in <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, there is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I put it on the other side it makes <EXPRESSION> this <EXPRESSION> makes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how many <EXPRESSION>'s are there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, none on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> put on this left-hand side the way we want to do makes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are no inhomogeneous terms, so that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I had gotten a negative number for <EXPRESSION> of these coefficients, I would instantly know if I had made a mistake.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why must those numbers come out to be positive?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is because the system must be, the system must be, fill in with <EXPRESSION> word, stable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why must this system be stable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the long-term solutions must be <EXPRESSION>, must all go to <EXPRESSION>, whatever they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, because you are putting the egg into an ice bath.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, because we know it was living but after being hardboiled it is dead and, therefore, dead systems are stable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, therefore, the differential equation must have the same property, and that means that its coefficients must be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All its coefficients must be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this weren't there, I would get oscillating solutions, which wouldn't go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is physical impossible for this egg.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the rest is just solving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The characteristic equation, if you can remember way, way back in prehistoric times when we were solving these equations, is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what you want to do is factor it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is where all the work was, getting those numbers so that this would factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> And so the solutions are, the roots are <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am just making marks on the board, but you have done this often enough, you know what I am talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the characteristic roots are those <EXPRESSION> numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, therefore, the solution is, I could write down immediately with its arbitrary constant as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I have got to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here the <EXPRESSION> worry is <EXPRESSION> is going to give me <EXPRESSION> more arbitrary constants.", "entities": [{"id": 11095, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "It better not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The system is only allowed to have <EXPRESSION> arbitrary constants in its solution because that is the initial conditions we are giving it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, I forgot to give initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's give initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Realistic numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the thing not to do is to say, hey, I found <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, I will find <EXPRESSION> by the same procedure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will go through the whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will eliminate <EXPRESSION> instead.", "entities": [{"id": 11104, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And that is no good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the correct solution only has <EXPRESSION> constants in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that procedure is wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the <EXPRESSION> we have to have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where is the chalk?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I can have a little thing so I can just carry this around with me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the relation between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you don't like it, either <EXPRESSION> of these equations will express <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION> for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whichever <EXPRESSION> you use, however you do it, that's the way you must calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The coefficient is <EXPRESSION>, take <EXPRESSION> of that, that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11134, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Take half of that, <EXPRESSION> and add this <EXPRESSION> to it, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11139, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 11140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice it uses the same arbitrary constants that <EXPRESSION> uses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we end up with just <EXPRESSION> because we calculated <EXPRESSION> from that formula or from the equation which is equivalent to it, not from scratch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't put in the initial conditions yet, but that is easy to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everybody, when working with exponentials, of course, you always want the initial conditions to be when <EQUATION> because that makes all the exponentials <EXPRESSION> and you don't have to worry about them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> should be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11152, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "Now we are supposed to solve these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is called solving simultaneous linear equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could use Kramer's rule, inverse matrices, but why don't we just eliminate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I multiply by, <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "And if <EQUATION>, then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, that's right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives the answer to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells you, in other words, how the temperature of the yolk varies with time and how the temperature of the white varies with time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As I said, we are going to learn a slick way of doing this problem, or at least a very different way of doing the same problem next time, but let's put that on ice for the moment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And instead I would like to spend the rest of the period doing for <EXPRESSION> order systems the same thing that I did for you the very <EXPRESSION> day of the term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we spent a little while working on such problems because nowadays with computers it is really important that you get a feeling for what these things mean as opposed to just algorithms for solving them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As I say, most differential equations, especially systems, are likely to be solved by a computer anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to be the guiding genius that interprets the answers and can see when mistakes are being made, stuff like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The problem is, therefore, what is the meaning of this system?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I don't know what to do if it does up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a word for these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just curious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Autonomous, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an autonomous system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is not a linear system because these are messy functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This could be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be a mess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Definitely not linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> means the independent variable appears on the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, it is there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is buried in the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it is not on the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's see, what does a solution look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I never even talked about what a solution was, did I?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, pretend that immediately after I talked about that, I talked about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the solution, maybe you took it for granted, is a pair of functions, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> if when you plug it in it satisfies the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what else is new?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solution is <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I draw a picture of that what would it look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do you draw a picture of that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does it represent?", "entities": []}
{"text": "A curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what will be the title of the chapter of the calculus book in which that is discussed?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Parametric equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a parameterized curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know what the solution looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our solution is a parameterized curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what does a parameterized curve look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it travels, and in a certain direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do I have several of those curves?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, because I have several solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, given any initial starting point, there is a solution that goes through it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will put in possible starting points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can do this on the computer screen with a little program you will have, <EXPRESSION> of the visuals you'll have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's being made right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put down starter point, put down a click, and then it just draws the curve passing through that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Didn't we do this early in the term?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there is a difference now which I will explain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are various possible starting points at time <EXPRESSION> for this solution, and then you see what happens to it afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, through every point in the plane will pass a solution curve, parameterized curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is then the representation of this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is the meaning of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am not going to worry for the moment about the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does this mean by itself?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is the curve, the parameterized motion, then this represents its velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is the velocity of the solution at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I think of the solution as being a parameterized motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I have drawn here is the trace, the path of the motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This hasn't indicated how fast it was going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is a velocity, and that velocity changes from point to point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It changes direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know its direction at each point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I cannot tell is the speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From this picture, I cannot tell what the speed was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Too bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is then the meaning of the system?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What the system does, it prescribes at each point the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at each point there is a certain vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The vector is always tangent to the solution curve through there, but I cannot predict from just this picture what its length will be because at some points, it might be going slow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solution might be going slowly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the plane is filled up with these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Stop me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not enough here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So on and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A field of velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The plane covered with velocity vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a solution is a parameterized curve with the right velocity everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there obviously must be a connection between that and the direction fields we studied at the beginning of the term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is a very important connection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we need it, I will have to spend some time talking about it then.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The topic for today is how to change variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're talking about substitutions and differential equations, or changing variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the sad fact is that in some sense, those are the only <EXPRESSION> general methods there are, that those are the only <EXPRESSION> kinds of equations that can always be solved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what about all the others?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, ultimately, as you will see, the way the equations are solved is by changing them into a linear equation, or an equation where the variables are separable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, that's for a few minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's the most common kind there is, and you've already had it in physics class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, scaling simply means to change the coordinates, in effect, or axes, to change the coordinates on the axes to scale the axes, to either stretch them or contract them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what does the change of variable actually look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the new variable <EXPRESSION> is related to the old <EXPRESSION> by an equation of that form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> are constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, those are the equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why does <EXPRESSION> do this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, for a lot of reasons.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, maybe we can list them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You, for example, could be changing units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a common reason in physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Changing the units that he used, you would have to make a change of coordinates of this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Perhaps the even more important reason is to, sometimes it's used to make the variables dimensionless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, so that the variables become pure numbers, with no units attached to them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since you are well aware of the tortures involved in dealing with units in physics, the point of making variables, I'm sorry, dimensionless, I don't have to sell that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Dimensionless, i.e. no units, without any units attached.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Reduce their number is self explanatory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Simplify means make them less, either dimensionless also, or if you can't do that, at least less dependent upon the critical units than the old ones were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give you a very simple example which will illustrate most of these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a version of the cooling law, which applies at very high temperatures, and it runs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is the external constant, which I'll assume, now, is a constant external temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is valid if big temperature differences, Newton's Law, breaks down and <EXPRESSION> needs a different <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you are free to solve that equation just as it stands, if you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are difficulties connected with it because you're dealing with the <EXPRESSION> powers, of course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, before you do that, <EXPRESSION> should scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How should I scale?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that is very likely to use is <EQUATION> divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11254, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "And therefore, by taking the ratio of the <EXPRESSION>, there are no units attached to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is dimensionless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, how actually do I change the variable in the equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, watch this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an utterly trivial idea, and utterly important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't slog around doing it this way, trying to stuff it in, and divide <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11259, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "Instead, do the inverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, write it instead as <EQUATION>, the reason being that it's <EXPRESSION> that's facing you in that equation, and therefore <EXPRESSION> you want to substitute for.", "entities": [{"id": 11263, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "So, let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The new equation will be what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> Since this is a constant, the left-hand side becomes <EQUATION>, so I'm going to factor out that <EXPRESSION>, and make it <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "entities": [{"id": 11269, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 63}, {"id": 11270, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "Now, I could divide through by <EXPRESSION> and get rid of <EXPRESSION> of those, and so, the new equation, now, is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, = Now, I have <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> cubed out front here.", "entities": [{"id": 11277, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "I'm going to just give that a new name, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Essentially, it's the same equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's no harder to solve and no easier to solve than the original <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's been simplified.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For <EXPRESSION>, I think it looks better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to compare the <EXPRESSION>, I'll put this <EXPRESSION> up in green, and this <EXPRESSION> in green, too, just to convince you it's the same, but indicate that it's the same equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice, so, <EXPRESSION> has been rendered, is now dimensionless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I don't have to even ask when I solve this equation, oh, please tell me what the units of temperature are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How you are measuring temperature makes no difference to this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> still has units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What units does it have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's been simplified because it now has the units of, since this is dimensionless and this is dimensionless, it has the units of inverse time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, moreover, there's <EXPRESSION> less constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> less constant in the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just looks better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This business, I think you know that <EXPRESSION>, the process of forming <EXPRESSION> out of <EXPRESSION> is called lumping constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think they use standard terminology in physics and engineering courses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Try to get all the constants together like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you lump them there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are lumped for you, and then you just give the lump a new name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's an example of scaling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Watch out for when you can use that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's now go to serious stuff, where we are actually going to make changes of variables which we hope will render unsolvable equations suddenly solvable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to do that by making substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's, I think, quite important to watch up there are <EXPRESSION> kinds of substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are direct substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's where you introduce a new variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know how to write this on the board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just write it schematically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> which says that the new variable = some combination of the old variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other kind of substitution is inverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just the reverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, you say that the old variables are some combination of the new.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, often you'll have to stick in a few old variables, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the basic, it's what appears on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, right here, we have an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the way I define the new variable, which of course you have to do if you're introducing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But when I actually did the substitution, I did the inverse substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I used <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the reason for doing that was because it was the capital <EXPRESSION>'s that faced me in the equation and I had to have something to replace them with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you see this already in calculus, this distinction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that might have been a year and a half ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you calculate, and then you would observe that this, the <EXPRESSION>, more or less makes up <EXPRESSION>, apart from a constant factor, there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this would be an example of direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put it in and convert the integral into an integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What would be an example of inverse substitution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I take away the <EXPRESSION> and ask you, instead, to do this integral, then you know that the right thing to do is not to start with <EXPRESSION>, but to start with the <EXPRESSION> and write <EQUATION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11310, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 11311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 196, "end_offset": 201}]}
{"text": "So, this is a direct substitution in that integral, but this integral calls for an inverse substitution in order to be able to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice, they would look practically the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, of course, as you know from your experience, they are not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're very different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I'm going to watch for that distinction as I do these examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> I want to do is an example as a direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, notice, for example, if <EXPRESSION> were <EXPRESSION>, what kind of equation would this be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EQUATION> we already know how to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if <EXPRESSION> were = <EXPRESSION>, you could separate variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that too is not exciting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, nonetheless, it will be included in what I'm going to say now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> could be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So anything: even <EXPRESSION> is all right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just silly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any number: it could be negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be fine also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This kind of equation, to give it its name, is called the Bernoulli equation, named after which Bernoulli, I haven't the faintest idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There were, I think, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, they fought with each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, they were all smart.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the key trick, if you like, method, to solving any Bernoulli equation, let me call another thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Most important is what's missing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It must not have a pure <EXPRESSION> term in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that goes for a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it must look exactly like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everything multiplied by <EXPRESSION>, or a power of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> terms.", "entities": [{"id": 11340, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 11341, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Right, it's very easy to contaminate it into an equation that's unsolvable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's got to look just like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you've got <EXPRESSION> on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've got several.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is practical, in some sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do we got?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea is to divide by <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11348, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Ignore all formulas that you're given.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so <EQUATION>, right, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that certainly doesn't look any better than what I started with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in your terms, it probably looks somewhat worse because it's got all those Y's at the denominator, and who wants to see them there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, look at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this very slightly transformed Bernoulli equation is a linear equation struggling to be free.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is it trying to be a linear equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make a new variable, call this hunk of it in new variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you like, you can think of that as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION> prime?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is the direct substitution I am going to use, but of course, the problem is, what am I going to use on this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the little miracle happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "As I said, you could separate variables if <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the equation, then, turned into?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, solve it as a linear equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Solve it as a linear equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You notice, it's not in standard form, not in standard linear form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To do that, you're going to have to put the p on the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's okay, that term, on the other side, solve it, and at the end, don't forget that you put in the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It wasn't in the original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you have to convert the problem, the answer, back in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do a really simple example just to illustrate the method, and to illustrate the fact that I don't want you to memorize formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Learn methods, not final formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, suppose the equation is, let's say, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11368, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "That's a Bernoulli equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could, of course, have concealed it by writing <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, it wouldn't look instantly like a Bernoulli equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would have to stare at it a while and say, hey, that's a Bernoulli equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, but so I'm handing it to you a silver platter, as it were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what do we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide through by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11371, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So, it's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the substitution, then, I'm going to make, is for this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11377, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "Okay, so what's this thing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only thing is it's got a negative sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is <EQUATION> stays <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's put that in standard form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it will turn into <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11387, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So, that's the linear equation in standard linear form that we are asked to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the solution isn't very hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That makes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, so, it's <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, which is, of course, just <EXPRESSION> itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> for the maybe I shouldn't skip a step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You are still learning this stuff, so let's not skip a step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it becomes <EQUATION>, okay?", "entities": [{"id": 11400, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "After I multiplied through by the integrating factor, this now says this is <EXPRESSION>, and I quickly check that that, in fact, is what it's =, = <EXPRESSION>, and therefore <EQUATION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"id": 11404, "label": "command", "start_offset": 187, "end_offset": 191}]}
{"text": "And, therefore, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can leave it at that form, or you can combine terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't matter much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Am I done?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> wasn't in the original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was <EXPRESSION> that was in the original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, the relation is, <EXPRESSION> is the reciprocal of the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, I have to turn this expression upside down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you're going to have to turn it upside down, you probably should make it look a little better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's rewrite it as <EXPRESSION>, combining fractions, I think they call it in high school or elementary school, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "How's that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION>, you don't call it constant <EXPRESSION> because this is just as arbitrary to call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'll call that, so, my answer will be <EQUATION> plus an arbitrary constant.", "entities": [{"id": 11418, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "But, to indicate it's different from that <EXPRESSION>, I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the old <EXPRESSION>, but that doesn't really matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there's the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has an arbitrary constant in it, but you note it's not an additive arbitrary constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The arbitrary constant is tucked into the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you had to satisfy an initial condition, you would take this form, and starting from this form, figure out what <EXPRESSION> was in order to satisfy that initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thus, Bernoulli equation is solved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION> Bernoulli equation: isn't that exciting?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here was the equation, and there is its solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope you will find them interesting questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You already have the experimental evidence from the <EXPRESSION> problem set, and the problem is to explain the experimental evidence by actually solving the equation in the scene.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you'll find it interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, maybe that's just a pious hope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's unfortunately just the right word to describe them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is different, but nonetheless, the <EXPRESSION> uses of the word have the same common source.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The homogeneous differential equation, homogeneous newspeak, is <EXPRESSION> =, it's a question of what the right hand side looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, now, the supposed way to say it is, you should be able to write the right-hand side as a function of a combined variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, after fooling around with the right hand side a little bit, you should be able to write it so that every time a variable appears, it's always in the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give some examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, suppose <EXPRESSION> were, let's say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11440, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 11441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "Well, that doesn't look in that form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, yes it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Imagine dividing the top and bottom by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11443, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11445, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}, {"id": 11446, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "What would you get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is the way it started out looking, but you just said ah-ha, that was a homogeneous equation because I could see it could be written that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about another homogeneous equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that a homogeneous equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course it is: otherwise, why would I be talking about it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it becomes the <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11456, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "It's homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you might say, hey, this looks like you had to be rather clever to figure out if an equation is homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is there some other way?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, there is another way, and it's the other way which explains why it's called homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can think of it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an equation which is, in modern speak, invariant, invariant under the operation zoom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is zoom?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Zoom is, you increase the scale equally on both axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the zoom operation is the <EXPRESSION> which sends <EXPRESSION> into a times <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> into a times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11462, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 80}, {"id": 11463, "label": "command", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 124}]}
{"text": "In other words, you change the scale on both axes by the same factor, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what I say is, gee, maybe you shouldn't write it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why don't we say, we introduce, how about this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, think of it as a change of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will write it like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can put here an = sign, if you don't know what this meaningless arrow means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm making this change of variables, and I'm describing it as an inverse substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, it wouldn't make any difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's exactly the same as the direct substitution I started out with underscaling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only difference is, I'm not using different scales on both axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm expanding them both equally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I mean by zoom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what happens to the equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what happens to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, the ratio, <EXPRESSION> is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the left-hand side becomes <EXPRESSION>, and the right-hand side becomes <EXPRESSION> of, well, <EXPRESSION> is the same as <EXPRESSION> over, since I've scaled them equally, this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11477, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}, {"id": 11478, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 11479, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 68}, {"id": 11480, "label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION>, and the net effect is I simply, everywhere I have an <EXPRESSION>, I change it to <EXPRESSION>, and wherever I have a <EXPRESSION>, I change it to <EXPRESSION>, which, what's in a name?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the identical equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I haven't changed the equation at all via zoom transformation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's what makes it homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not an uncommon use of the word homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you say space is homogeneous, every direction, well, that means, I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It means, okay, I'm getting into trouble there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll let it go since I can't prepare any better, I haven't prepared any better explanation, but this is a pretty good <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so, suppose we've got a homogeneous equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we solve it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's our equation, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what substitution would you like to make?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Obviously, we should make a direct substitution, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, why did he say that this was going to be an example of inverse substitution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I wanted to confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But look, that's fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you write it in that form, you'll know exactly what to do with the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this is why everybody loves to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I can testify, for many years of looking with sinking heart at examination papers, what happens if you try to make a direct substitution like this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You say, oh, I need <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> =, well, I better use the quotient rule for differentiating that.", "entities": [{"id": 11491, "label": "method", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "And, it comes out this long, and then either a long pause, what do I do now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's not at all obvious what to do at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, much worse, <EXPRESSION> pages of frantic calculations, and giving up in total despair.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason for that is because you tried to do it making a direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All you have to do instead is use it, treat it as an inverse substitution, write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11494, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "What's the motivation for doing that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's clear from the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This goes through all of mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whenever you have to change a variable, excuse me, whenever you have to change a variable, look at what you have to substitute for, and focus your attention on that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, well, then I better know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I know what <EXPRESSION> is, do I know what <EXPRESSION> is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, of course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, I turned with that <EXPRESSION> stroke, the equation has now become <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I solve that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That can be solved because this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11508, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 11509, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "And now, this side is just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Separate variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the only thing to watch out for is, at the end, the <EXPRESSION> was your business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've got to put the answer back in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's work an example of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since I haven't done any modeling yet this period, let's make a little model, differential equations model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a physical situation, which will be solved by an equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, guess what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The equation will turn out to be homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so the situation is as follows.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are in the Caribbean somewhere, a little isolated island somewhere with a little lighthouse on it at the origin, and a beam of light shines from the lighthouse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The beam of light can rotate the way the lighthouse beams.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, this particular beam is being controlled by a guy in the lighthouse who can aim it wherever he wants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the drug boat, which has just been caught in a beam of light, and feels it'd a better escape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the lighthouse keeper wants to keep the drug boat; the light is shining on it so that the U.S. Coast Guard helicopters can zoom over it and do whatever they do to drug boats, I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the drug boat immediately has to follow an escape strategy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the only <EXPRESSION> that occurs to him is, well, he wants to go further away, of course, from the lighthouse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, it doesn't seem sensible to do it in a straight line because the beam will keep shining on him.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, of course, the lighthouse guy keeps the beam always on the boat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's not clear it's a good strategy, but this is a differential equations class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, what's the path of the boat?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the boat's path?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, an obvious question is, why is this a problem in differential equations at all?", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, looking at this, you might scratch your head and try to think of different ways to solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what suggests that it's going to be a problem in differential equations?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, you're looking for a path.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is going to be a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A curve means a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are looking for an unknown function, in other words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what type of information do we have about the function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its slope makes a constant known angle to a known angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you are trying to find a function, and all you know is something about its slope, that is a problem in differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's try to solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me draw just a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's the horizontal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's introduce the coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, there's the horizontal and here's the boat to indicate where I am with respect to the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's the boat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the beam, and the path of the boat is going to make a <EXPRESSION> degree angle with it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is the path that we are talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, let's label what I know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this angle is <EXPRESSION> degrees.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's call this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what I want to know is what the slope of the whole path is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's its slope?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, its slope is the tangent of the sum of these <EXPRESSION> angles, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what do I know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I know that the tangent of <EXPRESSION> is how much?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, if this was the point, <EXPRESSION>, this is the angle it makes with a horizontal, if you think of it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the tangent of the angle is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, and there's a formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the hard part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what do I get then?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, oh, I like that combination, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there is no reason for doing anything to it, but let's make it look a little prettier, and thereby, make it less obvious that it's a homogeneous equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I multiply top and bottom by <EXPRESSION>, it looks prettier.", "entities": [{"id": 11549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 11550, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 11551, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, notice, that let step to make it look pretty has undone the good work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But here, it's a lot clearer that it's a homogeneous equation because it's already been written in the right form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's solve it now, since we know what to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to use as the new variable, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, with that, let's solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The equation becomes <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11557, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And now, as you realize, putting it on the other side, I'm going to have to turn it upside down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just as before, if you have to turn something upside down, it's better to combine the terms, and make it <EXPRESSION> tiny little fraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Otherwise, you are in for quite a lot of mess if you don't do this nicely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that will be <EXPRESSION> on the left-hand side and on the right-hand side, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11573, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 51}, {"id": 11574, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "Well, that's ready to be integrated just as it stands.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about the term <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that integrates to be a logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is more or less the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Therefore, I should put a minus sign, and I should multiply that by half to make it come out right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this is <EXPRESSION> on the right hand side plus, put in that arbitrary constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's now fool around with it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to remember your innocence, although probably a lot of you are better calculators than I am.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to change this, use as many laws of logarithms as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to put this in the exponent, and put this on the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11588, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Or all the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> from the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do you do that here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what I could do, let me just rewrite it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's gonna be <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11607, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So let's see, we can multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and let's see, so then we're gonna have, that cancels with that if we treat it as just a value, or as a variable.", "entities": [{"id": 11609, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 29}, {"id": 11610, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "We're gonna have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we're not quite done yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11614, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11615, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "So if we divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>,<EXPRESSION>, the left hand side, we could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>, is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>, and now, we can integrate both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 11621, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}, {"id": 11622, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 11623, "label": "command", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 130}, {"id": 11624, "label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 93}, {"id": 11625, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "Let me give myself a little bit more space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, what is, what is this left hand side going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can use, we can use the information they gave us right over here, the fact that our particular solution needs to go through this point to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when <EQUATION>, so when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh sorry, when <EQUATION>, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, so we get <EQUATION>, or we could say <EXPRESSION>, we could multiply both sides times <EXPRESSION>, if then we will get, actually let me just scroll down a little bit, so if you multiply both sides times <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION> or <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11660, "label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 125}, {"id": 11661, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 136}, {"id": 11662, "label": "command", "start_offset": 235, "end_offset": 243}, {"id": 11663, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 244, "end_offset": 254}, {"id": 11665, "label": "command", "start_offset": 291, "end_offset": 302}]}
{"text": "All I did is I multiplied <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> times both sides, and then, let's see, I can subtract <EXPRESSION> from both sides, so <EQUATION>, and then if I multiply both sides by negative <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11672, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 11674, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 68}, {"id": 11675, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 124, "end_offset": 134}, {"id": 11676, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 174, "end_offset": 184}, {"id": 11677, "label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 105}, {"id": 11678, "label": "command", "start_offset": 165, "end_offset": 173}, {"id": 11681, "label": "command", "start_offset": 211, "end_offset": 217}]}
{"text": "So our particular solution is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we are almost done, they didn't just ask for, we didn't just ask for the particular solution, we asked, what is <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we are done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the twelfth lecture, we're going to talk about maxima and minima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's finish up what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We really only just started with maxima and minima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're going to talk about related rates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, right now I want to give you some examples of max-min problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to start with a fairly basic <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the thing about max-min problems?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The main thing is that we're asking you to do a little bit more of the interpretation of word problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So many of the problems are expressed in terms of words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, in this case, we have a wire which is length <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the problem is to find the largest area enclosed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in all of these cases, in all these cases, there's a bunch of words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And your job is typically to draw a diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> thing you want to do is to draw a diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, it can be fairly schematic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's your unit length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when you draw the diagram, you're going to have to pick variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those are really the <EXPRESSION> main tasks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To set up the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're drawing a diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is like word problems of old, in grade school through high school.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Draw a diagram and name the variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll be doing a lot of that today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's my unit length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to choose the variable <EXPRESSION> to be the length of <EXPRESSION> of the pieces of wire.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes the other piece <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's pretty much the whole diagram, except that there's something that we did with the wire after we cut it in half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, we built <EXPRESSION> little boxes out of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like this, these are our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And their side lengths are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far, so good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have to think, well, we want to find the largest area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I need a formula for area in terms of variables that I've described.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's the last thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll give the letter <EXPRESSION> as the label for the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the area is just the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops, that strange <EXPRESSION> got in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far, so good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, The instinct that you'll have, and I'm going to yield to that instinct, is we should charge ahead and just differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll find the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that those are important points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to find the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, we take the derivative we set, the derivative of a with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I do that differentiation, I get the, well, so the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a derivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I differentiate this, I get well, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are <EXPRESSION> minus signs in there, I'll let you ponder that differentiation, which I did by the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hang on a sec, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just wait until we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is there a problem?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, so there's a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which has an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so now, This is = to <EXPRESSION> if and only if <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>, or in other words <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's our critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> is the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the critical value, which is what you get when you evaluate <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far, so good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're not done yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why aren't we done?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we haven't checked the end points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's check the end points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in this problem, the end points are really sort of excluded.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The ends are between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the possible lengths of the cut.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what we should really be doing is evaluating in the limit, so that would be the right-hand limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you plug in <EQUATION>, what you get here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11741, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, at the other end, that's <EXPRESSION> from the left we get <EXPRESSION>, which is also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what you see is that the schematic picture of this function, and isn't even so far off from being the right picture here, is that it's level here as <EXPRESSION> and then it dips down and goes up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, and this level here is a half that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we did not find, when we found the critical point we did not find the largest area enclosed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We found the least area enclosed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you don't pay attention to what the function looks like, not only will you about half the time get the wrong answer, you'll get the absolute worst answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll get the <EXPRESSION> which is the polar opposite from what you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have to pay a little bit of attention to the function that you've got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this case it's just very schematic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It dips down and goes up, and that's true of pretty much most functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're fairly simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They maybe only have <EXPRESSION> critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They only turn around once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then, maybe the critical point is the maximum or maybe it's the minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or maybe it's neither, in fact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll be discussing that maybe some other time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we find here is that we have the least area enclosed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Enclosed is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is true when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And most when there's only <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is more or less the limiting situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> of the pieces disappears.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so that's the <EXPRESSION> kind of example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just want to make <EXPRESSION> more comment about terminology before we go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will introduce it with the following question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what is the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The lowest value of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer to that question is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the problem with this question and you will, so that refers to the minimum value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then there's this other question which is where is the minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer to that is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they're <EXPRESSION> separate things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the problem is that people are sloppy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And especially since you usually find the critical point <EXPRESSION>, and the value that is plugging in for a <EXPRESSION>, people will stop short and they'll give the wrong answer to the question, for instance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, both questions are important to answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just need to have a word to put there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a little bit careless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we say what is the minimum, some people will say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's literally wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They know what they mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's just wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when people ask this question, they're being sloppy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They should maybe be a little clearer and say what's the minimum value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, where is the value achieved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's achieved at, or where is the minimum value achieved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "'Where is min achieved?', would be a better way of phrasing this <EXPRESSION> question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that it has an unambiguous answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when people ask you for the minimum point, they're also - so why is it that we call it the minimum point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this word, critical point, which is what <EQUATION> is in critical value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'm making those same distinctions here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's another notion of a minimum point, and this is an alternative if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, that's a point on the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the point - well, so that graph is way up there, but I'll just put it on there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might say min there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might point to this point, and you might say max.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, this <EXPRESSION> might be a max.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, what this means is simply that people are a little sloppy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And sometimes they mean <EXPRESSION> thing and sometimes they mean another.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's a good - very good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go, find the largest area enclosed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's sort of a trick question, isn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are various - that's a good thing to ask.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's sort of a trick question, why?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because according to the rules, we're trapped between the <EXPRESSION> maxima at something which is strictly below.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, <EXPRESSION> answer to this question would be, and this is the answer that I would probably give, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's not really true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that's only in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, or as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you like, the most is when you've only got <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which breaks the rules of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, essentially, it's a trick question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I would answer it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that's the most interesting part of the answer, which is that it's <EXPRESSION> and it occurs really when <EXPRESSION> of the squares disappears to nothing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let's do another example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, since the question was, what was the largest area, why did we find the least area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason is that when we go about our procedure of looking for the least, or the most, we'll automatically find both.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we don't know which <EXPRESSION> is which until we compare values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, it's much more to your advantage to figure out both the maximum and minimum whenever you answer such a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because otherwise you won't understand the behavior of the function very well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We answered the question of what the largest and the smallest value was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Also, I'm wondering if you can check both the minimum  approaches .", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> can also use, the question is, can we use the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is, yes we can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, you can actually also stare at this and see that it's a sum of squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's always curving up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a parabola with a positive <EXPRESSION> coefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can differentiate this twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's an acceptable way of figuring it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll mention the <EXPRESSION> derivative test again, in this <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, this is going to be another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, when I say minimum or maximum point which will I mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just repeated the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, when I say minimum point, what will I mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is that for the purposes of this class I will probably avoid saying that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I will say, probably, where is the minimum achieved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just in order to avoid that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I actually sat at I often am referring to the graph, and I mean this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll make this very clear when we were doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, I just want to prepare you for the fact that in real life, and even me when I'm talking colloquially, when I say what's the minimum point of something, I might actually be mixing it up with this other notion here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an example to get us used to the notion of constraints.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have, so consider a box without a top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you like, we're going to find the box without a top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With least surface area for a fixed volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the box without a top with least surface area for a fixed volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The procedure for working this out is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You make this diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you set up the variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll choose them in a kind of a standard way, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> I have to tell you <EXPRESSION> more thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is something that we could calculate separately but I'm just going to give it to you in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that it turns out that the best box has a square bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to get rid of <EXPRESSION> of our variables for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's got a square bottom, and so let's draw a picture of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that goes down like this, almost.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should get it a little farther down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's correct that just a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, what about the dimensions of this box?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and this is very foreshortened, but it's also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11809, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "The bottom is <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, it's the same dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the vertical dimension is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far, so good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to compute the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The volume is, the base is <EXPRESSION>, and the height is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the area, the area is the area of the bottom, which is <EXPRESSION>, that's the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there are the <EXPRESSION> sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, there's no top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's our setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's what's called a constraint here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, we've fixed the relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, that means that we can solve for <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we have a which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, will you need to know this intuitively?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's something that I would have to give to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it's actually true that a lot of things, the correct answer is something symmetric.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this last problem, the minimum turned out to be exactly halfway in between because there were sort of = demands from the <EXPRESSION> sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, here, what happens is if you elongate <EXPRESSION> side, you get less - it actually is involved with a <EXPRESSION> variable problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if you have a rectangle and you have a certain amount of length associated with it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the optimal thing you can do with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I won't, in other words, the optimal rectangle, the least perimeter rectangle, turns out to be a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the little sub-problem that leads you to this square bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But so that would have been a separate max-min problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I'm skipping, because I what to do this slightly more interesting <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's our formula for a, and now I want to follow the same procedure as before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, we look for the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we set that = <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11841, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 11843, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How did that happen to change into <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Interesting, guess that's wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we are not done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not done, because we don't even know whether this is going to give us the worst box or the best box, from this point of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's check the ends, right away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To see what's happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So can somebody tell me what the ends, what the end values of <EXPRESSION> are?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where does <EXPRESSION> range from?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the smallest <EXPRESSION> can be, yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the claim was that the largest <EXPRESSION> could be <EXPRESSION>, because somehow there's this <EXPRESSION> here and you can't get any further past than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's a key feature here of this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that a is variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only thing that's fixed in the problem is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is fixed, what do you know about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The lower end point, that's safe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that has to do geometrically with the fact that we don't have any boxes with negative dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be refused by the Post Office, definitely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over and above the empty top, which they wouldn't accept either.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's true that <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's using this relationship.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But notice that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, I just got a guess there over here, that's right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the upper limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is really important to realize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is most problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Most problems, the variable if it doesn't have a limitation, usually just goes out to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is a very important end for the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's usually an easy end to the problem, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a possibility that if we push all the way down to <EQUATION>, we'll get a better box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be very strange box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A little bit like our vanishing enclosure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe an infinitely long box, also very inconvenient <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Might be the best box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll have to see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just take a look at what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're looking at <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens to that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice right here, this is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is infinite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that turns out to be a bad box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take a look at the other end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, this term here means that this thing is infinite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the shape of this thing, I'll draw this tiny little schematic diagram over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The shape of this thing is like this, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, when we find that <EXPRESSION> turnaround point, which happened to be at this strange point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that is going to be the minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've just discovered that it's the minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is just what we were hoping for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be the optimal box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, since you asked earlier and since it's worth checking this as well, let's also check an alternative justification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So an alternative to checking ends is the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do not recommend the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I try my best, when I give you problems, to make it really hard to apply the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.", "entities": [{"id": 11885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 72}, {"id": 11887, "label": "method", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "But in this example, the function is simple enough so that it's perfectly OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take the derivative here, remember, this was whatever it was, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take the <EXPRESSION> derivative, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing is concave up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's consistent with its being, the critical point is a min.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is a minimum point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See how I almost said, is a min, as opposed to minimum point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So watch out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're <EXPRESSION> step ahead of me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, is this the answer to the question or would we have to give <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and so on and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, again, this is something that I want to emphasize and take my time with right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it depends, what kind of real life problem you're answering, what kind of answer is appropriate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far we've found the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't found the critical value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't found the dimensions of the box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to spend a little bit more time on this, exactly in order to address these questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And certainly if you're going to build the box, you also want to know what the <EXPRESSION> value is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> value is going to be, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the <EXPRESSION> value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On top of that, we could figure out the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's also a perfectly reasonable part of the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Depending on what <EXPRESSION> is interested in, you might care how much money it's going to cost you to build this box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This optimal box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you plug in the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11906, "label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11910, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So if you like, <EXPRESSION> way of answering this question is these <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be the minimum point corresponding to the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be the answer to this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the reason why I'm carrying it out in such detail is I want to show you that there are much more meaningful ways of answering this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me explain that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me go through some more meaningful answers here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That happens to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want to expand the volume, you'll have to expand the area by the <EXPRESSION> of the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other dimensionless quantity is the <EXPRESSION>:<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, again, that's inches divided by inches.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's <EXPRESSION>, which happens to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is actually the best answer to the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it shows you that the box is a <EXPRESSION>:<EXPRESSION> box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>, that's the good box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is just the shape, if you like, and it's the optimal shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And certainly that, aesthetically, that's the cleanest answer to the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There was a question right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Could you repeat that, I couldn't hear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm wondering if you'd be able to get that answer if you  square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, could we have gotten the answer if we weren't told that the bottom was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, yes in <EXPRESSION> with multivariable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would have to have <EXPRESSION> letters here, an <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>, and a <EXPRESSION>, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you'd have to work with all <EXPRESSION> of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I separated out into <EXPRESSION>, there's a separate <EXPRESSION> variable problem that you can do for the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this is a <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> variable problem for this other thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's just <EXPRESSION> consecutive <EXPRESSION> variable problems that solve the multivariable problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why did I divide <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, rather than <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, or in any?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, again, what I was aiming for was dimensionless quantities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are measured in the same units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also the proportions of the box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's another word for this is proportions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Are something that's universal, independent of the volume <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's something you can say about any box, at any scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whether it be, you know, something by Cristo in the Common.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe we'll get in here to do some fancy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The proportions is with geometric problems typically, when there's a scaling to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where the answer is the same at small scales and at large scales.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is capturing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why, the ratios are what's capturing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's why it's aesthetically the nicest thing to ask.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what exactly does the ratio of the <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> ratio  tell us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unfortunately, this number is a really obscure number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is what does this tell us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only thing that I want to emphasize is what's on the left-hand side here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you do this, for example, in general with planar diagrams, circumferenced area is a bad ratio to take.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What you want to take is the square of circumference to area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the square of circumference has the same dimensions; that is, say, inches squared to area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is in square inches.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, again, it's these dimensionless quantities that you want to cook up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And those are the ones that will have universal properties.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The most famous of these is the circle that encloses the most area for its circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, again, that's only true if you take the square of the circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You do the units correctly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're here, we've got a shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've got an answer to this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I now want to do this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's put it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted to do this problem by a different method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I'll take the time to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to do this problem by a slightly different method here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's Example 2 by implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the same example, but now I'm going to do it by implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'll tell you the advantages and disadvantages to this method here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the situation is, you have to start the same way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here is the starting place of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the goal was the minimum of a with <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was the situation that we were in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what I want to do is just differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The function <EXPRESSION> is implicitly a function of <EXPRESSION>, so I can differentiate the <EXPRESSION> expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that yields <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11960, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So this is giving me my implicit formula for <EXPRESSION>, So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or in other words, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I also have the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you may notice I'm not using primes quite as much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because all of the variables are varying, and so here I'm emphasizing that it's a differentiation with respect to the variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 11967, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So again, this is using the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can plug in for what <EXPRESSION> is, which is right above it.", "entities": [{"id": 11969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so let's gather that together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do we have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION>, and then, altogether, this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the same thing as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> goes to the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this, I claim, so you have to decide for yourself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I claim that this is faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's faster, and also it gets to the heart of the matter, which is this scale in variant proportions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is basically also nicer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it gets to the nicer answer, also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those are the advantages that this has.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's faster, and it gets to this, I'm going to call it nicer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the disadvantage is it did not check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whether this critical point is a max, min, or neither.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we didn't quite finish the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we got to the answer very fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so it gives you a candidate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is - so the question is, how would you check it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is that for this particular problem, the only way to do it is to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, it doesn't save you that much time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But with many, many, examples, you actually can tell immediately that if the <EXPRESSION> ends, the thing is, say, <EXPRESSION>, and inside it's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Things like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in many, many, cases this is just as good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm going to change subjects here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the subject that I'm going to talk about next is almost, is very, very closely linked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I talked about implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we're going to just talk about dealing with lots of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And rates of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, essentially, we're going to talk about the same type of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to tell you about a subject which is called related rates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is really just another excuse for getting used to setting up variables and equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Related rates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's my example for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, again, this is going to be a police problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is going to be a word problem and - sorry, I'm don't want to scare you, no police.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there are police in the story but they're not present.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, but I'm going to draw it immediately with the diagram because I'm going to save us the trouble.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although, you know, the point here is to get from the words to the diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the road.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you're coming along, here, in your, let's see, in your car going in this direction here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the police have radar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is bouncing off of your car.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what they read off is that you're <EXPRESSION> feet away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the question is, are you speeding.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the threshold here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I want to do now is show you how you set up a problem like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, and because it's the distance to a straight line you know that this is a right angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that this is a right triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the question is, how do we put the letters in to make his problem work, to figure out what the rate of change is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let me explain that right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will actually do the computation next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> thing is, you have to understand what's changing and what's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, an important distance here is the distance to this foot of this perpendicular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to name that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to give that letter <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> is varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason why I need a letter for it as opposed to this <EXPRESSION> is that it's going to have a rate of change with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, it's related to, the question is whether <EXPRESSION> is faster or slower than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the thing that's varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's something else that's varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This distance here is also varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need a letter for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We do not need a letter for this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's never changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're assuming the police are parked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're not ready to roar out and catch you just yet, and they're certainly not in motion when they've got the radar guns aimed at you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need to know something about the sociology and style of police.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need to know things about the real world.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how fast you're approaching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's measured along the radar gun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim that that's d by dt of this quantity here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> is also changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why we needed a letter for it, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, next time, we'll just put that all together and compute <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> correction from last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry to say, I forgot a very important factor when I was telling you what an average value is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't put in that factor, it's only half off on the exam problem that will be given on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I would have gotten half off for missing out on this factor, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember you have to divide by <EXPRESSION> here, certainly when you're integrating over <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, the Riemann sum is the numerator here.", "entities": [{"id": 12006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "This was meant to illustrate this idea that we're dividing by the total here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we are going to be talking about average value in more detail.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not today, though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this has to do with average value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll discuss it in considerable detail in a couple of days, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, today I want to continue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And anyway it's very important to write it down on the board twice, because you want to see it at least twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And many more times as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says that the derivative of an integral gives you the function back again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way I'd like to use it today, I started this discussion last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we didn't get into it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is something that's on your problem set along with several other examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that we can use this to solve differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in particular, for example, we can solve the equation <EQUATION> with this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, using an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The function <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that formula can be taken to be the starting place for the derivation of all the properties of the logarithm function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're going to do right now is we're going to take this to be the definition of the logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we do that, then I claim that we can read off the properties of the logarithm just about as easily as we could before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'll illustrate that now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are a few other examples of this where somewhat more unfamiliar functions come up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> that in theory we know something about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> property of this function is the <EXPRESSION> that's already given.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, its derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we get a lot of information just out of the fact that its derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other thing that we need in order to nail down the function, besides its derivative, is <EXPRESSION> value of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's really not specified by this equation, only specified up to a constant by this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we're getting the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the case with all these definite integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you evaluate them at their starting places, the value will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And together these <EXPRESSION> properties specify this function <EXPRESSION>, uniquely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the next step is to try to think about what its properties are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, notice that when you have a function which is given as an integral, its <EXPRESSION> derivative is really easy to compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then its <EXPRESSION> derivative, well, you have to differentiate whatever you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it may or may not be easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it's relatively easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are the properties that I'm going to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I won't really use very much more about it than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then to get started with the graph, since I see I have a value here, which is <EQUATION>, I'm going to throw in the value of the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, which I know is <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, that's reading off from this equation here, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm ready to sketch at least a part of the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a sketch of the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the tangent line, I know, has slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the curve is concave down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Incidentally, it's also increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's an important property, it's strictly increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we can get from this the following important definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which, again, is working backwards from this definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can get to where we started with a <EXPRESSION> in our previous discussion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if I take the level here, which is <EQUATION>, then that crosses the axis someplace.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And his point is what we're going to define as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the definition of <EXPRESSION> is that it's the value such that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, the fact that there's exactly <EXPRESSION> such place just comes from the fact that this <EXPRESSION> is positive, so that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, there's just <EXPRESSION> other feature of this graph that I'm going to emphasize to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's <EXPRESSION> other thing which I'm not going to check, which you would ordinarily do with graphs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once it's increasing there are no critical points, so the only other interesting thing is the <EXPRESSION>'s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it turns out that the limit as you go down to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you go over to the right here it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does get arbitrarily high; it doesn't level off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm not going to discuss that here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead, I'm going to just remark on <EXPRESSION> qualitative feature of the graph, which is this remark that the part which is to the left of <EXPRESSION> is below <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just want to remark, why is <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I don't have room for that, so I'll just put in here <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to give you <EXPRESSION> reasons.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just that the property that <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you read that backwards, if it gets up to <EXPRESSION> here, it must have been negative before <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> way of seeing that <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a <EXPRESSION> way of seeing it, which is equally important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it has to do with just manipulation of integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here I'm going to start out with <EXPRESSION>, and its definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to reverse the order of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I can tell that this quantity is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason that I can tell is that this chunk of it here, this piece of it, is a positive number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This part is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this part is positive because <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is less than the <EXPRESSION>, and so this is interpreted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The thing in the green box is interpreted as an area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>'s <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So both of these work perfectly well as interpretations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's just to illustrate what we can do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's <EXPRESSION> more manipulation of integrals that gives us the fanciest property of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the last <EXPRESSION> that I'm going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you have a similar thing on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to prove that this is, as I say, the fanciest property of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On your homework, by the way, you're going to check that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll do this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea is just to plug in the formula and see what it gives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the left-hand side, I have <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that's certainly = to the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to now split this into <EXPRESSION> pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is a property of integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That if you have an integral from <EXPRESSION> place to another, you can break it up into pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to start at <EXPRESSION> but then go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to continue from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the question that we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't proved this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this <EXPRESSION> is actually true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we want this to be true, we know by definition <EXPRESSION> is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know, we can see it, that <EXPRESSION> is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question that this boils down to is, we want to know that these <EXPRESSION> things are =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to know that <EXPRESSION> is that other integral there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's check it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to rewrite the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the integral from - sorry, from <EXPRESSION> a to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, again, to illustrate properties of integrals, the key property here that we're going to have to use is change of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a kind of a scaled integral where everything is <EXPRESSION> from what we want to get to this <EXPRESSION> quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this suggests that we write down <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12123, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "That's going to be our trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've now substituted in for the integrand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But on top of this, with definite integrals, we also have to check the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the limits work out as follows.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EQUATION>, that's the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that <EXPRESSION> =, what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EQUATION>, this is if and only if.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this lower limit, which really in disguise was where <EQUATION>, becomes where <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the upper limit here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if you notice, we're just going to cancel these <EXPRESSION> factors here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we recognize that this is just the same as the definition of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is over here in the box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is what we wanted to show.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last example, that I'm going to discuss of this type, I already mentioned last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It really is not any function that you can express in terms of the functions that we know already.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the approach, always, to these new functions is to think of what their properties are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we think of functions in order to understand them is to maybe sketch them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what is it that I can get out of this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, immediately I can figure out what the derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I read it off from the fundamental theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I also can figure out the value at the starting place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, the starting place is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the value is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I should check the <EXPRESSION> derivative, which is also not so difficult to compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now I can see that this function is increasing, because this derivative is positive, it's always increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's going to be concave down when <EXPRESSION> is positive and concave up when <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because there's a minus sign here, so the sign is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is less than <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is positive and greater than <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe to get started I'll remind you <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also true that <EXPRESSION>, that just comes right out of this, <EQUATION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means the tangent line again has slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We do this a lot with functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We normalize them so that their slopes of their tangent lines are <EXPRESSION> at convenient spots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the tangent line of slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know this thing is concave down to the right and concave up to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so it's going to look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With an inflection point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Really, you want to know this graph as well as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so there are just a couple more features.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the property that turns out that this function is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's known as an odd function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason why it's odd is that it's the antiderivative of something that's even.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This function in here is even.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we nailed it down so that it was <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way of interpreting that, and let me show it to you underneath, is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we look at its derivative, its derivative, course, is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this shape here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can see the slope is <EXPRESSION>, but fairly close to <EXPRESSION>, but positive along here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's getting, this is its steepest point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the highest point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it's leveling off again; the slope is going down, always positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the interpretation of the function that's up above is that the value here is the area from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is area <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll color it in, decorate it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this area here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I want to show you this odd property, by using this symmetry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The graph here is even, so in other words, what's back here is exactly the same as what's forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now there's a reversal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we're keeping track of the area starting from <EXPRESSION> going forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we go backwards, it's counted negatively.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we went backwards to - <EXPRESSION>, we'd get exactly the same as that green patch over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'd get a red patch over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it would be counted negatively.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the property that it's odd.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can also check this by properties of integrals directly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be just like this process here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's completely analogous to checking this formula over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> of the comments I wanted to make about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why does this save us a lot of time, if we know this is odd?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know that the shape of this branch is exactly the reverse, or the reflection, if you like, of the shape of this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we want to do is flip it under the axis and then reflect it over that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the symmetry property of the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last property that I want to mention is what's happening with the ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at the end there's an asymptote, there's a limit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an asymptote.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same thing down here, which will be exactly because of the odd feature, this'll be exactly negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The opposite value over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might ask yourself, what level is this, exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that level turns out to be a very important quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's interpreted down here as the area under this whole infinite stretch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's all the way out to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do you think it is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're all clueless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, maybe not all of you, you're just afraid to say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the square root of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was right on the tip of your tongue, wasn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah, yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, so this is actually very un-obvious, but it's a very important quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's an amazing fact that this thing approaches this number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's something that people worried about for many years before actually nailing down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what I just claimed here is that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, if you do it to <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for this reason, people introduce a new function because they like the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This function is <EXPRESSION>, short for error function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's <EXPRESSION> times the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it's just our original, our previous <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the function which gets tabulated quite a lot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see it on the internet everywhere, and it's a very important function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are other normalizations that are used, and the discussions of the other normalizations are in your problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> of them, and another <EXPRESSION> is in your exercises.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The standard normal distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are tons of functions like this, which are new functions that we can get at once we have the tool of integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll write down just <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> more, just so that you'll see the variety.", "entities": [{"id": 12212, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "Here's <EXPRESSION> which is called a Fresnel integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On your problem set next week, we'll do the other Fresnel integral, we'll look at this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These functions cannot be expressed in elementary terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> on your homework for this week was this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> comes up in Fourier analysis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to just tell you maybe <EXPRESSION> more such function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a function which is called <EXPRESSION>, logarithmic integral of <EXPRESSION>, which is this guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reciprocal of the logarithm, the natural log.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the significance of this <EXPRESSION> is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, if you can make this as precise as possible, you'll be famous for millennia, because this is known as the Riemann hypothesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exactly how closely this approximation occurs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's a hard problem, and already a century ago the prime number theorem, which established this connection was extremely important to progress in math.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is this stuff you're supposed to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I love that question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, this is, so we launched off into something here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me just explain it to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to be talking a fair amount more about this particular function, because it's associated to the normal distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to let you get familiar with it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I'm doing here is purely cultural.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, after this panel, what I'm doing is purely cultural.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just saying there's a lot of other beasts out there in the world.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> of them is called <EXPRESSION> of .", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll have a just a very passing familiarity with <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> of these functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there are literally dozens and dozens of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only thing that you'll need to do with such functions is things like understanding the derivative, the <EXPRESSION> derivative, and tracking what the function does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sketching the same way you did with any other tool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to do this type of thing with these functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll have to lead you through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I wanted to ask you a question about <EXPRESSION> of these functions, I have to tell you exactly what I'm aiming for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, I did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I called these guys Fresnel integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The guy's name is Fresnel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just named after a person.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, and this <EXPRESSION>, Li's logarithmic integral, it's not named after a person.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Logarithm is not somebody's name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So look, in fact this will be mentioned also on a problem set, but I don't expect you to remember these names.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, that you definitely don't want to try to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, will we prove this limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is yes, if we have time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll be in about a week or so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not going to do it now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It takes us quite a bit of work to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to change years now, I'm going to shift gears.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to go back to a more standard thing which has to do with just setting up integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this has to do with understanding where integrals play a role, and they play a role in cumulative sums, in evaluating things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is much more closely associated with the <EXPRESSION> Fundamental Theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, we'll take, today we were talking about how integrals are formulas for functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or solutions to differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to go back and talk about integrals as being the answer to a question as opposed to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we've done now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, and the <EXPRESSION> example, or most of the examples for now, are going to be taken from geometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Later on we'll get to probability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> topic is just areas between curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a couple of curves that look like this and maybe like this, and you want to start at a place a and you want to end at a place <EXPRESSION>, then you can chop it up the same way we did with Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And take a chunk that looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to write the thickness of that chunk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's give these things names.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the thickness.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is the height?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the height is the difference between the top value and the bottom value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is, if you like, base times - whoops, backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is height, and this is the base of the rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are approximately correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, only in limit when this is an infinitesimal, is it exactly right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order to get the whole area, I have add these guys up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to integrate from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12241, "label": "method", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "That's summing them, that's adding them up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to be my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the story here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me just say <EXPRESSION> things about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all, on a very abstract level before we get started with details of more complicated problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is that every problem that I'm going to be talking about from now on for, several days, involves the following collection of, the following goals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to identify something to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's called an integrand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to identify what are known as the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The whole game is simply to figure out what <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and this quantity is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the minute we have that, we can calculate the integral if we like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have numerical procedures or maybe we have analytic procedures, but anyway we can get at the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The goal here is to set them up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to set them up, you must know these <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>, and what we're integrating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you leave <EXPRESSION> of these out, it's like the following thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I ask you what the area of this region is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I left out this end, how could I possibly know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't even know where it starts, so how can I figure out what this area is if I haven't identified what the left side is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can't leave out the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's sitting here, in this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I need to know where it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I need to know the top and I need to know this side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I don't incorporate them into the information, I'll never get anything out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I need to know everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I need to know exactly those things, in order to have a formula for the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, when this gets carried out in practice, as we will do now in our <EXPRESSION> example, it's more complicated than it looks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is our <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me make sure that I chose the example that I wanted to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's a <EXPRESSION> step in figuring these things out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is that you must draw a picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't draw a picture you'll never figure out what this area is, because you'll never figure out what's what between these curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> curve, <EQUATION>, is a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's pointing this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's this parabola here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes through this place here, which is <EXPRESSION> over and has slope <EXPRESSION>, so it does this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this shape in here is what we mean by the area between the curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now that we see what it is, we have a better idea of what our goal is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you haven't drawn it, you have no hope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to describe <EXPRESSION> ways of getting at this area here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is motivated by the shape that I just described right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I'm going to use it in a straightforward way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to chop things up into these vertical pieces just as I did right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, here's the difficulty with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The difficulty is that the upper curve here has <EXPRESSION> formula but the lower curve shifts from being a part of the parabola to being a part of the straight line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that there are <EXPRESSION> different formulas for the lower function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the only way to accommodate that is to separate this up into <EXPRESSION> halves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Separate it out into <EXPRESSION> halves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to have to divide it right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question?So, you're <EXPRESSION> step ahead of me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll also have to be sure to distinguish between the top branch and the bottom branch of the parabola, which we're about to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we will do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the top part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll call it top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are pink, and I guess this is blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so now let's see what's happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, really I'm going to have to figure out <EXPRESSION> points, I claim.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to have to figure out where this point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where this point is, and where that point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Could you speak up?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, why do we need to split up the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think in order to answer that question further, I'm going to have to go into the details of the method, and then you'll see where it's necessary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> step is that I'm going to figure out what these <EXPRESSION> points are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is kind of easy; it's the point (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can identify them by the following equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to see where these curves intersect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At what, well, if I plug in <EQUATION>, I get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12295, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And then I can solve this quadratic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is telling me that <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've found <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means this point down here has <EXPRESSION> entry <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to square, this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12305, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So that's the formula for this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other point has <EXPRESSION> entry <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, again, with his formula <EQUATION>, I have to <EXPRESSION> to get <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I claim I have enough data to get started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need the top, the bottom left, and the bottom right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The top is the formula for this branch of <EQUATION>, which is in the positive <EXPRESSION> region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bottom curve, part of the parabola, so this is the bottom left, is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the other branch of the square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is exactly what you were asking before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is, we have to distinguish between these <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the point is, these formulas really are different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're not the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last bit is the bottom right chunk here, which is this pink part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Bottom right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm ready to find the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the left part, plus the right part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to figure out what the range of <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> I'm going to - well, let's leave ourselves a little more room than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to be safe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, here's the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we have our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I need to figure out the starting place and the ending place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the starting place is the leftmost place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The leftmost place is over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to travel from this vertical line to the green line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the difference between the orange curve and the blue curve is what I call top and bottom left, over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is what I call top, and this was bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But only the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim that's giving me the left half of this, the left section of this diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm going to do the right section of the diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I start at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The lower limit is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I go all the way to this point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the last bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The upper limit here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have to take the difference between the top and the bottom again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The top is <EXPRESSION> all over again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the bottom has changed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bottom is now the quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Please don't forget your parenthesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's going to be minus signs and cancellations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is almost the end of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rest of it is routine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We would just have to evaluate these integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, fortunately, I'm going to spare you that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not going to bother to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the easy part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not going to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to show you that there's a much quicker way with this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And with this area calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The quicker way is what you see when you see how long this is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other device, which I'll draw over here, schematically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, maybe I'll draw it on this blackboard here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw the picture, at least schematically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's our picture that we had before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now instead of slicing it vertically, I'm going to slice it horizontally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the dimensions have different names.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the principle is similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The width, we now call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this distance here, from the left end to the right end, we have to figure out what the formulas for those things are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So on the left, maybe I'll draw them color coded again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, whoops, orange is right, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the left, which is this green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the right, which is orange, is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now in order to use this, it's going to turn out that we want to write <EXPRESSION> as, we want to reverse roles.", "entities": [{"id": 12343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "So we want to write this as <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So we'll use it in this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to set up the integral for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This time, the <EXPRESSION> = an integral in the <EXPRESSION> variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And its starting place is down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's ending place is up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the lowest value of <EXPRESSION>, and this is the top value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we've already computed those things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The lowest level of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this top value is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this goes from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the difference is this distance here, the distance between the rightmost point and the leftmost point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the <EXPRESSION> dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, it's a rectangle but its horizontal is long and its vertical is very short.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what are they?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the difference between the right and the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What was the question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is it right minus left?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's very important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is it right minus left?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's actually the point that I was about to make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION>, which is the right, is bigger than <EXPRESSION>, which is the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you do it backwards, you'll always get a negative number and you'll always get the wrong answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the right-hand end minus the left-hand end gives you a positive number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's not obvious, actually, where you are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's another double-check, by the way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you look at this quantity, you see that the ends pinch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly the crossover points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's not an accident, that's exactly the geometry of the shape that we picked out there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the technique.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is a much more routine integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that this is <EXPRESSION>, evaluated at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which, if you work it out, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're done for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And tomorrow we'll do more volumes, more things including <EXPRESSION> dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then Lax-Friedrichs, if you've noticed, has a sort of jagged profile.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you've realized why that would be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somehow Lax-Friedrichs kind of operates on a staggered grid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll see, actually with I've drawn a staggered grid here, so I can say what I mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, upwind is also smeared out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I was so pleased to see these actually showing on the website and that makes me think of more questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all, as time goes forward, we see this bump beginning to appear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So am I right in thinking that it reaches a certain height and stays there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I guess I'm thinking about sort of further questions, because every time you do a numerical experiment, good additional question show up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ultimately it'd be great to be able to predict what it would be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, does that bump reach a certain height?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you can see it just barely forming and then you see it growing to a certain point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be, does it approach a steady profile?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that height settle down?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'd be fantastic to be able to predict that height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, you always want to know, how do things depend on the parameter?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> parameter we have in this problem is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would be computing that value exactly from this value, at exactly the right slope, on the characteristic, and perfection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now as <EXPRESSION> goes away from <EXPRESSION>, I presume it goes down below <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be on that kind of a staggered grid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So leapfrog you'd think of it right away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you see right away, the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 12409, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "The delta <EXPRESSION> the <EXPRESSION> is our old ratio <EXPRESSION>, so this is easily written in terms of <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does have this <EXPRESSION> time step issue and of course, we have to think about stability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the dependence on <EXPRESSION> would be a the profile dependence on <EXPRESSION>, would be a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just emphasize, what's the goal?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I say that this upwind <EXPRESSION> is smeared out, I mean that it doesn't satisfy what you really hope for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just see what this means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this says, figure out the space differences so this, this minus this and this minus this and then take the time difference of those.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I see what I'll get if I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that'll be this <EXPRESSION> minus this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> plus this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12469, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 37}, {"id": 12471, "label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "Do you see that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we have here is <EXPRESSION> at this point minus <EXPRESSION> at this point minus <EXPRESSION> at this point plus <EXPRESSION> at this point plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12477, "label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": 12478, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 53}, {"id": 12480, "label": "command", "start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 150}, {"id": 12481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 118}]}
{"text": "I claim that we have the same thing here, that if I take the time differences <EXPRESSION> can I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of taking the space differences <EXPRESSION>, I'll take this <EXPRESSION>, this time difference, this minus this and I'll subtract I'm taking now the space difference I'll subtract are you with me?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in a way, this throws light on something that's probably something that we take for granted, but we wouldn't want to be pressed on too closely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So having that identity allows me to do exactly what I did with the continuous case there and show that this, when I eliminate the half levels, I've got ordinary leapfrog.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll be leapfrog.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, here we have a <EXPRESSION> and here a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So altogether, an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's leapfrog.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So can I summarize leapfrog?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, we had <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason it was a quadratic was there were <EXPRESSION> time steps involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We handled that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got stability, if <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That led us to a, in <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that led us to <EXPRESSION> I'll just remember those steps a less or = <EXPRESSION>, and that let us to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do we have coming up?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe important to say what's coming up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Specifically, the Black-Scholes equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you probably know that a lot of effort and a lot of money are going into the valuation of options and other financial derivatives and that this Black-Scholes equation beautifully produced the heat equation, and additional correction terms will produce a convection-diffusion equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an application that we wouldn't have made some years ago, but now it's worth focusing on that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's interesting in itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So nonlinear wave equations and those are called conservation laws.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's after these linear cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm ready to tackle the heat equation, starting then on to the next section of the notes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me tackle it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the heat equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we already see the big difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's a <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, but only a <EXPRESSION> derivative in time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now it will be <EXPRESSION> comparable with <EXPRESSION>, and that's a very significant difference, because that's if <EXPRESSION> is small, <EXPRESSION> is extremely small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is constrained by <EXPRESSION>, we're looking at small time steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're looking at stiff systems, absolutely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be a stiff problem, because the low frequencies and the high frequencies differ enormously in the decay rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, why don't we see it right away, starting as always with exponentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I plug in <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, separating variables as always.", "entities": [{"id": 12547, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, that's a very big difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The difference is enormous here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, energy conserved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>, energy dissipated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We had a ratio <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, when I put that into here let me just do it <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there is the pure exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Simple as always, because we have constant coefficients, but highly informative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess another thing that I read off of that is, what frequencies are decaying fast?", "entities": []}
{"text": "High frequencies?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is large, <EXPRESSION> is very large and <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> is decaying very quickly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So high-frequency noise in this system, roughness, discontinuities are going to get smoothed out, strongly, by moving forward in time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Physically, what's happening is, we have our wavefront, which stayed a perfect step function in the wave equation, will instantly smear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So diffusion smears discontinuity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Heat travels.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were back over here, if the temperature starts out as <EXPRESSION> on this side and <EXPRESSION> on this side, then in an instant, some heat flows from right to left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it flows with infinite speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I now want to write down staying with the differential equation, what do we want to do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did the exponential case and learned a good bit from that, the fast decay of high frequencies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next step would be to put different frequencies, different <EXPRESSION>'s together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By linearity, we can add these solutions, we can multiply that by any numbers we want, depending on <EXPRESSION>; we still have solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can integrate over <EXPRESSION>, so we will, actually.", "entities": [{"id": 12582, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That that will be the next step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write down what that does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to jump, take a little jump here to put on the board what I just said in words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can multiply this, <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> that's what's happening to the pure frequency <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12588, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "If I multiply that by the amount of that frequency which is in the initial condition so here is the initial condition, <EXPRESSION>, and I've taken its Fourier transform.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tells me how much of frequency <EXPRESSION> is in the problem, is in the initial problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tells me how much of frequency <EXPRESSION> is in the initial problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've said that in words, but actually, we could just check it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We would like to know that this left-hand side solves the heat equation, and we would like to know that it has the correct start, the correct <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's check that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, at the start, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it does start out correctly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Should I say that again?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It inverts this transform that we took.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Secondly, does it solve the heat equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you might say, OK, perfection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do we need finite differences?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess we do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is typical of formulas that give the answer exactly, but in terms that are not numerically convenient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because, to use his formula, <EXPRESSION> of all, this this requires an integral, an infinite integral to find integral to find for <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To use this formula, we'd have to find this transform, and then we have to do this integral for the inverse transform, this integral, for the answer, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> infinite integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, not to mention the fact that on a finite interval, when <EXPRESSION> doesn't go all the way from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, we have to think all over again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have a nice formula for the answer, but it looks nice, but it's not numerically terrific.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can get a lot of information out of this and there's <EXPRESSION> other special solution that's also extremely informative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if so I'm going to do a special case, but it's the big case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if the initial conditions is a <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if the initial condition is a <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "An impulse at time <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>, an instant source of heat at a point a point source with finite strength, you could say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "An impulse at times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the wave equation, what happened?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was like turning on a flash of light and it went along the characteristics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the heat equation, it'll be quite different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There aren't characteristics here, but this is an extremely important solution, and I think you could call it the fundamental solution to the heat equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You may know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You may have seen this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's fantastic that we get a formula for this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could say, we've got a formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the Fourier transform, what's <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> for the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The Fourier transform of the <EXPRESSION> is a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All frequencies are there in = amounts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a constant, so I can remove it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm left with a specific integral to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the question is, can I do it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer turns out to be yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can do that integral when this is a constant and that will give you the answer with that starting value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just say what that answer is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the key part of the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a solution which starts from a <EXPRESSION>, spreads of course, and the shape as it spreads is a bell.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, always here comes that scalar tells us the width of the bell.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How far has it spread at <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what goes there is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "where there's a heat component that goes into the system, and there's a work component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess if I don't write the sums, the summation convention is assumed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, having gotten this fundamental relation, we can manipulate and write it in different fashion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Rather than <EXPRESSION>, we would get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And clearly, for this <EXPRESSION>, the natural variables are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there were other types of these functions that we construct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And by taking various derivatives of equilibrium functions with respect to each other, we can express other ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And via this methodology, we can relate to many different things to each other and have mathematical relations between physical observables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So following up on that, we then ask what are some other mathematical forms that we can look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And importantly, that told us that the intensive variables were not independent of each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you had relationship that you <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that was for a gas isotherm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the analogue of hydrostatic work for a gas was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12692, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "If you have <EXPRESSION> component, it goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we said that this gives us the relationship along an isotherm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll come back to that shortly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's start with our initial equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for simplicity, let's think of cases where we have a fixed number of particles so that we can write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12703, "label": "command", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "So this looks like this dF that I wrote before for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an example of the Maxwell relation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just to remind you, we can always invert these derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do I calculate that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> does not appear as a <EXPRESSION> derivative here, but certainly appears as a <EXPRESSION> derivative here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can look at the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I want to take a derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12668, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}, {"id": 12670, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "But I want the <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As I said, I don't really care what the name of these functions is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will get converted to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can get rid of the minus sign if I want, and I have the answer that I want.", "entities": [{"id": 12766, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 12768, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "And you can go and construct anything else that you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, I want to have <EXPRESSION> in the play, so now I have to add <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 12816, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "That's good, because I have <EXPRESSION> as a <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have <EXPRESSION> as a <EXPRESSION> derivative, whereas I want <EXPRESSION> to appear as the work element, something like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I will do is I will make this <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This converts this to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's fine, except that when I do things now, I would have calculated things at constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to calculate things at constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not really important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's my Maxwell relation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why didn't I get this result?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Did I make a mistake?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Louder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is this valid for extensive systems?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, this is valid for extensive system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used extensively in the relation of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, I never used extensivity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I have a system that I tell you its pressure and temperature, how is its volume related to the number of particles?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a box in this room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I tell you pressure and temperature are fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I make the box twice as big, number of particles, volume will go twice as big.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to apply extensivity, I would have to conclude that this is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, and I would be in agreement with what I had before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the constraint of constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, constraint of constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is important because we said that said there it is a kind of Gibbs-Duhem relation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that constraint is the <EXPRESSION> that tells me that once you have set <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which are the <EXPRESSION> variables that I have specified here, you also know m<EXPRESSION>u.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, you know all the intensive quantities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what's the condition that I used over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it is only so let me re-emphasize it this way I will write <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, only if I have <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I had here <EXPRESSION>, for example, I wouldn't be able to use this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was going to build this equation to say, look at the elements of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in particular, we had that for the certain changes that I won't repeat, the change in entropy to be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you are in equilibrium, you have this relationship between equilibrium state functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next item that we are going to look at is, what are the consequences of having underlying this equality between functions of state some kind of an inequality about certain things being possible and things not being possible?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that relates to stability conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I find it easier to again introduce to you these stability conditions by thinking of a mechanical analogue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's imagine that you have some kind of a spring, and that this spring has some kind of a potential energy that I will call phi as a function of the extension x.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that it's some non-linear function such as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is no reason why we should use a hook and spring, but something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we also discussed last time what happens if I were to pull on this with some force <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I pull on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to make it in the vertical direction, you can imagine this as being the potential energy of the mass that was pulling on the spring.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once essentially the kinetic energy has disappeared, my spring stops oscillating and goes to a particular value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And mathematically, that corresponds to subtracting a linear function from this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, what will it look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's not make this go flat, but go up in some linear fashion so that at least I can draw something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I need to do is to minimize this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But especially if you have a spring that has the kind of potential that I drew for you, you start increasing the so basically, what it says is that you end up at the place where the slope is = the derivative of the potential function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens if you start increasing this slope, if it is a non-linear type of thing, at some point you can see it's impossible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Essentially, it's like a very flat noodle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You pull on it too much and then it starts to expand forever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It only depends on the potential energy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says independent of the force that you apply.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this portion of the curve is in principle physically accessible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The portion that corresponds to essentially changing the curvature and going the other way, there's no way, there's no force that you can put that would be able to access those kinds of displacements.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there is this convexity condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you will have the potential energy as a function of many variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This matrix is positive definite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just <EXPRESSION> component that I have been focusing on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so ultimately, I'm going to try to generalize that to this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> thing that I don't quite like in this form is that I'm focusing too much on the displacements.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is written appropriately using this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have seen over here that whether or not I express things in terms of the displacements or in terms of entropy, temperature, conjugate forces, et cetera, these are all equivalent ways of describing the equilibrium system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to do a slight manipulation of this to make that symmetry between forces and displacements apparent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're related by this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if I were to make a change in <EXPRESSION>, there will be a change in the position of the equilibrium.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can get that by doing a corresponding cange in the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The corresponding change in the derivative is the <EXPRESSION> derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm saying is that this is a condition that relates the position to the forces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I make a slight change in the force, there will be a corresponding slight change in the position.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the changes in the position and the force given by this equilibrium condition are related by this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you can see that that sum is already present here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really, if you go back and I use this condition and do manipulations that are compatible to this, you will come up with exactly this stability condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have that in the notes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is somewhat more mathematically complicated than this, because the derivatives involve additional factors of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you have to do slightly more work, but you will ultimately come with the same expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You say, why is that of any use?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is possible that you've already seen a particular use of this expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's even be simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Look at the case where <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>, which means that I have a fixed amount of gas at a particular temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could have, for example, a box in this room which is in equilibrium at the same temperature as the temperature of the room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But its volume I'm allowed to adjust so that the pressure changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in that process, at a particular temperature, I will be finding a particular curve in the pressure volume space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This has to be a decreasing function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a curve where <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine, you say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nothing surprising about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it turns out that if you cool the gas, the shape of this isotherm can change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It can get started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there is a critical isotherm at which you see a condition such as this, where there's a point where the curve comes with <EXPRESSION> slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you say that for that particular critical isotherm occurring at <EXPRESSION>, if I were to make this expansion, the <EXPRESSION> term in this expansion is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You say, OK, let's continue and write down the <EXPRESSION> term <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the problem is that if I multiply this by <EXPRESSION> which would have made this into <EXPRESSION> I have a problem because delta V can be both positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can go <EXPRESSION> direction or the other direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a term that is a cubic can change sign can sometimes be positive, can sometimes be negative, depending on the sign of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is disallowed by this condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you say, OK, exactly what have you done here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What you have done here is you've drawn a curve that locally looks like a cubic with the appropriate sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you probably have used this for calculating critical points of van der Waals and other gases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will do that ourselves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That statement, in order to fully understand and appreciate, you have to come to next term, where we talk about phase transitions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Essentially, this stability condition tells you a lot of things about signs of response functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It wants to be contracted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly here, you are essentially compressing the gas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a thermal analogue of that sine which is worth making sure we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's look at the case where we have a fixed number of particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what we would have is that our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am free to choose any set of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The interesting set of variables well, OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I can take a look at this expression and choose any set of variables to express these changes in terms of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to choose for my variables temperature and xi.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I choose to use <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I substitute these <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in the general form of the stability condition to get constraints applicable to combinations involving <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So I have to multiply <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13009, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "I have to multiply <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"id": 13012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, <EXPRESSION> is not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then which <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that I have <EXPRESSION> that is a function of I have <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13020, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So here, I would have derivatives <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would have derivatives <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In both cases, <EXPRESSION> is kept fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, additionally, <EXPRESSION> is kept fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, additionally, <EXPRESSION> is kept fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that multiplication.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We multiply a <EXPRESSION> here and we get <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 13031, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "So what I will do is I will look at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to turn this into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION> = what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's taking the things in this fashion, which is <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can see that the sum total of these <EXPRESSION> terms is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly what I have here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this for any choice of <EXPRESSION>'s and <EXPRESSION>'s for any choice, it better be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in particular, given this nice form that I have over here, I can certainly choose all of the delta <EXPRESSION>'s to be <EXPRESSION>, because I do things at constant displacement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what I have is that the whole thing is proportional to delta T squared and some coefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So entropy should always be an increasing function of temperature at constant displacement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the consequence of that is that heat capacities measure at constant displacement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The general definition is you put some amount of heat into the system at constant displacement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to specify the procedure by which heat is applied to the system and see how much this temperature changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can in principle do this sufficiently stability so I can measure precisely the changes in temperature infinitesimally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION> is precisely the entity that we have looked at to be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in the same way that a spring is stable if you pull on it, its extension should increase a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the coefficient that relates the change in displacement corresponding to the change in force has to be positive for stability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Heat capacities must have this positivity in the sense that if you add heat to a system, its temperature should go up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It it went the other way, it would actually also violate the <EXPRESSION> law of thermodynamics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm a bit confused about the <EXPRESSION> notation that we used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The initial equation that we start has only it deals with <EXPRESSION>, but where does <EXPRESSION> come from?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Up here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So index <EXPRESSION> is just a dummy variable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <EQUATION> <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's start from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And part of the confusion is that I'm not really consistent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I meant here is that there may be multiple ways of doing work on the system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there could be pressure, there could be spring, there could be magnetic work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I do mechanical work on the system, the change in energy is the sum total of all different ways to do mechanical works, plus the heat that is supplied to the system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to add all of these things together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I'm again inconsistent, this is really what I mean, that when you do a change in a function of multiple variables, you would write it as <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13091, "label": "command", "start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 142}]}
{"text": "If you use the summation convention, I have to really sum over all possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> of the derivatives here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I took another derivative, or I looked at the change in this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This function depends also on variables <EXPRESSION> through <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to look at the sum over all changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that automatically, I have kind of assumed some of these things as I write things rapidly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if it is not clear, you have to spend a little bit of time writing things more in detail, because it's after all kind of simple algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, did I make another mistake?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, not a mistake, just Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you were talking about mechanicals, you had a non-linear spring.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You start pulling on it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At some point, it just increases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it is a non-linear spring, yes, that's right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can you provide example of thermodynamic system which, upon some threshold action upon it, becomes unstable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I more or less had that example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to develop it a little bit further.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I said that typically, if I look at the pressure volume isotherms of a gas, it looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I told you that there is actually some kind of a critical isotherm that looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you may ask, well, what do things look below that for lower temperatures?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, you probably know this, is that this is the temperature below which you have a transition to liquid gas coexistence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the isotherms would look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it turns out that while these are true equilibrium things you would have to wait sufficiently long so that the system explores these isotherms it is also possible in certain systems to do things a little bit more rapidly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you go below, you will see a kind of remnant of that isotherm which kind of looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that isotherm would have portions of it that don't satisfy these conditions of stability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason that you still get some remnant of it not quite the entire thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get actually some portion here, some portion here is because you do things very rapidly and the system does not have time to explore the entire equilibrium.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But even the non-linear noodle, you cannot really see in equilibrium.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can only see it when you're pulling it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can see that it is being extended.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is no equilibrium that you can see that has that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I want to find an analogue of that non-linear noodle showing instability, I'd better find some near-equilibrium condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the near-equ", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now that we've spent some time thinking about what a differential equation is and even visualizing solutions to a differential equations using things like slope field, let's start seeing if we can actually solve differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As we'll see, different types of differential equations might require different techniques and some of them we might not be able to solve at all using analytic techniques.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'd have to resort to numeric techniques to estimate the solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's go to what I would argue as the simplest form of differential equation to solve and that's what's called a Separable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Separable differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that we have the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13103, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 13104, "label": "method", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "So we have this differential equation and we want to find the particular solution that goes through the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I encourage you to pause this and I'll give you a hint.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Perhaps you can find the particular solution to this differential equation that contains this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if you can't do it don't worry because we're about to work through it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I can multiply both sides times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13153, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 13154, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So I can multiply both sides times <EXPRESSION> that has the effect of putting the <EXPRESSION>s on the left hand side and then I can multiple both sides times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 13159, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 13160, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 118}, {"id": 13161, "label": "command", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 142}, {"id": 13162, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 143, "end_offset": 153}]}
{"text": "I can multiple both sides times <EXPRESSION> and we kind of treat, you can treat these differentials as you would treat a variable when you're manipulating it to essentially separate out the variables.", "entities": [{"id": 13164, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 13165, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And so, this will cancel with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we are left with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually let me write it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13171, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Actually, I might need a little more space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now why is this interesting?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we could integrate both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this also highlights why we call it the separable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You won't be able to do this with every differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You won't be able to algebraically separate the <EXPRESSION>s and <EXPRESSION>s on <EXPRESSION> side and the <EXPRESSION>s and <EXPRESSION>s on the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this <EXPRESSION> we were able to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's why this is called a separable differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hey, can I separate the <EXPRESSION>s and the <EXPRESSION>s and as I said, this is not going to be true of many, if not most differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now that we did this we can integrate both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'll find a nice color to integrate with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to integrate both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if you integrate the left hand side what do you get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get and remember, we're integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be <EXPRESSION> and we could put some constant there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you're integrating that that's going to be =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the right hand side we're integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if that was a <EXPRESSION> there and if you don't want to change the value of the integral you put the <EXPRESSION> right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The anti-derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> and then of course, I might have some other constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what can I do here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll have a constant on the left hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an arbitrary constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't used this initial condition yet we could call it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are both constants, arbitrary constants and we don't know what they are yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we could just rewrite this as on the left hand side we have <EXPRESSION> = on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 13208, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 29}, {"id": 13209, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "I'll write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13211, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Let me write that in blue just because I wrote it in blue before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now, this is kind of a general solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me separate it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was a part of this original expression right over here but using this initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it tells us when <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> needs to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we would have <EXPRESSION> which is just <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is gonna be <EXPRESSION> and just like that we're able to figure out if you subtract <EXPRESSION> from both sides <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13229, "label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 89}, {"id": 13230, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 118}]}
{"text": "So the relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> that goes through this point, we could just set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13234, "label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "So that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we are left with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we can multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION> and we're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 13241, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're gonna get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we can take the square root of both sides and you can say, well look, you know, <EXPRESSION> = this so <EXPRESSION> could be = the <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But they gave us an initial condition where <EXPRESSION> is actually positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're finding the particular solution that goes through this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this was a <EXPRESSION> then we would say <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> but we know that <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, it's the principal root right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me do that a little bit neater so we can get rid of, whoops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I thought I was writing in black.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can get rid of this right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're only going to be dealing with the positive square root so we could write <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> and that of course = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, today we get to move on from integral formulas and methods of integration back to some geometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is more or less going to lead into the kinds of tools you'll be using in multivariable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same as we did with Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the way that we're going to approximate this is by taking the straight lines between each of these points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As things get smaller and smaller, the straight line is going to be fairly close to the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the main idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just depict <EXPRESSION> little chunk of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, some increment there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I can figure out what the length of the orange segment is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the horizontal distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the vertical distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the formula is that the hypotenuse is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is approximately that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're saying is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's very close to the length of the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the whole idea of calculus is in the infinitesimal, this is exactly correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what's going to happen in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is the basis for calculating arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to rewrite that formula on the next board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to write it in the more customary fashion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've done this before, a certain amount.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I just want to emphasize it here because this handwriting is a little bit peculiar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I really mean is to put the parenthesis around it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we square it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for whatever reason people have gotten into the habit of omitting the parentheses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're just going to have to live with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And realize that this is not <EXPRESSION> or anything like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, this is a single number, and this is a single number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Infinitesimal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just the way that this idea here gets written in our notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the <EXPRESSION> time we're dealing with squares of infinitesimals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's just a little different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the form in which I always remember this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's put it in some brightly decorated form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is, as I say, the way I remember it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there are other ways of thinking of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's just write a couple of them down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is that you can factor out the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13300, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "So that looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I factored out the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13303, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So this is a variant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In practice, it's also very often written informally as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula for arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as I say, I remember it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you're going to have to derive various variants of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll have to use some arithmetic to get to various formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there will be more later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the question is, is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's just see what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, if <EQUATION>, which is an example which will come up in a few minutes, then <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whereas <EQUATION> =, if I differentiate this another time, it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they don't mean the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same thing over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see this <EXPRESSION>, this is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The quantity squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, this thing is supposed to mean the same as that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, you got a little nervous because I left out these limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, I did that on purpose because I didn't want to specify what was going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, if you write it in terms of another variable, you put that variable in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what we do when we change variables, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have many different choices for these limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the clue as to which variable we use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are not the same thing as <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION>, over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are mileage markers on the road.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when we measure arc length, remember it's mileage along the curved path.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, I need to give you some examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my <EXPRESSION> example is going to be really basic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I hope that it helps to give some perspective here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to take the example <EQUATION>, which is a linear function, a straight line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> would = <EXPRESSION>, and so <EXPRESSION> is going to be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "Which is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of the graph is going to be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which of course is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not very surprising.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just draw a picture of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is something which has slope <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this horizontal is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the vertical is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the dimensions of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula for the hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly the same as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you're saying duh, this is obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the point that I'm trying to make is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you can figure out these formulas for linear functions, calculus tells you how to do it for every function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we can break things up into these little infinitesimal bits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the whole idea of all of the methods that we had to set up integrals here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the main point of these integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so let's do something slightly more interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you like, that's the graph of a semicircle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe we'll set it up here this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that the semicircle goes around like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And well start it here at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll go over to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll take this little piece of the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So down to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the portion of the circle that I'm going to measure the length of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we know that length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to give it a name, I'm going to call it <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>'s the arc length along the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's figure out what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, in order to do this, I have to figure out what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you like, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's a calculation that we've done a number of times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to do it slightly faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have the derivative of what's inside the square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then there's also <EXPRESSION>, because in disguise it's really <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've done this calculation enough times that I'm not going to carry it out completely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want you to think about what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out to <EXPRESSION> up here, because the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 13381, "label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "And now the thing that we have to integrate is this arc length element, as it's called.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 13403, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And so I'm going to have to carry out the calculation, some messy calculation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to figure out what's under the square root sign over here in order to carry out this calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what this simplifies to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there is a little bit of simplification now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 13409, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So now I get to finish off the calculation by actually figuring out what the arc length is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have to take the square root of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I get here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, we recognize this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The antiderivative of this is something that we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the inverse sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Evaluated at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the equivalent statement here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's going on here is something that's just a little deeper than it looks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've just figured out a geometric interpretation of what's going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, that we went a distance alpha along this arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now remember that the radius here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this horizontal distance here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This distance here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the geometric interpretation of this is that this angle is <EXPRESSION> radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is consistent with our definition previously, our previous geometric definition of radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is really your <EXPRESSION> true definition of radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We never actually, people told you that radians were the arc length along this curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> time you're deriving it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> time you're seeing it correctly done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And furthermore, this is the <EXPRESSION> time you're seeing a correct definition of the sine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember we had this crazy way, we we defined the exponential function, then we had another way of defining the <EXPRESSION> function as an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we defined the exponential in terms of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is the same sort of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's really happening here is that if you want to know what radians are, you have to calculate this number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the next thing that gets defined is the sine afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the way the foundational approach actually works when you start from <EXPRESSION> principles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just seem to be missing but anyway what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to build this and we're going to see how far we can get with this next time.", "entities": []}

{"text": "I think now you're starting to see why the limit is a slightly different concept than just evaluating the function at that point because you have functions where, for whatever reason at a certain point, either the function might not be defined or the function kind of jumps up or down, but as you approach that point, you still approach a value different than the function at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, normally, this would be on this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let me graph <EXPRESSION> now.", "entities": [{"id": 345, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "But at <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we draw a little hole.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is approaching <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this will give you intuition for what a limit is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should it doesn't look completely right below it, but I think you got to get the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll see you in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's a slight variation on this expression right here.", "entities": []}

{"text": "See, this graph is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the way you write it is you say the limit oh, my color is on the wrong OK, let me use the pen and yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 360, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So, as you can see, as we go closer and closer and closer to <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> of whatever number that is approaches <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a gap in the graph, and then we keep and then after <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we keep moving on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you go from the right-hand side, you go along the curve, and <EXPRESSION> is also slowly approaching <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I go along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it essentially = <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is interesting because, in this case, the <EXPRESSION> does not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we look at let me at least draw a graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way I think about it is as you move on the curve closer and closer to the expression's value, what does the <EXPRESSION> =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to go this is how I visualize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll stay in this yellow color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's graph <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 373, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "This is actually right below this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's like an <EXPRESSION> curve like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is our new <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, for every value other than <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, you could actually cancel this and this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you very soon.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then I'll show you how to solve this analytical.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So, let's simplify the expression <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 396, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So let's do another problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Simplify <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 398, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll go with red.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we saw when <EQUATION>, it's undefined.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's undefined, right? So here's a case, just like what we saw in that first video, where the limit actually can't = what the expression = when you substitute <EXPRESSION> for the number you're trying to find the limit of because you get an undefined answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transpose <EXPRESSION> to the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 403, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 404, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "So, draw <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 406, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "Now my computer's breaking down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we keep going to the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EXPRESSION>, the graph is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>? Well, with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> comes from the left-hand side, what does <EXPRESSION> =? Well, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now that we hopefully have a little bit of an intuition of what a limit is, or finding the limit of a function is, let's do some problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll probably give you the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what happens when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And do we know what <EXPRESSION> is? Well, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? And you can also try what is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, since we're just starting with these limit problems, let me draw a graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw a line here so you don't get messed up with all of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's define <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 420, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So let's say that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 422, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So the first thing I would always try to do is just say what happens if I just stick x straight into this expression? What happens? Well, what's <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we're going to do the limit, we can just visually say, well, as x let me do another color now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, and then all of that is over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if, using the limit, we can come up with a better answer for what it's approaching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think this is going to give you the intuition for what we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So for every other value other than <EXPRESSION>, the value of this, of <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as long as this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> don't = <EXPRESSION>, it actually turns out that this function let's say this is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's say, <EQUATION>. I think here it might be useful to draw this graph of <EQUATION> because it'll give you a visual reason, a visual represent actually, let's do it both ways.", "entities": [{"id": 454, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "You actually just tend to ask what the limit is, and this is the way you could solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I draw a graph, these are the axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So clearly when <EQUATION>, we don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> until we get to exactly <EXPRESSION>, right? And similarly, when we go from the other hand, it's the exact same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some of these you might actually see on your exams or when you're actually trying to solve a general limit problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually another way that you could I mean, I often used to check my answers when I used to do it is you could take a calculator and try in what happens when: what is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm going to try to solve this, and in the very next video, I'm going to continue on with this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll actually see you in the next presentation while I figure out why my pen isn't working, and then we'll continue with this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But unless you're asked to, you tend not to be asked for a formal solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? Because what you want to do is you want to say, well, what does the <EXPRESSION> = when I get really close to <EXPRESSION>? And then you could keep going closer and closer to <EXPRESSION> and see what the <EXPRESSION> approaches, and in this case, you'll see that it approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so really, we see that <EQUATION> when <EXPRESSION> does not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me see, what's a good let's say my expression is I'll put it in parentheses so it's cleaner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how would we graph <EQUATION>? We showed that <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> does not = <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Isn't that the same thing as <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Substitute <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So there's a hole there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you'll see, and I'll make sure you see it visually here, that the <EQUATION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the denominator? <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to rewrite this <EXPRESSION> in a way that maybe I can simplify it.", "entities": [{"id": 487, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "Actually, I'll do the graphical and the analytical at the same time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something's wrong with my tool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say let's do it the picking-numbers method because I think that'll give you an intuition and maybe it'll help us draw the graph of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And evaluate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 490, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So let's say what is the limit once again, my pen is not working.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, you get positive <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, obviously you can't just put <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this graph, let's draw <EQUATION>, and if you have a graphing calculator, you should experiment, it looks something like this.", "entities": [{"id": 502, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So when you go from the left-hand side, <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I might actually do a separate presentation on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So from the negative side, it approaches <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 506, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "I don't know if you can see the <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you see, as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the negative direction, we get larger and larger or I guess you could say smaller and smaller negative numbers, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say <EQUATION>", "entities": [{"id": 512, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So in this situation, I'll draw the graph <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 514, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "And as we gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, it spikes up, and it goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because for the first time, <EXPRESSION> is a legitimate answer to your problem, which, I don't know, on some metaphysical level got me kind of excited.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> squared is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive direction, from the right-hand side, well, this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's write <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 525, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "But anyway, I will do more problems in the next presentation because you can never do enough limit problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say, just keeping that last problem we had in mind, <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as I approach <EQUATION> from this direction, right, from this direction, what happens?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get you know, if it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As we get to smaller and smaller as we get closer and closer to 0 from the negative side, it approaches infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, hopefully, my tool is working now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then as we see from what we drew, as we approach <EQUATION>, we asymptote, and we approach <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can just evaluate <EQUATION> yourself, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, so we were saying when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This notation just says the limit as I approach from the negative side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, from positive numbers, if you go out to the right really far, it approaches <EXPRESSION>, but it's still going to be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> is point the thing is frozen again when it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, so we're getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION> from the negative side, <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as you see, as you approach <EXPRESSION> from the negative direction, you get larger and larger negative values, or I guess smaller and smaller negative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is why I got excited when I first started learning limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the limit as <EXPRESSION> this pen, this pen the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, if I put if we say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 733, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "evaluate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 547, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "square both sides of <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 550, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So here, no matter what value we put into x, we get a positive value, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you go from the right-hand side, it also goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in a couple of presentations, I actually give you the formal, kind of rigorous mathematical definition of the limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can see this dark blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes to <EXPRESSION> as you approach <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you go from the positive direction, you get larger and larger values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So regardless of whether we put a negative or positive number here, we get a positive value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you put minus you could actually oh, let me do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, we could say that from the positive side, it's positive infinity, or from the negative side, it's negative infinity, but they have to = the same thing for this limit to be defined.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll be instructive, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "let us evaluate <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and if we put <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 558, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, you'd get <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, you could imagine the closer and closer you get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, when you go from the other direction, when you say what is when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the limit in general = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As we go from the positive side these are actually symmetric, although I didn't draw <EQUATION> that symmetric it also approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "square <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 571, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> gets really, really, really negative, as <EXPRESSION> is like <EXPRESSION>, this is approaching <EXPRESSION>, but it's still going to be a slightly negative number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, there you get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a case in which the limit oh, that's not too bright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You never quite get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do another problem, and I think this should be interesting now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So since I'm approaching a different value when I approach from one side or the other, this limit is actually undefined.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me graph <EQUATION> just to give you a sense of what this graph looks like because this is actually a good graph to know what it looks like just generally.", "entities": [{"id": 582, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So in this situation, you actually have as <EXPRESSION> approaches so let me give you a different notation, which you'll probably see eventually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see what if there is a limit here, you'll see what it's going to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to make these sweeping statements.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We still get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, usually we'd be done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My pen tool is malfunctioning again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you just substitute <EQUATION> in there.", "entities": [{"id": 587, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So it's interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do one more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to think about what happens as you get really large values of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this case, these don't matter anymore, and then these two <EXPRESSION> terms grow at the same pace, right? And they'll always be kind of growing in this ratio of <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's going to grow faster, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>? Well, yeah, <EXPRESSION> going to grow a lot faster than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Evaluate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 598, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "Well, now this is pretty easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I really encourage you, if you have a graphing calculator, graph these <EQUATION> that we're doing and see and show yourself visually that it's true, that the limit as you approach, say, <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> actually does approach the limits that were solving for.", "entities": [{"id": 602, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "I know that I kind of just hand waved, but that's really how you think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first thing I like to do whenever I see any of these limits problems is just substitute the number in and see if I get something that makes sense, and then we'd be done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know what you're thinking.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way you could do it is we divide <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 605, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in the denominator here, we set it to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 610, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 611, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "So you could prove it to yourself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the previous example, we saw that it evaluated out when you simplified <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>, and in this example, it came out to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the denominator, what's the fastest-growing term? Well, in the denominator, the fastest-growing term is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the limit here is actually that easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "let's say we have the <EQUATION>>.", "entities": [{"id": 617, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So that was interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that this is the same thing as that looks like it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we get a good number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "simplify <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "Cross out <EXPRESSION>", "entities": [{"id": 622, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "If the function is continuous, we'd be done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And make up your own problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, of course, it's very important to remember that this expression is <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we get the answer after we simplify <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 626, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "Well, let's define the numerator as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 628, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 629, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So that's the same thing as the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, well, that's a real number, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If they're the same term, then they kind of cancel out, and you say the limit approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Evaluate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 636, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "OK, let's replace the denominator with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 638, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 639, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "Hell, that's what I'm doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It actually looks like it's <EXPRESSION>, but we're just going to write <EXPRESSION>, which is, of course, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 643, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "See what happens when <EQUATION>, see what happens when <EQUATION>, and I think you'll get the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do one that I think is pretty interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could actually divide this rational expression <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>", "entities": [{"id": 648, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "Set the denominator to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 650, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 651, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So this denominator, as you get larger and larger and larger values of <EXPRESSION>, is going to grow a lot faster than that numerator.", "entities": []}

{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is always less than <EXPRESSION>, right? So any <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I draw <EQUATION>, it would have to be in between those two, right? So no matter how I draw <EQUATION>, if I were to draw <EQUATION>, it's bounded by those two functions just by definition.", "entities": [{"id": 986, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 987, "label": "command", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 91}, {"id": 988, "label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "So that's right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's not defined at that point, but the limit as we approach <EXPRESSION> also has to be at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to do that, one, because this is a super useful limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because once you understand what the squeeze theorem is, we can use the squeeze theorem to prove this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's keep that in the back of our mind, the squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't get it, maybe you just want to memorize this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we will use that to prove that the <EQUATION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "Squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll see in the next video that the squeeze theorem is tremendously useful when we're trying to prove this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this video I will prove to you that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now <EXPRESSION> could look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And none of these <EQUATION> actually have to even be defined at <EXPRESSION>, as long as these limits, this limit exists and this limit exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But before I do that, before I break into trigonometry, I'm going to go over another aspect of limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's also an important thing to keep in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe <EXPRESSION> doesn't have to be defined right there, but the limit as we approach it is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we have <EXPRESSION>, that's the point that we care about.", "entities": [{"id": 1003, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "That's just the dependent access, and this is the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that's a very useful limit to know later on when we take the derivatives of trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I'm going to do it in the next video, since we're already pushing 8 minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And hopefully that makes a little bit of sense, and hopefully my calories example made a little bit of sense to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's draw <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So it has to go through that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me let me graph <EQUATION> for you.", "entities": [{"id": 1008, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So you can call it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's define <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1013, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "It's actually a pretty involved explanation, but I think you'll find it pretty neat and satisfying if you get it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or at least the limit = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does this tell us? <EXPRESSION> is always greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or at least it has to approach that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other thing is, sometimes you learn the squeeze theorem, you're like, oh, well that's obvious but when is it useful? And we'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the squeeze theorem? The squeeze theorem is my favorite theorem in mathematics, possibly because it has the word squeeze in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me graph <EQUATION>, and I'll do it in a different color.", "entities": [{"id": 1020, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "But when you invert both sides of <EQUATION>, you switch the inequality, right?", "entities": [{"id": 1021, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 1022, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And the same logic, in the first and fourth quadrants and that's where we're dealing with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the x-axis, something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's = so, just do this part right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always in between the dark blue and the light blue line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going from <EXPRESSION> all the way to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this triangle that I'm tracing in green what is the area of that triangle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I want to draw another right from that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you might feel we're getting close.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's a little bit bigger than the triangle we just figured out, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Draw a couple of more things, just to set up this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it would be = we could take this if we say that this is the right triangle, it would be this length the opposite of <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in another color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let me ask you a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this red line is always in between it, so it also approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is always positive, we can get rid of the absolute value signs there, and just write that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The green triangle the area of the green triangle so <EXPRESSION>, that's the area of the green triangle it's less than the area of this wedge.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's close enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase all of this down here now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the fourth quadrant, <EXPRESSION> is negative, <EXPRESSION> is negative, and the angle is negative, so <EXPRESSION> is also negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1036, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Let me see if I can graph <EQUATION> thing.", "entities": [{"id": 1038, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "Now when is this true?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this area right hand side is going to be = what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the unit circle, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it, and actually, we have to go with obviously, they got our trigonometry and it's actually a visual proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1040, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1041, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Just so you believe me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, back to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we said that <EXPRESSION> is always greater than <EXPRESSION>, which is always greater than <EXPRESSION>, between negative <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if this angle is <EXPRESSION> radians what fraction of that is out of the entire unit circle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll draw <EQUATION> like that.", "entities": [{"id": 1049, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So that first small triangle, that green triangle we did, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that may be the most obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might want to think about it a little bit, why it doesn't change anything in the second quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let me draw <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1056, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "Because this looks a lot like this, it's just inverted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this green triangle here, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That should erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This light blue line right here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EQUATION>, the radius is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1079, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "What's this base of this larger triangle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can't forget this though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm running out of space, so let me erase some of this stuff up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll trace it in green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write <EQUATION> down.", "entities": [{"id": 1064, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that hopefully gives you a little intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if that doesn't make sense to you, think about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, that's the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first let me pick a relatively small triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the area of this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the length of that line?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or another way of saying it, <EXPRESSION> = the left side over <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what's the adjacent length?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it should be clear just looking at this diagram, no matter where I drew this top line, that this green triangle has a smaller area than this wedge, which has a smaller area than this large triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is always going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this <EXPRESSION> right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're both less than the area of this large triangle, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's go like right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, expand <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we are using the squeeze theorem based on this and this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me ask you a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then right from this point, I want to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The right hand side = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1075, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 1076, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Let's see if we can play around with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do that in magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what's the height of it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take the absolute value of everything in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1081, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 1082, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 32}, {"id": 1083, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "So it's going to be a positive again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we are ready to use the squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let me ask you a slightly harder one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll show you the graph of <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1085, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Our formula is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And hopefully this makes sense to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's take the area of that larger triangle, of this big triangle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted to do it right from this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Will there ever be a time when <EXPRESSION> is in the first or the fourth quadrant is there ever a time that <EXPRESSION> is a negative expression?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you go negative, as long as we take the absolute value, then the distance will still hold and we still have positive areas and all that kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This blue line right here, that's the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is the area of not that green triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, between <EXPRESSION>, or the fourth and the first quadrants, the red line is always in between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right hand side is going to be = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1093, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 1094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "Well, first of all, what happens when you invert <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 1096, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "Let's see, let me see if I can I should draw <EQUATION> pretty big.", "entities": [{"id": 1098, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "Now, let's think about the area of a couple of parts of this figure that I've drawn here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That another way to view it, as this line gets smaller and smaller as it approaches <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, that this area and this area converge, so the area in between kind of has to converge to the both of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, we are ready to use the squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the slightly larger area of this wedge is we figured out just now is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is less than the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can see that I actually typed it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now that we have hopefully a decent understanding of the squeeze theorem, we'll use that to prove that the limit I'll do it in yellow the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the limit, as this light blue line approaches <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> and as you get, you know, it's a continuous function so the limit is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's call this length over here, let's call this o for opposite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's the area of that green triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Get the absolute value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1114, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 1115, "label": "method", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So to get to this, let's invert <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So we have this inequality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area of the entire circle is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "TOA.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tells us what fraction we are of the circle, and we're going to want to multiply that times the area of the whole circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the absolute value of both sides of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's easy, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the define <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1121, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So we could erase everything that took us so far.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we are ready to go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's go back to our SOHCAHTOA definition of tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since we know that the absolute value of <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, we know that these less than signs don't change, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is <EXPRESSION> ever negative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there are <EXPRESSION> radians in a total unit circle, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>, so the area of the circle so the area of this wedge right here, is just going to be = these <EXPRESSION> cancel out it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Left hand side = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1133, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 1134, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So the distance from here to here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to run out of space, so let me draw an <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "What is tangent?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nope, that doesn't erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we just figured out that this height right here, that this height is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw <EQUATION> a well, it is a radius, but I'm going to go beyond the unit circle.", "entities": [{"id": 1140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "And this is the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a circle with a radius of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel <EXPRESSION> from both sides in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1147, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And so this is just an intuition of what happens with the squeeze theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, if I say <EQUATION>, and I invert both sides of <EQUATION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1151, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 43}, {"id": 1152, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "Well, in the first quadrant, <EXPRESSION> is positive, and <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's just a radius again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And simplify <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1156, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "But we can figure out the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's divide both sides by the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1159, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 1160, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And if you want to see it graphically, I've graphed it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's kind of the fraction that this is of you know, if you did it in degrees the <EXPRESSION> that this is over <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say the right hand side = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1166, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 1167, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So the opposite side, this right side is going to be = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1169, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}, {"id": 1170, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "And you know, you could say that that's the same thing as the absolute value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the x-axis, would look something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do this triangle right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now if this is an angle <EXPRESSION> in radians, what's the length of this line right here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always going to be a little bit bigger, because it includes this area between that triangle and the arc, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope you see well, that's not a different enough color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is always going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then let me draw the <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1178, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And then what is the limit, as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's this length right here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully that gave you the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in the fourth quadrant, <EXPRESSION> is going to be a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're in the fourth and first quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the absolute value signs are kind of redundant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This gives a lot of space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is less than what's the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, and it has <EXPRESSION> sides, a left, middle, and right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I'm going there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to invert it, what happens?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope I haven't confused you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is that right there is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As long as we're in the first quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did I say?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope I didn't confuse you by taking the absolute value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's the unit circle, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EQUATION>, this <EXPRESSION>, is in between the two.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you must be bubbling over with anticipation now, because I've said this so many times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in oh, I'll do it in red.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should have drawn it a little bigger, but I think we'll be able to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're dealing with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should draw <EQUATION> like quite big.", "entities": [{"id": 1194, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that shouldn't change anything, especially if you're in the first quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know the limit as this top dark blue line approaches <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get absolute value of <EXPRESSION>, which is less than the absolute value of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1203, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 1204, "label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Well, the <EQUATION> is always = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is true as long as we're in the first quadrant, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if we take the absolute value of everything, it still holds in the fourth quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nope, that's not what I wanted to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this whole triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if that's the unit circle, what does it mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EQUATION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going on the arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the area of that arc?", "entities": []}

{"text": "So the distance from here to here that distance is also going to be <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have this inequality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's the area of the whole circle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you approach from the left-hand side, you approach <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1218, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "What do I mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in order for this limit to exist in order for this limit I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "You know, there's a little dirty secret about limits.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So how can we think about this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> was an <EXPRESSION>, it would be a simple problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's approaching from the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully that makes sense to you, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's figure out these two limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're probably going to get like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I've taken <EXPRESSION> minutes of your time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1236, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And why?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just we have an <EXPRESSION> instead of an <EXPRESSION>, but that doesn't make a difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's confirm that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that almost looks like <EXPRESSION>, but I have these squared terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it looks like this limit doesn't exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is approximate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Invert colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you've found it vaguely Useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This isn't going to change with the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well let's try to substitute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's take this case down here when we're approaching from the negative side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then slightly smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you were to take this out, you'd square the numerator, square the denominator, and you'd get this.", "entities": [{"id": 1245, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 1246, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 56}, {"id": 1247, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 64}, {"id": 1248, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "Well that's the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not a dirty secret, but in theory you should never get a limit problem wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how can we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me actually Let me see if I can Let me get the graphing calculator and confirm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make a substitution in magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So set this to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1250, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "And, once again, if you get this answer and you're not so sure, take your calculator out and try calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> here, that's going to make <EXPRESSION> approach <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Let me type it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We proved that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well actually you're at <EXPRESSION> the whole time on the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've been asked to do some more limit problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So set the right hand side = <EXPRESSION> right, I just took this out of the denominator and it flips, right, because it's <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1264, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1265, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "Now this looks almost like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't think you can see it yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, let's do another problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let us say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1267, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So essentially, we can say, well this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Substitue <EQUATION>", "entities": [{"id": 1270, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take that, you're going to get a number that's awfully close to this number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can take the limit within the base, I guess you could say, and get here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this has an absolute value, so you can't just directly manipulate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just a constant term, so we can take it out of the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to get a single variable here instead of a <EXPRESSION> times a variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well this is the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's substitute <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> and do this.", "entities": [{"id": 1280, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So we simplify <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 1282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So this is Is this right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Try numbers that are just slightly larger then whatever your limit number is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although it connects them and it makes you think the it somehow approaches here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the absolute value of <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> is a negative number?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that also means that So divide both sides by <EXPRESSION> and we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1288, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 39}, {"id": 1289, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be great if we could get it into that form and then we'd be done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION> squared?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could factor <EXPRESSION> out.", "entities": [{"id": 1292, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "Now this looks a lot like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well this <EXPRESSION> is This is a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this If we approach <EXPRESSION> from the left, we get some number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is what we have to solve for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So another way to rewrite this is <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well if we know we're approaching <EXPRESSION> from the positive side, what do we know about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well now this is interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because how do you deal with it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well you should be able to solve it analytically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Zoom out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am approaching a different number when I approach it from the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is positive, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this The base is the only thing that's going to change as I take as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I approached this function from the left-hand side or from the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what if we're able to get rid of this absolute value?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that = the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> from the positive side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the limit does not exist at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The absolute value of <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do another one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, just numerically, if you have a calculator, see what it's approaching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And sometimes you don't even need a calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see if we can simplify <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "Even the oh.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you don't know how to solve it analytically, just put it really really small numbers here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>> this one looks a lot like the previous one, although we have some exponents here of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means <EXPRESSION> Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as you see, as you approach from the right-hand side, you approach <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Change the denominator to its reciprocal", "entities": [{"id": 1316, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1317, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 1318, "label": "method", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we're dealing with negative numbers, then taking the absolute value of a negative number is the same thing as multiplying that negative number times the negative to essentially make it into a positive number, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'd get an answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what immediately confuses most people is this absolute value thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could take this <EXPRESSION> right, it's in the denominator out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could probably calculate this in your head with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's just because it picks points and just plots them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we set the right hand side = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1329, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 1330, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is positive, we can get rid of these absolute value signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what does it have here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide <EXPRESSION> by the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1338, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "What can I do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 1340, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "Graph <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "So let's do some more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could subtract <EXPRESSION> from this <EXPRESSION> and then divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1351, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 1352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "And now that looks an awful lot like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Simplify <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "Well that's just going to = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if they have the same answer, then we have the answer to our original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does it mean to take the slope of a curve now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw it in a different color.", "entities": [{"id": 1369, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well there is no slope for the entire curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if we go to a point back here, even though this is a really badly drawn graph, the slope would be something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My pen is malfunctioning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm going to ask you is, what is the slope of this curve?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But how can we figure out what the slope is when <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "At this point, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that <EXPRESSION> is this <EXPRESSION> coordinate, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we just use the standard slope formula, like before, we would say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "So let me draw that secant line <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1381, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "I think you're going to find that this is when math starts to become a lot more fun than it was just a few topics ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the slope at a given point would be the same as the slope of a tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next presentation ", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a curve, you're probably pretty familiar with it by now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we can take any continuous curve, or most continuous curves, and find the slope of that curve at an exact point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll know the exact slope at the instantaneous point along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example let me pick a green the slope at this point right here would be the same as the slope of this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Really, we just want to, if we want to find the slope of this tangent line, we just have to find the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we could try to do is, we could try to find the slope of a secant line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How are we going to figure out what the slope is at any point along the curve <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel out <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1386, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And of course this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Secant line looks something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another coordinate axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in general, if I have a straight line let me see if I can draw a straight line properly if I had a straight line that's my coordinate axes, which aren't straight this is a straight line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you know where I'm going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it just touches that curve, and at that exact point, they would have this blue curve, <EQUATION>, would have the same slope as this green line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this would be an approximation for what the slope is at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know it sounds very complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the slope of this secant line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in this line, the slope was the same throughout the whole line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is super useful, because for the first time, everything we've talked about to this point is the slope of a line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what we could try to do is figure out what the slope is at a given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how are we going to figure this out?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me try to redraw the curve <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1394, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "The slope would be a negative slope, and here it's a positive slope, but if we took a point here, the slope would be even more positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1396, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1398, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And if you go really far out, it gets extremely steep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we want to get the slope of the tangent line, we would just have to find what happens as <EXPRESSION> gets smaller and smaller and smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then draw the slope <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1407, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Because this line is tangent to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well let's get started with our derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you look at this curve, doesn't the slope change, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So right now, we're saying that the slope between these two points, it would be the <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "The tangent slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For a line, there is a slope for the entire line, because the slope never changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We set the right side to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1414, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Well this is an easy limit problem, right? ", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the last presentation, I hopefully gave you a little bit of an intuition of what a derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> well that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the slope at that point? Well we now know the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this point here is of course <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a point along <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's simplify <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "When at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm also going to show you how to find the derivatives for a whole set of other functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if I were to draw let me pick a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's why we can get the instantaneous change at that point in the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to find the slope between these <EXPRESSION> points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll just take the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's pretty neat and I'll show you how in future presentations how we can apply this to physics and optimization problems and a whole other set of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't take my word on it on Lagrange.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this point right here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this point right here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And this = <EXPRESSION>, so ake the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is the denoted by <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do a separate module on physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that, right? So what we do is we take a point, maybe a little bit further along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide both numerator and denominator by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1435, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1436, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 1437, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "Let's apply it to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> coordinate, that's the <EXPRESSION> coordinate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we can divide the numerator and the denominator by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 1445, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}, {"id": 1446, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "Divide <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1449, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "So, we simplify the numerator.", "entities": [{"id": 1450, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 1451, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Whatever the <EXPRESSION> value is you just put into this <EXPRESSION> function or the derivative function, and you'll get the slope at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's really just a way to find the slope at a given point along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the right hand side becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1460, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}, {"id": 1461, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And I want to know what is the slope of this curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this was useful, but let's see if we can do more generalized version where we don't have to know ahead of time what point we want to find the slope at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Solve for the <EXPRESSION>? ", "entities": [{"id": 1465, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "Let's draw out <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 1467, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So if you actually did a traditional rise over run, the slope, this <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I keep it abstract as <EXPRESSION> because as you know we're going to take the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to say what is the slope when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me go up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Substitute <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> in the left hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 1474, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 1475, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "I just took the <EXPRESSION> and put it into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I really have to find a better tool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the slope at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know that the slope at any point of this is just going to be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> keeps freezing, I think it's too CPU intensive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the slope of <EXPRESSION>? ", "entities": []}

{"text": "But let me see if I can, let me get the graphing calculator here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know sounds complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2639, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "It's just the derivative operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, if you've got to know it, you've got to know it, and it tells you something else about the world, so it's interesting that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These lines should be parallel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this slope is my average velocity, and the way I drew it, there's probably <EXPRESSION> points, let's see, probably right around here, I was probably going <EXPRESSION> miles per hour, the slope is probably <EXPRESSION> there, the instantaneous velocity probably there, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what the mean values theorem says, is OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's figure out what point that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's begin with a bit of a review of the actual derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the derivative, because the derivative at <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2646, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 2647, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "The domain of this is actually all real numbers, I could put any number here, so obviously it's going to be defined over this interval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what can you say? You could say that my average velocity = just change in distance divided by change in times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the interval, <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> looks, like, right around there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can make it a little bit bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll let you think about that for a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in a blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you might want to experiment with it at different points in time, because it's going to be dependent on where we are and kind of what does the right triangle look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is some function <EXPRESSION>, and I'm going to put a few conditions on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is my y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I were to draw a line that has that average slope, it would look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That could be <EXPRESSION>, or who knows.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That'd be the run, right, and this would be the rise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, back to the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that in this video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does the mean value theorem say? Let me draw some axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the mean value theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what does differentiable mean? Differentiable means that at every point over the interval that we care about, you have to be able to find the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like, maybe, this point, right here? Just the way I drew it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this calls for magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could make it go through those <EXPRESSION> points, but it really doesn't have to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the run would be this distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, in this video I'm going to show you an example of a function that is continuous, but not differentiable and because of that, the mean value theorem breaks down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do a visual explanation first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if the function is continuous, continuous, continuous, and then it jumps, that disconnect, that would make this function discontinuous, or it would not be a continuous function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is going to the right, so it's change is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is very inexact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is there any point along this curve where the slope looks very similar to this average slope that we calculated? Well, sure, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means an interval for all the numbers between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but not including those.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would go like this, and it would start up here, go like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what else does that mean? Well, that means that if you were to graph the derivative of this function, that it is also continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know a lot of you probably get intimidated when you hear these words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means you can take the derivative of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the slope, the average slope between point a and point b? Well, slope is just rise over run, right? So what is it? Let me see if I can draw the average slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's going to be meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have mixed feelings about the mean value theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So back to the mean value theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean really this is kind of just the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> velocities of those different points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of neat, but what you'll see is, it might not be obvious to prove, but the intuition behind it's pretty obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, that is the classic rate of change problem the ladder problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully this video will clarify that little bit, and I'm curious to see what you think of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd write <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2676, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Unless, you know, you're doing limit problems, and they try to make these things break down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've gotten several requests to explain or teach the mean value theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I shouldn't have written it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know, you can think about it a little bit that at least at that point in time while the x-value is increasing at <EXPRESSION> meters per second, the y-value is moving even faster downward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If that was our y-axis, and that was our x-axis, just to give you the reference for what I drew.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So this would be an example of a function, let's say, same axes, let me draw it in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the point, right here, that's the point a, f of a.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this function meets all of these requirements.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means, it has to be defined at all of the <EXPRESSION> values from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, including <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? At least the way I drew it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's ignore that for now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, let's get back to the mean value theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when people talk about a closed interval, defined on a closed interval, that means that the function needs to be defined at every number between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and the function needs to be defined at <EXPRESSION> and at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> has to be continuous and differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It sounds like what a mathematician would say, and it sounds very abstract.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, the conditions are over a closed interval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is another very mathy term you'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does that mean? So we can look at it visually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's as good as any.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write it that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that point looks like the slope, you know, I could say the slope is something like that, right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Most of the functions we deal with satisfy all <EXPRESSION> of these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say I have some function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2714, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "If that was our <EXPRESSION> no, that's not a good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a function just has to be continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the average slope between a and b? Well, it's rise over run.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> I mean, you could whatever meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say this is <EXPRESSION>, right here, let me <EXPRESSION> right here.", "entities": [{"id": 2719, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Let's say that's be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw here a function that's not continuous.", "entities": [{"id": 2720, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So that's where that negative value comes from, because it has a negative velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a function that is not continuous would look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we don't know what, analytically, this function is, but visually, you could see that at this point <EXPRESSION>, the derivative, so I just picked that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it has to be continuous, differentiable, and let's say it's defined over the closed interval, and this is just the notation for it, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you know, hopefully, what continuous means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you might say, hey, why is there that minus there? Well it makes sense, because while the x-value, it's rate of change with respect to time, it's going in the positive direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you'll often say, on a closed interval from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it was an open interval, you would write it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All continuous means is that the curve is connected to itself as you go along it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what's happening to the y-value? The y-value, you could say its velocity is downward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's something to think about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the run, what's this distance? Well, it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2730, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "It gives a little bit more intuition why this really just is the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do the ladder in a different color still.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to time is <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the rate of change at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just doing it right below the line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times and this is what we're solving for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I just want to give you the intuition that if you were to put a roller here and put a roller there, that that's what a ladder would do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? This is <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then we can solve for the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the derivative of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully you're satisfied with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "= and we have to do it to both sides of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How fast is that moving down? Right? So how do we think about this? Well let's call this distance right here <EXPRESSION>, because it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're <EXPRESSION> meters away, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you get the change in <EXPRESSION> with respect to time = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? At that point it would either stop, but if someone's pulling it then it could continue to go at <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this entire expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Subtract <EXPRESSION> from both sides, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2752, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 2753, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do we know y? Well, I think we do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I want to figure out is the rate of change of this point of the ladder, the top point of the ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How much does <EXPRESSION> move in a very small amount of time? And what are we looking for? We're looking for how fast is this y-value moving downward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just substitute the values.", "entities": [{"id": 2760, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So this right here describes, if you've watched the video on implicit functions or implicit differentiation, this is kind of an implicit function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what do we know? We know <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just draw it really messy real quick on this side.", "entities": [{"id": 2764, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So we know <EXPRESSION>, we know the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> versus time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would slide down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? Or an implicit function of <EXPRESSION>, really.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This point right here is moving to the right at <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? If we take this <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So my question to you is, what is the rate of change of this point of the kind of top of the ladder what is its rate of change downwards when the left point of the ladder right here is going to the left at <EXPRESSION> meters per second, and this distance right here let me do it in a different color is <EXPRESSION> meters? Actually, let me do the mirror image of that, just because I don't want to use negative numbers and all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, we've actually already drawn that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just realized that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then we can simplify up here.", "entities": [{"id": 2774, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So let's take the derivative with respect to time of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2776, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 2777, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "That was given in the problem <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>? Well, we could just use this formula right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me erase my woops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, but we know that we're only dealing with positive values at least in this example right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of the horizontal displacement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what can we do now? Well, we're dealing with rates of change with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the greatest common factor? I think it's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the change in <EXPRESSION> with respect to time at this moment in time? It's <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me erase some stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the rate of <EXPRESSION> with respect to time, well it never changes so it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I tend to try to crowd too much into <EXPRESSION> window, making things confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's call this distance up here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the ground, that's the wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why I did that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's essentially what the question is asking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? We know <EXPRESSION> is what? <EXPRESSION> is, at this point in time, <EXPRESSION> meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So at any given point in time, how does <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> relate? Well, this is a right angle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? This point would go down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times the change in so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just figured out that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you found this to be a little confusing you might want to watch the video that we actually just did on implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then how much does <EXPRESSION> change with respect to time? Well, this <EXPRESSION> value is never going to change, because, frankly, the length of the ladder is never going to change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION> = what? It's = the hypotenuse squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How fast is <EXPRESSION> changing as a function of time when <EXPRESSION> is changing at a function of time at <EXPRESSION> meters per second, and the value of <EQUATION> meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So we're looking for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, I'm going to do the horizontal component as <EXPRESSION>, and I wanted this to be a positive x-value instead of a negative x-value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But hopefully you get this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative with respect to time of <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's the chain rule.", "entities": [{"id": 2820, "label": "method", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "So what is this? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this point would go out to the left, until the ladder is in something like this position.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Until it is flat on the ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>? We're saying, well what is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to time when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>? So we get <EXPRESSION> that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? That's where that <EXPRESSION> comes from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I know that seems very complicated, but essentially all we do is we take the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that is good enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the rate of change, or this <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when it slides down, this point would go to the base of the floor right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that my ladder is <EXPRESSION> meters long.", "entities": [{"id": 2834, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So the bottom of this ladder is moving to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When this point right here is moving to the left at <EXPRESSION> meters per second, as long as we have some height here you know, at some point this whole thing is going to fall down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's too thin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I want to know is what is the rate at which the area that's kind of included by this ripple this entire area how fast is that changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have shown that, and visually, it shows that this is the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is my yellow wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the wall, this is the ground, that's a ladder leaning against the wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's think about a couple of things; what's happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we did that is we said, well, the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION> is on this green line as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we just used our algebra <EXPRESSION> skills to figure out the equation of that line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All we have to do to figure out the rate at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to time is we have to figure out the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The ladder, for whatever arbitrary reason, will just be sliding along the ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will do the ground in brown.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well we already know this piece, right? We already know the rate at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be an actual circle, which isn't what I drew, but close enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But before the latter completely falls to the ground, while this is being pulled out this way, this point right here is going to be coming down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? Think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's not by chance that that's also for radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can look it up on Wikipedia or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're not going to worry all about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is where I dropped the rock, and then this is a ripple in the pond.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we just have to solve for the y-intercept.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're just going to do the classic ladder problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the ripple is spreading out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me say that let's call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2844, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Well are we done yet? Well no, because we haven't substituted yet for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something even more interesting is to figure out what the antiderivative is of the area and compare that to the volume of a sphere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just <EXPRESSION> times the rate at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does a chain rule tell us? The chain rule tells us that the rate at which a changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> = the rate at which a changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> times the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe someone's pulling it or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get <EXPRESSION> = what's the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> here? Well that's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how did we do that? We knew the slope, because that's just the derivative at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we figured that out from the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we multiply out the units we would have gotten the same thing right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> meters, so <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say it's moving to the left at <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to give a side view of the ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that the ripple is moving out at <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm now going to actually do a couple more rates of change problems because I think the first <EXPRESSION> I did was probably a little bit more complicated than I wanted, and the hard part was actually the geometry and not the calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to figure out the rate at which area changes with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the ground, and then I have a yellow wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that for whatever reason I've kind of greased up this wall and the floor here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So going back to our original thing, we now know that the rate at which a changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> = the rate at which a changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well do we know any relation between the area of the circle essentially, and the distance of the ripple, or the radius? Well yes we do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that's probably what's causing it to slide to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is that? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or even compare that to the surface area of the sphere, and just keep picking derivatives and integrals and they'll be some pretty interesting relationships.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we figured out the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the rate at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> meters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm looking at it from the side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is mildly fascinating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When the ripple is let's say <EXPRESSION> meters from the center.", "entities": [{"id": 2879, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "r is the distance that the ripple is from the center from where it started from the get go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and it's meters squared per second, because it's the rate at which area square meters is changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> meters per second, we figured that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then leaning against that yellow wall and the ground, I have a ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the ripple spreads out it'll probably have multiple ripples, but let's just say we focus on <EXPRESSION> ripple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A thicker ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just right here, right? The rate at which a changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I figure I would do one, because it really is the classic rate of change problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in the next video i'm going to do a slightly harder rate of change problem just so that you see that it doesn't only apply to kind of purely geometric things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hope you found that vaguely useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next module.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so a normal ladder would just kind of stay where it is, but especially because this floor is all greased up, the bottom of this ladder is moving to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw.", "entities": [{"id": 2885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Let's say this is the ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the ladder rate of change problem? So let's say I have the ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's pretty interesting by itself that the rate at which the derivative of the area formula really is what? This formula by itself looks interesting, right? That's a formula for the circumference of a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually it'll do it at an accelerating rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> do it of both sides of <EXPRESSION> = the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When the ripple = <EXPRESSION> meters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It applies to pretty much anything that you can find a relationship between <EXPRESSION> values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of an area of a circle with respect to the radius is a circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw an arrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just say I drop a rock into a pond and it has a ripple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the rate at at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "r is not for ripple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> well I won't include the units because that might confuse you right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's part of any complete calculus education.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where am I going to draw my wall? This is the ground.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not to go on too far of a tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Back to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the point <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't like these <EXPRESSION>'s there, you could replace that with the number <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can substitute <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to know equation of the tangent line at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the product rules help us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the slope is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You may want to watch this again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, times the <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>, plus the first function, <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of the second function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the equation of the tangent line? It is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's substitute those points back in here, or this point back into this equation, and then solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2910, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 2911, "label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"text": "We say <EQUATION>, well, that's just = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 2914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> et cetera, and this would become <EXPRESSION> point something, and this would just be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this function is going to look something like, I actually graphed it, because it's not a trivial function to graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the equation of the tangent line? So let's go ahead and take this form, the equation's going to be <EXPRESSION> =, I'm just writing it in the, you know, not the point slope, the <EXPRESSION> form that you learned in algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's confirm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of this thing is going to be = the derivative of the first expression of the first function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's subtract <EXPRESSION> from both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 2921, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 2922, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> something centimeters per second is the rate at which the height of the water level is going to change as I put <EXPRESSION> centimeter cubed of volume into this cup per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we said, OK, the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We figured out the derivative, evaluated <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, right, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to do is figure out the equation of the line tangent to this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> point, this is <EXPRESSION> right here, the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> =, well, this looks like a job for the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're saying at the point, at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>, so at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're going to do, is we're going to solve it by figuring out its slope, which is just the derivative at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's worthwhile.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope at any point of this curve = the value of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we did here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can figure out what this number is, it's going to be like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It graphed it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just using a graphing calculator, and you can see, I just typed it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, this is what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative of this? So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let us graph this line.", "entities": [{"id": 2944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "I don't know if that helps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the derivative of this function at the point <EQUATION>, or at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>? So we just evaluate it.", "entities": [{"id": 2948, "label": "command", "start_offset": 128, "end_offset": 136}]}
{"text": "And by definition, the tangent line is going to go through that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what point? That's this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we know how to figure out the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, we know how to figure out the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and they're just multiplying by each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just get an intuition of what we're even looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just learned that here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I realize, I've never actually done that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope at when <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, the slope at that point = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me type it in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the point <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the point, <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what this is asking us, is ok.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we can figure out the y-intercept of this line, we are done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? And that's what I find so amazing about the number <EXPRESSION>, or the function <EXPRESSION>, is that the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the equation of the tangent line, its slope is going to be the derivative at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we solved the derivative of this function, and evaluated it at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this looks neater.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know, we could figure out what that number, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant number, but we write <EXPRESSION> because it's easier to write <EXPRESSION> than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the equation of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the derivative when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> whatever there, but we're not doing that, because this is cleaner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, = <EXPRESSION>, that's just the slope at that point, times <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the slope of the equation, or this is the slope of the curve when <EQUATION>, or at the point <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right, you can just substitute back into the original equation to get that.", "entities": [{"id": 2989, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "But if you look here, so this red, this is our original equation, <EXPRESSION>, that's this curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do a couple more videos with these rates of change problems because these tend to confuse people, but once you get the hang of it, I think you'll see that they're not so bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It might confuse you, because <EXPRESSION>, you'll say, oh, <EXPRESSION>, is that a variable? No, it's a number, remember, it's like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we use what we learned from algebra <EXPRESSION> to figure out its equation, and we'll graph it here, just to confirm that we actually figured out the equation of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's use this little graphing calculator to confirm that that really is the equation of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is going to be someplace up here, and actually, <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, right? Because <EXPRESSION> = what? <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that that line, that green line, I don't know if you can, maybe I need to make this bigger for it to show up, bolder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The point where we're trying to find the tangent line, right? So this point, <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>, this is where we want to find the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have to figure out the derivative at exactly this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that? Well, if we knew a <EXPRESSION> or an <EXPRESSION> where this equation goes through, we could then solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have probably confused you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, whatever, whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know a <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> that satisfies this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first thing we want to know is the slope of the tangent line, and that's just the derivative at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says, find the equation of the tangent line to the function <EQUATION> at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EQUATION>, or at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have figured out the equation of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> et cetera, and an infinite number of digits, so we just write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3017, "label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "So that's this part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Assuming that I've let's say <EXPRESSION> centimeters of water.", "entities": [{"id": 3019, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And there you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> times the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's where the water is in this cone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION> the height I just replaced it for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> centimeter cubed per second squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the volume of water that I put in the cone? Well, if you don't know it, and I sometimes well actually later when we do rotations of solid into integration modules I can actually prove this to you but the volume of a <EQUATION>, where the base is actually, you can kind of view it as the surface area of the water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It might not seem obvious but all we're doing is the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the volume assuming that the height is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we solve for <EXPRESSION> we get let me make sure not to confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're saying Sal, what have you now done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just kind of solid geometry review.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want you to think about this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I have a cone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So with that out of the way, let's use this to solve something kind of hopefully a little bit neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate at which the height of water is changing with respect to time is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the way I taught you, what's the change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well that's just <EXPRESSION> and what's the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative with respect to time of the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully this make sense to you that these are just <EXPRESSION> different ways of writing the chain rule.", "entities": [{"id": 3039, "label": "method", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 109}]}
{"text": "But if we figure it out, if we took the rate of change with respect to time off of both sides of this equation, something interesting might happen.", "entities": [{"id": 3040, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "And what's the radius in this case? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very interesting, Now let's start doing some calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that? This just give us a static picture of if we know the height we can figure out the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this part is just still see, I can rewrite in this new color <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the base? Well that's just = <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this actually makes sense just from a fractions point of view that this term and that term cancels out and you get, you know that this = that rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to know this is an interesting question how fast is the water level rising.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fascinating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I wrote is the traditional, but the way I've taught you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's our answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We said the height is <EXPRESSION> right then, so <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the top of the cup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I changed colors really for no reason.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How fast is <EXPRESSION> changing, the height of the water, at the moment when <EQUATION> centimeters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just complicated not complicated really just a little bit hairy solid geometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I could just rewrite this in the traditional chain rule format.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you know, it's a fixed cone, these are lines on both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 3055, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "So just to start off with some you maybe never even learned this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or <EXPRESSION> centimeters per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> something something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's then just solve that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take the derivative with respect time on both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 3058, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 3060, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 60}, {"id": 3061, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So can this solve the problem for us? Well what do we know? We know the rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the volume of let's say I'm filling water up to height <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that ratio stays fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will help us with the problem later on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you're saying Sal, this looks completely foreign to me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's say we're pouring <EXPRESSION> centimeter cubed per second into this cup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this is where the water line is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just for other frames of reference, but I like to stay in centimeters cubed per second because we're going to work with centimeters in multiple dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, you know, plus some other points, then we have the cheapest container to produce.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this example I said that the radius is <EXPRESSION> of the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just say that <EXPRESSION> actually is a function of <EXPRESSION>, which as you know it is.", "entities": [{"id": 3070, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "I'll change colors again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this isn't really the traditional.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> = the rate at which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to get rid of the units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say at any point in the clone the ratio of the radius of the cone to the height if this is the height, then the radius is <EXPRESSION> of height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this cancels out, and we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION> of those cups you have at the water cooler.", "entities": [{"id": 3077, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do is I'm going actually write this in a way that might be a bit foreign to you, but I think with a little bit of explanation you'll realize that this is the same thing as the chain rule that we all know and love.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we simplify that we get volume = let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for you metric jocks, you'll know sometimes doctors or nurses will say <EXPRESSION> cc, and that's also = <EXPRESSION> millimeter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to change colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think what was this, this is either Lagrange or Leibniz's notation, and this the other guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just dv/dt.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I am pouring water into this cup at a rate of <EXPRESSION> cubic centimeter per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get <EQUATION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't done any calculus yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said the rate of which the volume is changing with respect to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I forget.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> = the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know what <EXPRESSION> is right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> is the radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this might blow your mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Most physics instructors would cringe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one, you could think about what I just said and I think it'll make sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little confusing because I had no <EXPRESSION>'s in this equation before, and all of a sudden I'm picking a derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just start with a review of the chain rule, and I'm going to write in a different way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you found that vaguely useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I had the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3110, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "At any point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the chain rule up here.", "entities": [{"id": 3111, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "Sometimes I do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the derivative with respect to time of this side of the equation? Well it's the rate which <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, so we can just write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll tell you a little, you know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you need to review it, just rewind the video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We were able to solve that because they gave us constraint on the volume of the box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they already said that the volume is <EXPRESSION> meters cubed, so that gives us a good constraint.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me start drawing this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The length of its base is twice its width.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you understand all of this, so let me get rid of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've been sent another maximization or minimization problem, and this seemed to be an interesting twist on what we've already done, so let's do this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's its base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> times the area of the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Material for the sides costs $<EXPRESSION> per square meter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know that this is either going to be a maximum or a minimum, or at least a local maximum or minimum, or if you try another <EXPRESSION> and if it's greater, then you have a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, and this is a fun, non-hairy derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the cost of the material on the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's see what the cost of the material, the total cost of the material, is going to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just for fun, let's figure out what that is actually =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what's the area of each of these sides? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or the other thing is, well, you know, if there's only <EXPRESSION> critical point, and they ask you to find the cheapest container, that critical point is probably going to be the minimum point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A rectangular storage container with an open top is to have a volume of <EXPRESSION> meters cubed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right? So now we have to figure out this side here and that side over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me clear up some space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think we should be able to find a constraint on this, because we know what the volume has to be, right? It says, materials for the sides of cost $<EXPRESSION> per square meter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and so what do we get?", "entities": [{"id": 3134, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 3135, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So we want to set the derivative, to find the minimum or maximum point, at minimum or maximum point on the curve, the slope is <EXPRESSION>, so the derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do a couple things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The length of its base is twice its width.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this base right here, the material costs $<EXPRESSION> per square meter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the cost of materials for the cheapest such container.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, let's see what you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to make this too messy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I'll do it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can even say, as <EXPRESSION> = what?", "entities": [{"id": 3142, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And the first thing I would do is just, you could divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and you get <EQUATION> divided by <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3147, "label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 56}, {"id": 3148, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "It's a rectangular storage container with an open top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the minimum or maximum point are going to be where this = <EXPRESSION>, so let's set that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just the volume of a rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's <EXPRESSION> of these sides, I'm going to multiply them by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Length times width times height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "com, and let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's figure that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we want to add the cost of the material on the sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is, so we could write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the base, and if I call this the width, so this is <EXPRESSION>, the length is twice that, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I don't know, let's multiply both sides of this equation by <EXPRESSION>, so you get <EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, or we could just say <EXPRESSION>, whatever that could be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's simplify this.", "entities": [{"id": 3162, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the cost of putting the fabric, or the material, on this on this open rectangle, is, see, <EXPRESSION>, what's this, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, plus, let's see, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and so we can further simplify that as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First, let's figure out what the height is in terms of <EXPRESSION>, and then we can find an equation for the cost in terms of <EXPRESSION>, and then take the derivatives, and find the minimum, et cetera, et cetera.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could just say, we want <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3177, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And let me do it in a brown, maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have just solved that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see, let me do it a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the cost of the base? It's going to be area of the base times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we take this equation, we divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>, which =, we could say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3192, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 3193, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "If you see this in a class, or maybe you want to prove that for yourself on a test, but an easy way to test that is just, try some other <EXPRESSION>, right? We have the cost function right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you add <EXPRESSION> to both sides, you get <EQUATION>, or <EXPRESSION>, right? That's the same thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3199, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 3200, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "Actually, I like the drawing, but it's got to go, because I need the room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that has to = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where gets a little bit interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the surface area of the sides? Oh no, they tell the material for the base first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cost of the material.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the area of the base? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll actually go to google.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll do that in magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the cost, and it said it was an open top, so there's no there's no fabric we need for the top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, right? Base times height times width, whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we care about this side up in front, and then that side back there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The length of its base is twice the width, right? So this is the length of the base, this is the width.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And do we know that this is a minimum or a maximum point? Well, we could go and take the second derivative, and then confirm that we're concave upwards at this point, and then we would know that we are at a minimum point, and this is the cheapest such container.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the area?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're ready to just take the derivative and find out what the minimum point is of this curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Length times the width times the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's <EXPRESSION> sides that are <EXPRESSION>, this side and this side are the same size.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Try some other <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK? Material and then the height, for now, is unknown.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's <EXPRESSION> sides, and then what is it? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, to start out today we're going to finish up what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which has to do with partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I told you how to do partial fractions in several special cases and everybody was trying to figure out what the general picture was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'd like to lay that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll still only do it for an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it will be somehow a bigger example so that you can see what the general pattern is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial fractions, remember, is a method for breaking up so-called rational functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which are ratios of polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it shows you that you can always integrate them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's really the theme here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is what's reassuring is that it always works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's really the bottom line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's good because there are a lot of integrals that don't have formulas and these do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It always works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, maybe with lots of help.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe slowly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's a little bit of bad news, and I have to be totally honest and tell you what all the bad news is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Along with the good news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> step, which maybe I should be calling Step <EXPRESSION>, I had a Step <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> last time, is long division.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you do that by long division.", "entities": [{"id": 3218, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "And the quotient is easy to take the antiderivative of up because it's just a polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that you can do the next step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the next step which I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time, that's great imagination, it's right after Step <EXPRESSION>, Step <EXPRESSION> was to factor the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 3223, "label": "command", "start_offset": 150, "end_offset": 156}, {"id": 3224, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 161, "end_offset": 172}]}
{"text": "And I'm going to illustrate by example what the setup is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know maybe, we'll do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some polynomial here, maybe cube this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3226, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So here I've factored the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, here's the <EXPRESSION> piece of bad news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In reality, if somebody gave you a multiplied out degree, whatever polynomial here, you would be very hard pressed to factor it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A lot of them are extremely difficult to factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's something you would have to give to a machine to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's just basically a hard problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So obviously, we're only going to give you ones that you can do by hand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So very low degree examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just the way it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is really a hard step in disguise, in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, we're just going to take it as given.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's count up what its degree has to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is degree <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all together it's this, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this thing is of degree <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the way up to degree <EXPRESSION>, that's the possibilities for the numerator here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the extra information that I want to impart right now, is just this setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the setup is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it's going to take us a while to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this factor here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have another factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have another term, with the square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have another term with the cube.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have another term with the <EXPRESSION> power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what's going to happen whenever you have linear factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll have a collection of terms like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have <EXPRESSION> constants to take care of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, with a quadratic in the denominator, you need a linear function in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's, if you like, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> this quadratic term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I didn't show you last time was how you deal with higher powers of quadratic terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just the way you did in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then you're going to have to do the same thing with the next power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now notice, just as in the case of this top row, I have just a constant here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even though I increased the degree of the denominator I'm not increasing the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's staying just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not linear up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's better than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here it stayed a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here I stayed a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly here, even though I'm increasing the degree of the denominator, I'm leaving the numerator, the form of the numerator, alone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a linear factor and a linear factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the key to this pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have quite as jazzy a song on mine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is so long that it runs off the blackboard here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's continue it on the next.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've got this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I have room for it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to talk about this in just a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so here's the pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me just do a count of the number of unknowns we have here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION> is no coincidence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the degree of the polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the number of unknowns that we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the number of degrees of freedom in a polynomial of degree <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is a very complicated system of equations for unknowns.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the other bad news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll be able to evaluate this in no time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the only simplification of your previous method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't have a method for this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm just showing what the whole method looks like but really you'd have to have a machine to implement this once it gets to be any size at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an equation, there's this function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these things are known.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you cross-multiply on the other side, what you have is, well, it's <EXPRESSION>, if you cancel this denominator with that, you're going to get <EXPRESSION> the term for <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": [{"id": 3281, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 32}, {"id": 3282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 108}, {"id": 3283, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 125}, {"id": 3284, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "It's a monster equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's a good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you notice I didn't write it down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why didn't I write it down?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's incredibly long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, you probably, so how many pages of writing would this take?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is about a page of writing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just think of your machine, how much time you want to spend on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer is that you have to be realistic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're a human being, not a machine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so there's certain things that you can write down and other things you should attempt to write down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So do not do this at home.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It gets more and more complicated as time goes on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the pieces still need to be integrated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We simplified this problem, but we didn't get rid of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We still have the problem of integrating the pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, some of the pieces are very easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This top row here, the antiderivatives of these, you can just write down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By advanced guessing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is why I'm mentioning this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this kind of ingredient is something you already covered.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you do this <EXPRESSION> by advanced guessing, although you it as the method of substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You realize that it's going to be of the form <EXPRESSION>, roughly speaking.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're going to fix that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you differentiate it you get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION> this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the other piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it always works, but maybe slowly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, there's even another horrible thing that happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, if you handle this guy here, what's the technique.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is another technique that you learned, supposedly within the last few days.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Completing the square.", "entities": [{"id": 3336, "label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So this, it turns out, you have to rewrite it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the evaluation is going to be expressed in terms of, I'm going to jump to the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to turn out to be expressed in terms of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what will eventually show up in the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all of these things will be involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the last message that I have for you is just this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This thing is very complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're certainly never going to ask you to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you should just be aware that this level of complexity, we are absolutely stuck with in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason why we're stuck with it is that this is what the formulas look like in the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the answers look like this, the formulas have to be this complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate this, you get some ratio of polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the things that come up when you take antiderivatives of those rational functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're just stuck with these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so don't let it get to you too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it's not so bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, there are computer programs that will do this for you anytime you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you just have to be not intimidated by them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're like other functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's it for the general comments on partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're going to change subjects to our last technique.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this technique is called integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 3338, "label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "Please, just because its name sort of sounds like partial fractions, don't think it's the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's totally different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> is called integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 3340, "label": "method", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "Now, unlike the previous case, where I couldn't actually justify to you that the linear algebra always works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claimed it worked, but I wasn't able to prove it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a complicated theorem which I'm not able to do in this class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here I can explain to you what's going on with integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just the fundamental theorem of calculus, if you like, coupled with the product formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sort of unwound and read in reverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's how that works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take the product of <EXPRESSION> functions and you differentiate them, then we know that the product rule says that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm just going to rearrange in the following way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "That is, this term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is this term?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this other term, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus the other piece.", "entities": [{"id": 3346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "So I just rewrote this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to integrate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral of the left-hand side = the integral of the right-hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 3347, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 3348, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 72}, {"id": 3349, "label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 3350, "label": "method", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "Well when I integrate a derivative, of I get back the function itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the fundamental theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, I missed the <EXPRESSION>, which is important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I apologize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's put that in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the integration by parts formula.", "entities": [{"id": 3352, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "I'm going to write it <EXPRESSION> more time with the limits stuck in.", "entities": [{"id": 3354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "It's also written this way, when you have a definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just the same formula, written twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, now I'm going to show you how it works on a few examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to give you a flavor for how it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it'll grow as we get more and more experience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it looks like there's sort of nothing we can do with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we don't know what the solution is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, I claim that if we fit it into this form, we can figure out what the integral is relatively easily.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By some little magic of cancellation it happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> is a more manageable function than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we're using is that when we differentiate the function, it's getting nicer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's getting more tractable for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order for this to fit into this pattern, however, I need a function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what in the world am I going to put here for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, well, <EXPRESSION> is almost the right answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is that that makes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It makes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that this is <EXPRESSION>, but it's also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which was what I had on the left-hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 3372, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "So it's both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now all I'm going to do is read off what the formula says.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What it says is, this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is this and <EXPRESSION> is that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so that again, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except in the other order, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm integrating, and what do I have to integrate?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So look up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> with a <EXPRESSION> sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here is <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that <EXPRESSION> is easy to integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the integral of <EQUATION>, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the antiderivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so here's our answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our answer is that this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do <EXPRESSION> more slightly more complicated examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then really, the main thing is to get yourself used to this method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's no <EXPRESSION> way of doing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just practice makes perfect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we'll just do a few more examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And illustrate them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> example that I'm going to use is the integral of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is just slightly more recalcitrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I'm going to let <EXPRESSION> be <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3406, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "And again, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that matches up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll just see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not going to win us the whole battle, but it will get us started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Applying the chain rule.", "entities": [{"id": 3413, "label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And so the formula is that this is <EQUATION>, minus the integral of, well it's <EQUATION>, right, that's what I have to put over here.", "entities": [{"id": 3416, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 52}, {"id": 3417, "label": "method", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now, you notice something interesting happening here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just demarcate this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let you see what it is that I'm doing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So notice, this is the same integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've already solve that part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now know notice that the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 3423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "So we're back to the previous case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't win all the way, but actually we reduced ourselves to this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To the integral of <EXPRESSION>, which we already know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, I can copy that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, and then I have to throw in a constant, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the end of the problem here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this piece, I got from Example <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this illustrates a principle which is a little bit more complicated than just the <EXPRESSION> of integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is a little bit simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the example is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that way I can get all the way back down to the final answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same discussion as before, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the setup is similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have here <EXPRESSION> the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's <EXPRESSION> times, it turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And then there's a <EXPRESSION>, which cancel.", "entities": [{"id": 3446, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "So I'm going to explain this also abstractly a little bit just to show you what's happening here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you use the notation <EXPRESSION> is the integral of <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to forget the constant here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the relationship that we have here is that <EXPRESSION>, I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the <EXPRESSION> term over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times the preceding <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3454, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 3455, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the idea is that eventually we can get down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we can reduce to the <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the idea of a reduction formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> step would be to evaluate the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3473, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "Which is, if you like, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's very easy, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's applying this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just put it in a box here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the method of induction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm applying it for <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I plugged in <EQUATION> here.", "entities": [{"id": 3479, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So here, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what I put right here, on the right-hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 3481, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "And that's going to generate for me the formula that I want, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the answer to this problem over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was Example <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice I dropped the constants because I can add them in at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll put in parentheses here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what would happen at the end of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just summarizing what I did on that blackboard right up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same thing, but in much more compact notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3489, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "Again, this is box for <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I plug it in, what I'm getting here is <EQUATION> twice this stuff here.", "entities": [{"id": 3492, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 3493, "label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "Which is right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you like, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll leave the <EXPRESSION> off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how reduction formulas work in general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to give you <EXPRESSION> more example of a reduction formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I guess we have to call this Example <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's be fancy, let's make it the sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No no, no, let's be fancier still.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's make it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this would also work for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same sort of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I should mention that on your homework, you have to do it for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I decided to change my mind on the spur of the moment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In a later homework you'll even do this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You need the practice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so how am I going to do it this time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is again, a reduction formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's very important to pick which function is the <EXPRESSION> and which function is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the only decision you have to make if you're going to apply integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 3509, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}, {"id": 3510, "label": "method", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "How is it simpler?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's making progress for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, this function here is going to be what I'll use for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I differentiated that, if I did it the other way around and I differentiated that, I would just get the same level of complexity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Differentiating <EXPRESSION> just gives you back <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's boring.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't make any progress in this process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'm going to instead let <EXPRESSION> and, sorry this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3524, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "Make it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At least it isn't any worse when I went backwards like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, I have <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and now I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This again is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it happens that <EQUATION> so it's a little confusing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is the <EXPRESSION> we're calling <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now minus the integral and I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3537, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "And I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this recurrence is a new recurrence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me summarize it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's saying that <EXPRESSION> should be the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, I'm dropping the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the reduction formula is that <EXPRESSION> = this expression here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our reduction formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to illustrate this, if I take <EXPRESSION>, if you think about it for a <EXPRESSION> that's just, there's nothing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION>, that getting started at the real basement here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, as always, <EXPRESSION> is my favorite number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I always start with the easiest <EXPRESSION>, if possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a very, very fancy way of saying the following fact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll put it over on this other board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that the integral of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is this statement true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did that in my head.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I did was, I <EXPRESSION> wrote down the formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which was <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because there's an <EXPRESSION> in there, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I know the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is only by experience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You must get practice doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look in your textbook, you'll see hints as to what to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other hint that I want to say is that if you find that you have <EXPRESSION> factor in your expression which when you differentiate it, it gets easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when you antidifferentiate the other half, it doesn't get any worse, then that's when this method has a chance of helping.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there is there's no general thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The thing is, though, if you it with <EXPRESSION>, especially on <EXPRESSION>, those are examples where it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This power of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was <EXPRESSION>, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a mistake here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was thinking in the back of my head of the following formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is another <EXPRESSION> which we've just done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the types of formulas that you can get out of integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 3577, "label": "method", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "There's also another way of getting these, which I'm not going to say anything about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is called advance guessing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You guess in advance what the form is, you differentiate it and you check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That does work too, with many of these cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to give you an illustration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just because you these formulas are somewhat dry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to give you just at least <EXPRESSION> application.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're almost done with the idea of these formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to get back now to being able to handle lots more integrals than we could before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's satisfying is that now we can get numbers out instead of being stuck and hamstrung with only a few techniques.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have all of the techniques of integration that anybody has.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we can do pretty much anything we want that's possible to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's, if you like, an application that illustrates how integration by parts can be helpful.", "entities": [{"id": 3579, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "And we're going to find the volume of an exponential wine glass here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, don't try this at home, but.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be this beautiful guy here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what's it going to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This graph is going to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3581, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And the top, let's say, is <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3585, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So that the horizontal here, coming down, is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there are <EXPRESSION> ways to set up this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so there are <EXPRESSION> methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is also a good review because, of course, we did this in the last unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> methods are horizontal and vertical slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the <EXPRESSION> ways we can do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if we do it with, so let's start out with the horizontal ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this shape here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The whole thing evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3596, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And that is, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3599, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "Except there's a factor of <EXPRESSION> there, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Missed the <EXPRESSION> factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I subtract off, well, at <EXPRESSION> this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3605, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So it cancels.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's nothing left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we get to compare that with what happens if we do it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the vertical?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So by vertical slicing, we get shells.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that starts, that's in the <EXPRESSION> variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what are the shells?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bottom value is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay so I'd like to begin the <EXPRESSION> lecture by reminding you what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was our geometric point of view and we also did a couple of computations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We worked out that the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we also computed the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the nth power for <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we did last time, and today I want to finish up with other points of view on what a derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is extremely important, it's almost the most important thing I'll be saying in the class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you'll have to think about it again when you start over and start using calculus in the real world.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again we're talking about what is a derivative and this is just a continuation of last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, as I said last time, we talked about geometric interpretations, and today what we're gonna talk about is rate of change as an interpretation of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember we drew graphs of functions, <EQUATION> and we kept track of the change in <EXPRESSION> and here the change in <EXPRESSION>, let's say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then from this new point of view a rate of change, keeping track of the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> and the rate of change of <EXPRESSION>, it's the relative rate of change we're interested in, and that's <EXPRESSION> and that has another interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the average change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so that's the point of view that I'd like to discuss now and give you just a couple of examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get to use the example of this very building to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I'm cheating here, but there's a special case that's obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I didn't throw it in over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at the bottom, at that point of impact, we have <EQUATION> and so <EXPRESSION>, which is the derivative, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is why the police are there at midnight on Halloween to make sure you're all safe and also why when you come you have to be prepared to clean up afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So anyway that's what happens, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "An easy limit is something like the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And with this kind of limit all I have to do to evaluate it is to plug in <EQUATION> because, so what I get here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3663, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "And that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the end of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those are the easy limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> kind of limit - well so this isn't the only <EXPRESSION> kind of limit but I just want to point this out, it's very important - is that: derivatives are are always harder than this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can't get away with nothing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, why is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the formula for the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now notice that if you plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3671, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So it just basically never works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we always are going to need some cancellation to make sense out of the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can display it visually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does this mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EXPRESSION> is bigger than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that <EXPRESSION> has the minus sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just a little dyslexic and I hope you're not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I may have gotten that wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's much more convenient to have this extra bit of description of limits than to just consider limits from both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay so I want to give an example of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also an example of how you're going to think about these sorts of problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll take a function which has <EXPRESSION> different definitions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say it's <EXPRESSION>, when <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3691, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "So maybe put commas there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now draw <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3694, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "It's gonna be kind of a little small because I'm gonna try to fit it down in here, but maybe I'll put the axis down below.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today I want to get started by correcting a mistake that I made last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this was mistaken terminology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said that what we were computing, when we computed in this candy bar example, was energy and not heat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's both.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, energy, heat and work are all the same thing in physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was foolishly considering the much more - what am I trying to say - the intuitive feeling of heat as just being the same as temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in physics, usually heat is measured in calories and energy can be in lots of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, lifting some weight some distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these all have conversions between them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're all the same quantity, in different units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so these are the same quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Different units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's about as much physics as we'll do for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And sorry about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the example that I was starting to discuss last time and that I'm going to carry out today was this dartboard example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going over an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm really going to try to make them pretty realistic assumptions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, suppose you imagine, the question is, what does this left-hand side mean.", "entities": [{"id": 3731, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "That right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that the question that's you're asking?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I try to understand what the distribution of dartboard hits is, I should imagine my dartboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And very often there'll be a whole bunch of holes in some places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And fewer holes else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to figure out what the whole distribution of those marks is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so some places will have more hits on them and some places will have fewer hits on them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what I want to measure is, on average, the number of hits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's where this constant comes in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we're saying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, having discussed the setup, this is a pretty standard setup Oh, <EXPRESSION> more question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can answer this with an analogy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, the person hits rather rarely near the center.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not a ridiculous thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That actually happens a lot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> more question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that requires further justification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an interesting issue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's something which really has to be justified.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In certain circumstances it is justified.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So anyway, here's our part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be our chunk, for now, that we're going to estimate the importance, the relative importance, of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate that, you get a <EXPRESSION>, which cancels the minus sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're evaluating it at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So with the minus sign that's going to get reversed.", "entities": [{"id": 3749, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "So this is what our part gives us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, more technically, if you wanted to multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, it would be <EXPRESSION> times this.", "entities": [{"id": 3755, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 48}, {"id": 3756, "label": "command", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"text": "I'll say that in just a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now I want to work So, if you like, the part =, maybe even I'll call it <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3760, "label": "command", "start_offset": 90, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "That's what it really is if I put in this factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now there's no prejudice as to how many attempts we make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the most important <EXPRESSION> feature here of these kinds of modeling problems is, there is always some kind of idealization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the next thing that I want to discuss with you is the interpretation of the whole.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, what's the family of all possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this case, what I'm going to claim is that the reasonable way to think of the whole is it's that r can range all the way from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you may not like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So infinity is a really useful concept.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, it's nonsense in the context of the darts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you think of the basement wall where the kid might miss a target, he'd probably hit the wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So by doing this, I'm idealizing the problem but I'm actually making the numbers come out much more cleanly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is just always done in mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we did when we went from differences to differentials, to differentiation and infinitesimals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it makes things easier, not because it makes things harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's just see what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3777, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "Which is that negligibly small number, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this number is <EXPRESSION>, and this other number is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just <EXPRESSION> in the parentheses there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can tell you from these <EXPRESSION> numbers what the probability is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The probability that we landed on the target in a radius between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so that's this annulus here, is the ratio of the part to the whole.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which in this case just cancels the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the formula for the probability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's all gone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, again, let me just emphasize the way this formula is supposed to work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is some fraction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you like, it's a percent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This gives you the probability of the ring, but this is a very, very wide ring.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then going all the way out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this corresponds to everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This corresponds to a ring.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where do I want to go from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to make progress here, I still have to give you <EXPRESSION> more piece of information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is, again, supposed to be realistic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is between <EXPRESSION> o'clock and <EXPRESSION> o'clock.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this section is the part, the chunk that we want to see about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a, and then this distance here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the longest distance here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the longest distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of the probability that we're between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the number that we're looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we made a very, very bold assumption here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We assumed that this human being, who is actually standing The floor is about down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe he wasn't that tall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, so he's really a little bigger than this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the part of him that was close to the target covered about this section here, between radius <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you'll see, actually from the computation, because the likelihood drops off pretty quickly, whatever of him was standing outside there wouldn't have mattered anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're just worried about the part that's closest to the target here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I made it a clock.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I made it from <EXPRESSION> o'clock to <EXPRESSION> o'clock, so it's <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION> hours of a clock.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a way of me making a section that you can visibly see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, so here's what we're trying to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to figure this out, I need <EXPRESSION> more item.", "entities": []}
{"text": "here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I'll leave myself a little bit of room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to figure out something about what our information gave us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that the probability, sorry, this probability was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's remember what this is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3818, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "That's what's this probability is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "= <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which means that <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I'll use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to calculate this other probability here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the probability right up there is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's going to be the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we calculated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to use some of the arithmetic of exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's really <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the quantity is <EXPRESSION>, and then I bring that exponent out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> power, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this comes out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This part here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is actually why these tails, as you go out to infinity, don't really matter that much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a much smaller number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the probability of the whole band is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can answer the question up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is about <EXPRESSION>, or about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I stood there for <EXPRESSION> attempts, then my chances of getting hit were pretty high.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a typical example of a problem in probability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me just make <EXPRESSION> more connection with what we did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is connected to weighted averages or integrals over weights.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the weight that's involved in this problem was <EXPRESSION> = So let's just look at what happened in all of those integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happened in all the integrals was, we had this factor here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I include this <EXPRESSION>, it was really <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was the weight that we were using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The relative importance of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is not the same as the <EXPRESSION> that we started out with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is the <EXPRESSION>-dimensional histogram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that also connects with the question at the beginning, which had to do with this paradox, that it looks like these places in the middle are the most likely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's the plot <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3850, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "If you actually look at this plot here, you see that as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, it's going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a different graph here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, so this is what's happening really.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In terms of how likely it is that you'll get within a certain distance of the center of the target.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, it's not the area under that curve that we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's that volume of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to change subjects now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> more question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a question of which variable you're using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "According to pure radius, it's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out that there are some bands in radius which are more important, more likely for hits than others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It really has to do with the fact that the center, or the core, of the target is really tiny.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's harder to hit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whereas a whole band around the outside has a lot more area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Many, many ways to hit that band.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's a much larger area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a competition there between those <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to move on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to talk now about a different kind of weighted average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These weighted averages are going to be much simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they come up in what's called numerical integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are many, many methods of integrating numerically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're important because many, many integrals don't have formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you have to compute them with a calculator or a machine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They turned out to be incredibly inefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're lousy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next rule that I'm going to describe is a little improvement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called the trapezoidal rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unfortunately, it's actually also pretty lousy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's another rule which is just a slightly trickier rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's actually amazing that it exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's called Simpson's Rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> is actually pretty good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's clever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get started with these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way I'll get started is by reminding you what the Riemann sum is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a good review, because you need to know all <EXPRESSION> of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you're going to want to see them all laid out in parallel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have our graph, we have our function, it starts out at <EXPRESSION>, it ends up at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe goes on, but we're only paying attention to this interval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we split it up when we do Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, this is Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We go all the way over to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which are the step sizes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have these little steps of size <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, that's the point above <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3873, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "In order to figure out the area, you really need to know something about the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You need to be able to evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we've done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Enumerated <EXPRESSION> through <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And those are the numbers out of which we're going to get all of our approximations to the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So somehow we want average these numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our goal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our goal is to average, or add, I'm using average very loosely here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I was going to say add up these numbers to get an approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To average or add the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To get an approximation to the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which we know is the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's what the Riemann sum is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the following thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3881, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "And you multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3884, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> with left endpoints.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the left-hand sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's also a right <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, if you start at the right-hand ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although if they're curved, they miss by a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is called the trapezoidal rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a trapezoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this being a trapezoid, I can figure out its area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you think about if, you work out what happens when you do something with a straight line on top, like that, you'll get this average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the average height of the trapezoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to add up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3904, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the <EXPRESSION> trapezoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this keeps on going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at the end, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then last of all, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a very long formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to simplify it quite a bit in just a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's this =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, notice that I get <EXPRESSION> to start out with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, <EXPRESSION> got mentioned twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Each time with a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get a whole <EXPRESSION> in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same thing is going to be true of all the middle terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then, the last <EXPRESSION> is unmatched.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here is what's known as the trapezoidal rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'd like to compare it for you to the Riemann sums, which are sitting just to the left here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the left <EXPRESSION>, and here's the right <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you actually do it in practice, it's not very efficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although it's way better than a Riemann sum, it's still not good enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I need to describe to you the fancier rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now it always needs n to be even.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's delta <EXPRESSION>, and here's delta <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to study the area of this piece here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me focus just on that part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's reproduce it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course there are various heights.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They don't switch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They don't have inflection points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is a lousy, at this scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But when we get to a smaller scale, this becomes really fantastic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As an approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I need to tell you what the arithmetic is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to save time, it's on your problem set what the actual formula is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to tell you how to think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want you to think about it as follows.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area under the parabola is going to be a base times some kind of average height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the base here, you can already see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> delta <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The base is <EXPRESSION> delta <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the average height is weird.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it turns out to be the following formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has to be an average, but it's an interesting weighted average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was the punchline, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that they are such things as interesting weighted averages.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's still interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's supposed to be an average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it emphasizes the middle more than the sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a computation which is on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can put this together for the full Simpson's Rule formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I'll put up over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have here <EXPRESSION>, and we divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3960, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "And then we have <EXPRESSION> plus That's the <EXPRESSION> chunk.", "entities": [{"id": 3963, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "Now, the <EXPRESSION> chunk, maybe I'll just put it in here, starts This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it goes all the way to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next <EXPRESSION> involves the indices <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I'll get rid of these <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have too many <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's get rid of them here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take them out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put them out here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the way to the end, which is <EXPRESSION> sorry, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 3980, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "So here are all the chunks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what does this pattern come out to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This comes out to be the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then here I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "It keeps on going and keeps on going and keeps on going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the end it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this weird weighted average is way better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As I will show you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just trying to show you as many examples as possible of solving exact differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, trying to figure out whether the equations are exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if you know they're exact, how do you figure out the <EXPRESSION> and figure out the solution of the differential equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just the way it was written, this isn't superficially in that form that we want, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the form that we want?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're close.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How could we get this equation into this form?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just divide both sides of this equation by <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 4009, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 4010, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And then we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have written this in the form that we need, in this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we need to prove to ourselves that this is an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the partial of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> function, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was a plus here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be <EXPRESSION>, and then just a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be <EXPRESSION>, this would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we are dealing with an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we have to find <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the anti-derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> on both sides, and you get <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> because <EXPRESSION> is just a constant plus <EXPRESSION>, plus some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4057, "label": "command", "start_offset": 182, "end_offset": 186}, {"id": 4058, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 4059, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we know <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you take a derivative, when you take a partial with respect to just <EXPRESSION>, a pure function of just <EXPRESSION> would get lost.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's like the constant, when we <EXPRESSION> learned taking anti-derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, to figure out <EXPRESSION>, we just have to solve for <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well let's take the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4072, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 4073, "label": "method", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "That's going to be = this right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So The partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> this is <EXPRESSION>, is going to be able to what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be = our <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be able to this.", "entities": []}

{"text": "And then we're left with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anti-derivative so <EXPRESSION> = what is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could put <EXPRESSION> there, but the plus <EXPRESSION> merges later on when we solve the differential equation, so you don't have to worry about it too much.", "entities": [{"id": 4094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "So what is our function <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}

{"text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>, which we just solved for.", "entities": [{"id": 4103, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then they're could be <EXPRESSION> there, but you'll see that it doesn't matter much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I want to do something a little bit different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not just going to chug through the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to kind of go back to the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I don't want this to be completely mechanical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just show you what the derivative using what we knew before you even learned anything about the partial derivative chain rule what is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we just use our implicit differentiation skills.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just <EXPRESSION> prime, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION> prime.", "entities": [{"id": 4128, "label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is easy, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "Plus the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4133, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "Well let's take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4136, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 4137, "label": "method", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "We're just doing implicit differentiation of the chain rule.", "entities": [{"id": 4138, "label": "method", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "So this is plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "And then we're using the chain rule, so we took the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4142, "label": "method", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And then you have to multiply that times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Plus the derivative of this with respect to why is <EXPRESSION> times we're just doing the chain rule the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4150, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> prime.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to see if we can simplify this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this term, this term, and this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus let's just put the <EXPRESSION> outside <EXPRESSION> times let's see, you have a negative sign out here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 4158, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "So this is the derivative of our <EXPRESSION> as we solved it.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So this was our original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> just using implicit differentiation is exactly this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully this gives you a little intuition of why we can just rewrite this equation as the derivative with respect <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, which is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4173, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "Because this is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wrote out here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same thing this right here right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we take the anti-derivative of both sides, we know that the solution of this differential equation is that <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION> as the solution.", "entities": [{"id": 4180, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 4181, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 33}, {"id": 4182, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "And we know what <EXPRESSION> is, so we just set that = <EXPRESSION>, and we have the implicit we have a solution to the differential equation, I'll just define implicitly.", "entities": [{"id": 4186, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "So the solution you don't have to do this every time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This step right here you wouldn't have to do if you're taking a test, unless the teacher explicitly asked for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just wanted kind of make sure that you know what you're doing, that you're not just doing things completely mechanically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That you really see that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> really does give you we solved for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that's how we know that that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect <EQUATION>, because our original differential equation was = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take the anti-derivative of both sides of this, you get <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, is the solution of the differential equation.", "entities": [{"id": 4196, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 4197, "label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 4198, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 42}]}

{"text": "Our solution to the differential equation is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, minus <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>, is the implicitly defined solution of our original differential equation.", "entities": [{"id": 4209, "label": "command", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 103}, {"id": 4210, "label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 84}, {"id": 4211, "label": "command", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 122}, {"id": 4212, "label": "command", "start_offset": 157, "end_offset": 161}]}
{"text": "Anyway I've run out of time again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going on to the <EXPRESSION> unit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're getting started with Unit <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is our intro to integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's basically the <EXPRESSION> half of calculus after differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today what I'll talk about is what are known as definite integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, it looks like, are we missing a bunch of overhead lights?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is there a reason for that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hmm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Aah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's a little brighter now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the idea of definite integrals can be presented in a number of ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I will be consistent with the rest of the presentation in the course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to start with the geometric point of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the geometric point of view is, the problem we want to solve is to find the area under a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So keep that in mind that there's a lot going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are many different interpretations of what the integral is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so let's draw a picture here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have some curve here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I have in mind is to find this area here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, in order to do that, I need more information than just where we start and where we end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I also need the bottom and the top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have a notation for this, which is the notation using calculus for this as opposed to some geometric notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the following expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called an integral, but now it's going to have what are known as limits on it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we write in the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4224, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So this is what's known as a definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's interpreted geometrically as the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in order to understand what to do with this guy, I'm going to just describe very abstractly what we do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to compute this area, we're going to follow initially <EXPRESSION> steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of all, we're going to divide into rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing we're going to do is to add up the areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing we're going to do is to rectify this problem that we didn't actually hit the answer on the nose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That we were missing some pieces or were choosing some extra bits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we'll rectify that is by taking the limit as the rectangles get thin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Infinitesimally thin, very thin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Pictorially, again, that looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to chop it up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> I'm going to chop up the <EXPRESSION> axis into little increments.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to chop things up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll decide on some rectangle, maybe some staircase pattern here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I don't care so much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In some cases the rectangles overshoot; in some cases they're underneath.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the new area that I'm adding up is off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not quite the same as the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this region here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it includes these extra bits here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it's missing this little guy here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This little bit there is missing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, as I say, these little pieces up here, this a little bit up here is extra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why we're not really dividing up the region into rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're just taking rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're going to be negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Already, you can see it's kind of a thin piece of area, so we're not missing by much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as these get thinner and thinner, the problem goes away and we get the answer on the nose in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to do anything more complicated than <EXPRESSION> example, because this is a real labor here, what we're going to go through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to make things easier for myself, I'm going to start at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's draw the graph and start breaking things up.", "entities": [{"id": 4240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So here's the parabola, and there's this piece that we want, which is going to stop at this place, <EXPRESSION>, here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means, well, graphically, I'll just mark the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe there are going to be many of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, I'll make us this staircase pattern here, like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my choice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm overshooting with each rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have to write down formulas for what these areas are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's <EXPRESSION> big advantage that rectangles have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the starting place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that it's easy to find their areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the reason why we can get started with rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this case, these distances, I'm assuming that they're all =, equally spaced, intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll always be doing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the spacing, the bases, the base length, is always <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All = intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the base length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And next, I need the heights.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, my next job is to add up these areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I've already prepared that by finding out what the base and the height is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm sorry, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it just keeps on going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the last <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's very important to figure out what the general formula is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here we have a base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, this is a very complicated gadget.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <EXPRESSION> thing I want to do is simplify it and then I'm actually going to evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But actually I'm not going to evaluate it exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to evaluate the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Turns out, limits are always easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The point about calculus here is that these rectangles are hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the limiting value is an easy value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're heading for is the simple formula, as opposed to the complicated <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so the <EXPRESSION> thing I'm going to do is factor out all these <EXPRESSION> factors.", "entities": [{"id": 4289, "label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "As a common factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is everybody with me here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>, just to see that there's a general pattern here.", "entities": [{"id": 4305, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "Going to write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4308, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And let's put in the <EXPRESSION> here, why not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to use a trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This trick is not completely recommended, but I will say a lot more about that when we get through to the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to understand how big this quantity is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to use a geometric trick to draw a picture of this quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I'm going to build a pyramid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is, if you like, the top view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But perhaps we should also think in terms of a side view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the same picture, we're starting at n and we build up this layer here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're going to put a layer on top of it, which is a little shorter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to pile them up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we pile them up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the way to the top, which is just <EXPRESSION> giant block of stone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going backwards in the sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I have to build this whole thing up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get all the way up in this staircase pattern to this top block, up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the trick that you can use to estimate the size of this, and it's sufficient in the limit as n goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm ready to take the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look at what our goal is, we want to have an expression like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to This was the massive expression that we had.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I'm going to write it differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <EXPRESSION>, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4349, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 4350, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Alright, so the right thing to do is to divide what I had up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide by <EXPRESSION> in this set of inequalities there.", "entities": [{"id": 4352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And what I get here is <EXPRESSION> is less than <EXPRESSION> plus.", "entities": [{"id": 4355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, I claim we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this also goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the result from this whole computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, why did we leave the <EXPRESSION> out, for this step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a part of the answer is malice aforethought.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, we know what we're heading for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know, we understand, this quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's all <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This thing is a sum, which is growing larger and larger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not what's called a closed form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the thing that's not known, or not well understood, is how big is this quantity here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whereas, this is something that's quite easy to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we factor it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we analyze carefully the piece which we don't know yet, how big it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we discovered that it's very, very similar to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's more similar to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's almost identical to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This extra piece here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we match that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since this thing is very similar to <EXPRESSION> we cancel the <EXPRESSION> and we have our result.", "entities": [{"id": 4379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "Let me just mention that although this may seem odd, in fact this is what you always do if you analyze these kinds of sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You always factor out whatever you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you still are faced with a sum like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this will happen systematically, every time you're faced with such a sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now I want to say <EXPRESSION> more word about notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that this notation is an extreme nuisance here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's really sort of too large for us to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, mathematicians have a shorthand for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unfortunately, when you actually do a computation, you're going to end up with this collection of stuff anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want to just show you this summation notation in order to compress it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The idea of summation notation is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing tends The ideas are the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a capital sigma.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, this quantity here, for instance, is <EXPRESSION> times the sum <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4389, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 63}, {"id": 4390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "So that's what this thing =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the way the summation notation is used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a formula for each of these coefficients, each of these entries here, or summands.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this is just an abbreviation for what the sum is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the reason why I stuck in that <EXPRESSION> at the beginning, so that you could see that the pattern worked all the way down to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It isn't an exception to the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same as all of the others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, over here, in this board, we also had <EXPRESSION> of these extremely long sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> can be written in the following way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I hope you agree, this is rather hard to scan.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a way of abbreviating this massive formula into <EXPRESSION> which is just a lot shorter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the manipulation that I performed with it, which is to factor out this <EXPRESSION>, is something that I'm perfectly well allowed to do also over here.", "entities": [{"id": 4404, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "This is the distributive law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This, if I factor out <EXPRESSION>, I'm left with the sum, <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 4409, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So these notations make it a little bit more compact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we're dealing with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The conceptual phenomenon is still the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the mess is really still just hiding under the rug.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the notation is at least fits with fewer symbols, anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's continue here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've given you <EXPRESSION> calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to fit it into a pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the thing that I'd like to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do <EXPRESSION> more examples, but they're going to be much, much easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then things are going to get much easier from now on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> example is going to be the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I draw that, that's this function here, that's the line with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this area here is the same as the area of the triangle with <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EQUATION>, so this is the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We also know how to find the area of triangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, the formula is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> example Notice, by the way, I didn't have to do this elaborate summing to do that, because we happen to know this area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> example is going to be even easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By far the most important example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remarkably, when you get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, multivariable calculus, you will forget this calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somehow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't know why, but it happens to everybody.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the function is just horizontal, like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we stop it at <EXPRESSION>, then the area we're interested in is just this, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know that this is height <EXPRESSION>, so this is area is base, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's look now at the pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to look at the pattern of the function, and it's the area under the curve, which is this has this elaborate formula in terms of so this is just the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have <EXPRESSION>, which turned out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4439, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "And we have <EXPRESSION>, which turned out to be well, let me write them over just a bit more to give myself some room.", "entities": [{"id": 4441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4445, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And then we have <EXPRESSION>, which turned out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4450, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "So this, I claim, is suggestive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you can figure out the pattern, <EXPRESSION> way of making it a little clearer is to see that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the case, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you want to guess what happens when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, well if it's <EXPRESSION>, you do <EXPRESSION>; if it's <EXPRESSION>, you do <EXPRESSION>; if it's <EXPRESSION>, you do <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's reasonable to guess that this should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a reasonable guess, I would say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the strange thing is that in history, Archimedes figured out the area under a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was a long time ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was after the pyramids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And he used, actually, a much more complicated method than I just described here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And his method, which is just fantastically amazing, was so brilliant that it may have set back mathematics by <EXPRESSION> years.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because people were so it was so difficult that people couldn't see this pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And couldn't see that, actually, these kinds of calculations are easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they couldn't get to the cubic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even when they got to the cubic, they were struggling with everything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it wasn't until calculus fit everything together that people were able to make serious progress on calculating these areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Even though he was the expert on calculating areas and volumes, for his time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is really a great thing that we now can have easy methods of doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the main thing that I want to tell you is that's we will not have to labor to build pyramids to calculate all of these quantities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will have a way faster way of doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the slow, laborious way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will be able to do it so easily that it will happen as fast as you differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's coming up tomorrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want you to know that it's going to be However, we're going to go through just a little pain before we do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll just tell you <EXPRESSION> more piece of notation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need to have a little practice just to recognize how much savings we're going to make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But never again will you have to face elaborate geometric arguments like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just add a little bit of notation for definite integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this goes under the name of Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the general procedure for definite integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We divide it up into pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so here's our <EXPRESSION> and here's our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we're going to do is break it up into little pieces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to give a name to the increment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we divide up into these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how many pieces are there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it has to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will, for these Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there's only <EXPRESSION> bit of flexibility that we will allow ourselves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what that means is, let me just show it to you on the picture here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I go up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have the level, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the rectangle that I choose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I could've chosen some level in between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which would have meant that the staircase would've been quite a bit lower.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So any of these staircases will work perfectly well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're just going to add them all up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the sum of the areas of the rectangles, because this is the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This notation is supposed to be, now, very suggestive of the notation that Leibniz used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that in the limit, this becomes an integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that the <EXPRESSION> gets replaced by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4491, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "So this is what happens in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As the rectangles get thin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these gadgets are called Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is called a Riemann sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we already worked out an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This very complicated guy was an example of a Riemann sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll give you a chance to get used to it a little more when we do some numerical work at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last thing for today is, I promised you an example which was not an area example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to be able to show you that integrals can be interpreted as cumulative sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Integrals as cumulative sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so here's the way it goes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to consider a function <EXPRESSION>, we're going to consider a variable <EXPRESSION>, which is time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In years.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll consider a function <EXPRESSION>, which is in dollars per year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, this is a financial example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is going to be a borrowing rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It allows us to change variables, it allows this to be consistent with units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And allows us to develop meaningful formulas, which are consistent across the board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I want to emphasize the units in this when I set up this modeling problem here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you're borrowing money, let's say, every day.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's almost <EXPRESSION>, from the point of view of various purposes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how much you're borrowing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In each time increment you're borrowing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that you borrow your rate varies over the year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, sometimes you need more money sometimes you need less.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Certainly any business would be that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so here you are, you've got your money.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you're borrowing but the rate is varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so how much did you borrow?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here was your borrowing rate times this quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, dollars per year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is, if you like I want to emphasize the scaling that comes about here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have dollars per year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is this number of years.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that comes out to be in dollars.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This final amount.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the amount that you actually borrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you borrow this amount.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I want to add up how much you get you've borrowed in the entire year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which I'll just leave as delta t here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is total amount borrowed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is kind of a messy sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, your bank probably will keep track of it and they know how to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how much you spend, and how much you invest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the scale of <EXPRESSION>, it's probably <EXPRESSION>, it's probably enough for many purposes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, however, there's another thing that you would want to model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is equally important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is how much you borrowed, but there's also how much you owe the back at the end of the year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the amount that you owe the bank at the end of the year, I'm going to do it in a fancy way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's, the interest, we'll say, is compounded continuously.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> per year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, if you want to understand how much money you actually owe at the end of the year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the end of the year what you owe is, well, you borrowed these amounts here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now you owe more at the end of the year.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is what you have to add up, to see how much you owe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is essentially the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so when you start computing and thinking about what's the right strategy, you're faced with integrals of this type.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And see you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember to think about questions that you'll ask next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In today's lecture I want to develop several more formulas that will allow us to reach our goal of differentiating everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are derivative formulas, and they come in <EXPRESSION> flavors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> kind is specific, so some specific function we're giving the derivative of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that would be, for example, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the ones that we did a couple of lectures ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there are general formulas, and the general ones don't actually give you a formula for a specific function but tell you something like, if you take <EXPRESSION> functions and add them together, their derivative is the sum of the derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so these kinds of formulas are very useful, both the specific and the general kind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, we need both kinds for polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And more generally, pretty much any set of formulas that we give you, will give you a few functions to start out with and then you'll be able to generate lots more by these general formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So today, we wanna concentrate on the trig functions, and so we'll start out with some specific formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're going to be the formulas for the derivative of the sine function and the cosine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we'll spend the <EXPRESSION> part of the lecture on, and at the same time I hope to get you very used to dealing with trig functions, although that's something that you should think of as a gradual process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so in order to calculate these, I'm gonna start over here and just start the calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's check what happens with the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I take <EXPRESSION>, I subtract <EXPRESSION> and I divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4539, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 4540, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 64}, {"id": 4541, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Right, so this is the difference quotient and eventually I'm gonna have to take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's really only <EXPRESSION> thing we can do with this to simplify or change it, and that is to use the sum formula for the sine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> Oh, that's not what it is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4548, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So which is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, let's take a vote.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or is it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, you better remember these formulas, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, turns out that it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go, no gotta do <EXPRESSION> here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so now there's lots of places to get confused here, and you're gonna need to make sure you get it right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so we're gonna put those in parentheses here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now that's just the <EXPRESSION> part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just this part of the expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I still have to remember the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That comes at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I have to remember the denominator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so now.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna try to group the terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the difficulty with all such arguments is the following <EXPRESSION>: any tricky limit is basically <EXPRESSION> when you set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"text": "If I set <EQUATION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4575, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "So it's a <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we have various things which are <EXPRESSION> and various things which are non-<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We must group the terms so that a <EXPRESSION> stays over a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Otherwise, we're gonna have no hope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we get some <EXPRESSION> term, we'll get something meaningless in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claim that the right thing to do here is to notice, and I'll just point out this <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to use this common factor, and combine those terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is really the only thing you're gonna have to check in this particular calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now does anyone remember from last time what this thing goes to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How many people say <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How many people say <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my favorite number, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the easiest number to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this goes to <EXPRESSION>, and that's what happens as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, my <EXPRESSION> favorite number, almost as easy to deal with as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these things are picked for a reason.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the simplest numbers to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So altogether, this thing as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> goes to what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want a single person to answer, a brave volunteer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, back there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It cancels and this factor has a <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now I still wanna label these very important limit facts here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> we'll call <EXPRESSION>, and this <EXPRESSION> we're going to call <EXPRESSION>, because we haven't checked them yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I promised you I would do that, and I'll have to do that this time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're relying on those things being true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm gonna do the same thing with the cosine function, except in order to do it I'm gonna have to remember the sum rule for cosine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're gonna do almost the same calculation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna see that that will work out, but now you have to remember that <EQUATION>, no it's not <EXPRESSION>, because there are <EXPRESSION> different quantities here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so you'll have to be willing to call those forth at will right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do the <EXPRESSION> now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, there's the difference quotient for the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm gonna do the same thing I did before except I'm going to apply the <EXPRESSION> rule, that is the sum rule for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4622, "label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}, {"id": 4623, "label": "method", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 118}]}
{"text": "And that's gonna give me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to remember again to subtract the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4626, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "And now I'm going to regroup just the way I did before, and I get the common factor of <EXPRESSION> multiplying <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4629, "label": "command", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "And here I get the <EXPRESSION> but actually it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only difference is this minus sign which I stuck inside there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's not the only difference, but it's a crucial difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, again by <EXPRESSION> we get that this is <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the properties I called <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the result here as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION> is that we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this guy is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll put a little box around that too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, now these formulas take a little bit of getting used to, but before I do that I'm gonna explain to you the proofs of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll get ourselves started by mentioning that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe before I do that though, I want to show you how <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> fit into the proofs of these theorems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me just make some remarks here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just a remark but it's meant to help you to frame how these proofs worked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take the rate of change of <EXPRESSION>, so in other words this derivative at <EQUATION>, then by definition this is a certain limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So which <EXPRESSION> is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have to subtract <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4658, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "That's the base point, but that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4661, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And lo and behold you can see that this is exactly the limit that we had over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> that we know is <EXPRESSION> by what we call property <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, if I take the derivative of <EQUATION>, then that's going to be the limit as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be <EXPRESSION> by our property <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4671, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So that's really what this argument is showing us, is that we just need <EXPRESSION> rate of change at <EXPRESSION> place and then we work out all the rest of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's really the substance of this proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That of course really then shows that it boils down to showing what this rate of change is in these <EXPRESSION> cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now there's enough suspense that we want to make sure that we know that those answers are correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's demonstrate both of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll start with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to figure out property <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we only have <EXPRESSION> alternative as to a type of proof that we can give of this kind of result, and that's because we only have <EXPRESSION> way of describing sine and cosine functions, that is geometrically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have to give a geometric proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to write down a geometric proof we are going to have to draw a picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's draw a picture of what it is that we're going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here is the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's some little angle, well I'll draw it a little larger so it's visible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's theta, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I won't write that down on here but that's the unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now sin theta is this vertical distance here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe, I'll draw it in a different color so that we can see it all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK so here's this distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This distance is sin theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That little piece in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I'll use a different color for that to indicate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's orange and that's this little chunk there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now in order to persuade you now that the limit is what it's supposed to be, I'm going to extend the picture just a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so that you'll remember this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to take a theta angle below and I'll have another copy of <EXPRESSION> down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the total picture is really like a bow and its bow string there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we have here is a length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I'll write it this way, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4690, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "I just doubled it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here I have underneath, whoops, I got it backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Trying to be fancy with the colored chalk and I have it reversed here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the vertical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's try that again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you like, this is the bow and up here we have the bow string.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course we can cancel the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4697, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "That's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now why does this tend to <EXPRESSION> as theta goes to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's because as the angle theta gets very small, this curved piece looks more and more like a straight <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you get very, very close here the green segment and the orange segment would just merge.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They would be practically on top of each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they have closer and closer and closer to the same length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why this is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I'll articulate that by saying that short curves are nearly straight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so that's the principle that we're using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or short pieces of curves, if you like, are nearly straight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you like, this is the principle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So short pieces of curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I also need to give you a proof of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the property <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I want to interpret it as a length, I'm gonna want a positive quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna write down <EXPRESSION> here and then I'm gonna divide by <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": [{"id": 4706, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 4707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "Again I'm gonna make some kind of interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this time I'm going to draw the same sort of bow and arrow arrangement, but maybe I'll exaggerate it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the vertex of the sector, but we'll maybe make it a little longer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so here it is, and here was that middle line which was the unit Whoops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I think I'm going to have to tilt it up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let's try from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, well you know on your pencil and paper it will look better than it does on my blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here we are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's this shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this angle is supposed to be theta and this angle is another theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same as in the other picture, except we've exaggerated a bit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have this vertical line, which again I'm gonna draw in green, the bow string.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But notice that as the vertex gets farther and farther away, the curved line gets closer and closer to being a vertical line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's sort of the flip side, by expansion, of the zoom in principle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The principle that curves are nearly straight when you zoom in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you zoom out that would mean sending this vertex way, way out somewhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The curved line, the piece of the circle, gets more and more straight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let me show you where this numerator <EXPRESSION> is on this picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this whole distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the distance from the vertex to the green is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this little tiny, bitty segment here is basically the gap between the curve and the vertical segment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gap = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now you can see that as this point gets farther away, if this got sent off to the Stata Center, you would hardly be able to tell the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bow string would coincide with the bow and this little gap between the bow string and the bow would be tending to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the statement that this tends to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The scaled version of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In my strange analogy with zooming in, what I did was I zoomed out the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, if you imagine you're taking this and you're putting it under a microscope over here and you're looking at something where theta is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now because I want my picture, I expanded my picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the ratio is the thing that's preserved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I make it so that this gap is tiny.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me say this <EXPRESSION> more time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm afraid I've made life complicated for myself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want to keep on blowing up the picture so that I can see the difference between the vertical and the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's very much like if you are on a video screen and you zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, and zoom in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is what would that look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That has the same effect as sending this point out farther and farther in that direction, to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'm just trying to visualize it for you by leaving the <EXPRESSION> at this scale, but actually the scale of the picture is then changing when I do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So theta is going to <EXPRESSION>, but I I'm rescaling so that it's of a size that we can look at it, And then imagine what's happening to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, does that answer your question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the ratio of this little short thing to this longer thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is getting much, much shorter than this total length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're absolutely right that we're comparing <EXPRESSION> quantities which are going to <EXPRESSION>, but <EXPRESSION> of them is much smaller than the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the other case we compared <EXPRESSION> quantities which were both going to <EXPRESSION> and they both end up being about = in length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here the previous <EXPRESSION> was this green <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it's this little tiny bit here and it's way shorter than the <EXPRESSION> distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, I wrote minus that, that is I replaced <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4733, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "But then I wrote this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the negative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I show that this goes to <EXPRESSION>, it's the same as showing the other <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah, OK so this is a very important point, and in fact it's the very next point that I wanted to make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, notice that in this calculation it was very important that we used length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that means that the way that we're measuring theta, is in what are known as radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we measure them in degrees, for example, it would be completely wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The correct measure is the length along the unit circle, which is what radians are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is only true if we use radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, a little warning here, that this is in radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now here <EXPRESSION> is in radians.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The formulas are just wrong if you use other units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is that the relationship between this picture up here and this picture down here, is that I'm drawing a different shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, what I'm really imagining here is a much, much smaller theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm blowing that up in scale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this scale of this picture down here is very different from the scale of the picture up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if the angle is very, very, very small then <EXPRESSION> has to be very, very long in order for me to finish the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in other words, this length is <EXPRESSION> because that's what I'm insisting on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm claiming that that's how I define this circle, to be of unit radius.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me, let me take you through a couple of steps, because I think probably other people are also having trouble with this visualization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization I'm gonna try to demonstrate on this picture up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization is that I should think of a beak of a bird closing down, getting narrower and narrower.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, the angle theta has to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's the <EXPRESSION> step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the process that we're talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in order to draw that, once theta gets incredibly narrow, in order to depict that I have to blow the whole picture back up in order be able to see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Otherwise it just disappears on me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact in the limit <EQUATION>, it's meaningless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a flat line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the whole problem with these tricky limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's only just a little away that they're actually useful, that you get useful geometric information out of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're just a little away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's supposed to be that theta is open a tiny crack, just a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the smallest I can draw it on the board for you to visualize it is using the whole length of the blackboard here for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've opened a little tiny bit and by the time we get to the other end of the blackboard, of course it's fairly wide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this angle theta is a very small angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm trying to imagine what happens as this collapses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, when I imagine that I have to imagine a geometric interpretation of both the numerator and the denominator of this quantity here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I claimed the numerator is this little tiny bit over here and the denominator is actually half of this whole length here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the factor of <EXPRESSION> doesn't matter when you're seeing whether something tends to <EXPRESSION> or not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I claimed that if you stare at this, it's clear that this is much shorter than that vertical curve there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm claiming, so this is what you have to imagine, is this as it gets smaller and smaller and smaller still that has the same effect of this thing going way, way way, farther away and this vertical curve getting closer and closer and closer to the green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that the gap between them gets tiny and goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So not only does it go to <EXPRESSION> that's not enough for us, but it also goes to <EXPRESSION> faster than this theta goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I hope the evidence is pretty strong here because it's so tiny already at this stage.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are going to move forward and you'll have to ponder these things some other time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna give you an even harder thing to visualize now so be prepared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now, the next thing that I'd like to do is to give you a <EXPRESSION> proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it really is important, I think, to understand this particular fact more thoroughly and also to get a lot of practice with sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna give you a geometric proof of the formula for sine here, for the derivative of sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a geometric proof of this fact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is for all theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far we only did it for theta = <EXPRESSION> and now we're going to do it for all theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a different proof, but it uses exactly the same principles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I want do this by drawing another picture, and the picture is going to describe y, which is sin theta, which is if you like the vertical position of some circular motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm imagining that something is going around in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some particle is going around in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so here's the circle, here the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the unit distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And right now it happens to be at this location P.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe we'll put P a little over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the angle theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're going to move it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how far did we move it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well we moved it by an angle delta theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we started theta, theta is going to be fixed in this argument, and we're going to move a little bit delta theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're just gonna try to figure out how far the thing moved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in order to do that we've got to keep track of the height, the vertical displacement here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this distance here is the change in y.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the picture is we have something moving around a unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A point moving around a unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It moves from angle theta to angle theta plus delta theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's telling us the rate of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, well so let's just try to think a little bit about what this is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all, I've already said this and I'm going to repeat it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how far <EXPRESSION> moves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the change in <EXPRESSION> That's what I said up in the right hand corner there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, that's not a good idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to draw the diagram again <EXPRESSION> time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what I'd like to do is draw this curve here which is a piece of the arc of the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really what I want to keep in mind is something that I did also in all these other arguments.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, maybe I should have called this orange, that I'm gonna think of the straight line between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the straight line approximation to the curve that we're always interested in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the straight line is much simpler, because then we just have a triangle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact it's a right triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, so we have the geometry of a right triangle which is going to now let us do all of our calculations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That distance there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So next thing we need is the exponential distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've been talking about continuous distributions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We talked about the uniform and the normal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> famous continuous distributions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've already done all the discrete distributions we need for the entire semester.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we only have <EXPRESSION> continuous distributions, so we kinda have to catch up on the continuous stuff, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next most important <EXPRESSION> is called the exponential distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION> of the biggest topics for the next homework, and it's <EXPRESSION> of the most important distributions in general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we've already seen the exponential distribution, A couple of times, it's just like as part on the previous homework with waiting for the book to be released.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I used it to illustrate Universality of the Uniform, but we haven't formally introduced it yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this will be our formal introduction of exponential distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the traditional and I'm gonna call this a rate parameter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you don't have to call it lambda, it's just lambda's the usual terminology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm gonna call it a rate parameter, because intuitively we can think of it as the rate at which some type of event occurs, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what special about this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so we say <EXPRESSION> is exponential lambda, That's our notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's always positive, so continuous positive random variable, that's the PDF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see why it's called the exponential distribution, cuz there's an exponential function with a couple constants stuck in there, exponential decay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION> just integrating exponential, so that means it's valid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we can talk more about what are the special properties of this distribution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> = the integral, so I will start the integral at <EXPRESSION> because this is a positive random variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> up to <EXPRESSION> of lambda <EXPRESSION>, again that's a very easy integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will just get <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, for <EXPRESSION> greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's easy to check that this is correct, cuz if you take the derivative of this, lambda comes down and you get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you go that way, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And approaches <EXPRESSION>, if you go that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually an easier way to get the mean, of course we can just write down the integral and do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But before we do that it's useful to try to standardize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember what the normal, we can reduce any normal to a standard normal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're gonna show right now that if we let <EXPRESSION> =, <EXPRESSION>, Then we're gonna show that <EXPRESSION> is exponential of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4803, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "So that's kind of analagous to standardization of the standard normal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that we're multiplying, I mean it's not exactly the same cuz for the normal we subtracted the mean by a standard deviation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, we're just saying multiply by something to make it exponential of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if I can get exponential of <EXPRESSION>, it's gonna be a lot easier, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then if the lambda's are not there, so how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So since, let's just do a quick calculation to show that that's true, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cuz once we have this relationship, than a lot of the times we can just work with exponential of <EXPRESSION>, and then stick in the lambda when we need it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just compute the CDF of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4808, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> less than or = <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just this is an very easy calculation if you understand CDFs, that the CDF of <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION> is lambda <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we take the CDF and plug in <EXPRESSION>, then we just get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 4820, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the CDF of an exponential of <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just plugged in <EXPRESSION> here, and <EXPRESSION> cancel, okay?", "entities": [{"id": 4826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "So it's just that <EXPRESSION> short equation proves that his statement is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And find the mean and variance, and then we can get the general case, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that case now, so we're letting <EXPRESSION> be exponential of <EXPRESSION>, And we wanna find the mean and variance, Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get the mean <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just by definition, Expect the value <EXPRESSION>, so it's just the integral of <EXPRESSION> times the PDFF <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 4836, "label": "command", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"text": "Okay, now this is a very standard integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 4837, "label": "method", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "This is the kind of interval you'd see in AP calculus when you're learning integration by parts, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all we have to do is let <EQUATION> and let <EXPRESSION> = this part.", "entities": [{"id": 4840, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 4841, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "Remember your integration by parts, <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> and <EXPRESSION> = just integrate this thing, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm just gonna do a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> evaluated from <EXPRESSION> ero to <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's gonna be plus the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4853, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So now we've made it into an easy integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> part is <EXPRESSION>, because if we plug in <EQUATION>, we just get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4858, "label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "So the exponential part's dominant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this part is just <EXPRESSION>, and this part, it's just <EXPRESSION>, cuz that's an easy integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or an even cuter way to do it is to say, we're integrating the exponential <EXPRESSION> PDF it has to be <EXPRESSION>, otherwise that wasn't a valid PDF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this course, there are actually a lot of integrals, we can do not using calculus directly, but by recognizing that's a PDF or that kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course that's an easy integral anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, therefore the mean is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now for the variance, For the variance, we can just do <EXPRESSION> the other way as usual.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here is the LOTUS,<EXPRESSION> while by LOTUS, it's immediate of that integral of <EXPRESSION> this thing we just computed as <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this integer, well then we have to use integration by parts again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm not gonna write out the integration by parts again, probably because we're gonna learn better ways to do this later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or we're gonna actually avoid doing this, and get them movements a different way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is called the <EXPRESSION> moment by the way, <EXPRESSION> is called the <EXPRESSION> movement, that is called the <EXPRESSION> movement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, but this is an easy integration by parts in the sense that if let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4879, "label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "Basically it's gonna reduce reduce it back down in to an integral that looks like this, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's gonna lower the power from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, so this is like when you're doing integration by parts twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't actually have to do it twice, cuz you do it once and then you reduce it to the <EXPRESSION> we just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're actually doing integration by parts once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And wwe do that we also get <EXPRESSION> and that's pretty easy to remember, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now coming back to this general exponential, So just continuing the notation here, <EQUATION>, so <EQUATION> and that's gonna have, The mean, just take expected value of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Lambda is a constant that comes out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it has mean <EXPRESSION>, and it has variance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well for the variance, take the variance of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember the variance constant comes out squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, but the variance of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the variance is <EXPRESSION>d.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now we know the mean and the variance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We do not yet know why the exponential is important, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's different reasons why it's important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what I consider the most important reason is what's called the memory list property.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you've already seen the memory list property in the discrete case, if you did that practice mid-term question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we haven't talked about it in the continuous case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So memoryless property, So exponential distribution is memoryless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to tell you what that means, and then check that is true, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So memoryless property means that, See if we can remember that midterm practice problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is said something about memorylessness, it said no matter how long you've waited then it's like you're starting over from fresh, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's what it said, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says that if you have a random variable that, intuitively it's a random variable that we interpret as a waiting time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're waiting for something to happen, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, just have a concrete example in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose you're just waiting for a phone call, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now is time <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you're waiting to get a call, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which could come at any time in continuous time, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The geometric is discrete like flipping coins waiting for success, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Bernoulli trials wait for success in discrete times cuz they have discrete trials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is in continuous time, you're waiting for the phone call.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And suppose that this waiting time has the property that no matter how long you waited, just like that time is gone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not giving you progress towards getting your phone call.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's like starting from fresh every time, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the memoryless property means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as an equation, what it says is the probability that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION> given that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Imagine that <EXPRESSION> is measured in minutes or whatever unit you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This says you've already waited at least <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've already waited <EXPRESSION> minutes, and you haven't gotten your phone call.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you know <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what's the probability you would have to wait at least an additional <EXPRESSION> minutes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is just the same as the probability X is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you've started over with the fresh exponential distribution with the same parameter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the definition of the memoryless property, but I hope that this equation kind of intuitively make sense to capture that intuition of memorylessness.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now let's prove that in fact that this equation is satisfied by the exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for the exponential lambda, this is the general definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we're assuming <EXPRESSION> is exponential lambda and let's check that the equation holds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's find the probability that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't have to worry about whether it's strict inequality here, cuz it's a continuous random variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>, and this is the <EXPRESSION>, this is called the survival survival function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because what'ss the probability that, if you think of <EXPRESSION> rather than thinking of a waiting time thinking of it as like how long someone is gonna live?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that's the probability that they will live more than at least s seconds, so that's a survival thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is actually extremely important in what's called survival analysis in bio statistics, as well as in engineering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You wanna figure out how long is a certain piece of electronic's gonna last, things like that, then you need to look at survival functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well anyway that's just <EXPRESSION>, But the CDF was <EXPRESSION>, so that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've already seen scenarios where we start with a differential equation and then we generate a slope field that describes the solutions to the differential equation and then we use that to visualize those solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I want to do in this video is do an exercise that takes us the other way, start with a slope field and figure out which differential equation is the slope field describing the solutions for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I encourage you to look at each of these options and think about which of these differential equations is being described by this slope field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I encourage you to pause the video right now and try it on your own.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm assuming you have had a go at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's work through each of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way I'm going to do it is I'm just going to find some points that seem to be easy to do arithmetic with, and we'll see if the slope described by the differential equation at that point is consistent with the slope depicted in the slope field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I don't know, just for simplicity, le's define <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> for all of these.", "entities": [{"id": 4914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "So, when <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this <EXPRESSION> differential equation right over here, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> would be negative <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> or negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> would be negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, is that depicted here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, our slope isn't negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our slope here looks positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can rule this <EXPRESSION> out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's try the next <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, well then <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, once again, I just picked <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION> for convenience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could have picked any other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could have picked negative <EXPRESSION> and negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This just makes the arithmetic a little easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, when you look at that point that we've already looked at, our slope is clearly not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a positive slope here, so we can rule that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, for this magenta differential equation, if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are both = <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> is once again going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 4950, "label": "command", "start_offset": 128, "end_offset": 133}]}
{"text": "And we've already seen this slope is not <EXPRESSION> here, so rule that <EXPRESSION> out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now here we have <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>, so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, our derivate of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this looks interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like this slope right over here could be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This looks like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This looks like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would want to validate some other points, but this looks like a really, really good candidate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can also see what is happening here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were to just hold <EXPRESSION> constant at <EXPRESSION> but increase <EXPRESSION> along this line, we see that the slope is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is getting steeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we were to keep <EXPRESSION> constant and increase <EXPRESSION> across this line, we see that the slope increases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in general, we see that the slope increases as we go to the top right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we see that it decreases as we go to the bottom left and both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> become much, much more negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm feeling pretty good about this, especially if we can knock this <EXPRESSION> out here, if we can knock that <EXPRESSION> out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, then when <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION>, and this slope looks larger than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like <EXPRESSION>, but since we are really just eyeballing it, let's see if we can find something where this more clearly falls apart.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's look at the situation when they both = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in that case, <EXPRESSION> should still be = <EXPRESSION> because you have negative <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do we see that over here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our derivative here looks negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like negative <EXPRESSION>, which is consistent with this yellow differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope here is definitely not a positive <EXPRESSION>, so we could rule this <EXPRESSION> out as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we should feel pretty confident that this is the differential equation being described.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now that we've done it, we can actually think about well, okay, what are the solutions for this differential equation going to look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it depends where they start or what points they contain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a solution that contains that point, it looks like it might do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you had a solution that contained this point, it might do something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, it keeps going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like it would asymptote towards <EQUATION>, this downward sloping.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This essentially is the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, no that is not the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the line <EQUATION>, so that's this line right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it looks like if the solution contained, say, this point right over here, that would actually be a solution to the differential equation <EQUATION> and you can verify that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right now, we're finishing up with the <EXPRESSION> unit, and I'd like to continue in this lecture, lecture <EXPRESSION>, with some final remarks about exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'd like to do is just review something that I did quickly last time, and make a few philosophical remarks about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that the steps involved were maybe a little tricky, and so I'd like to go through it <EXPRESSION> more time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we showed was that the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> thing that I'd like to do is just explain the proof a little bit more clearly than I did last time with fewer symbols, or at least with this abbreviation of the symbol here, to show you what we actually did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll just remind you of what we did last time, and the <EXPRESSION> observation was to check, rather than the limit of this function, but to take the log <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is typically what's done when you have an exponential, when you have an exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we found was that the limit here was <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So last time, this is what we did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just wanted to be careful and show you exactly what the next step is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you exponentiate this fact; you take <EXPRESSION> to this power, that's going to tend to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we just observe that this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the basic ingredient here is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because the log function is the inverse of the exponential function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Who said it was?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't really know yet from this expression, in fact we did some cleverness with limits and derivatives, to figure out this limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was a very subtle thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the thing that I'd like to say - I'm sorry I'm going to erase this aside here - but you need to go back to your notes and remember that this is what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I want to have room for the next comment that I want to make on this little blackboard here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we just derived was this property here, but I made a claim yesterday, and I just want to emphasize it again so that we realized what it is that we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I looked at this backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> way you can think of this is we're evaluating this limit and getting an answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But all equalities can be read both directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can write it the other way: <EQUATION>, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of this expression here.", "entities": [{"id": 5028, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So that's just the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we read it backwards, what we're saying is that this limit is a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is very typical of mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You want to always reverse your perspective all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Equations work both ways, and in this case, we have <EXPRESSION> different things here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> was what we defined as the base, which when you graph <EXPRESSION>, you get slope <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it turns out to be = this limit, which we can calculate numerically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you do this on your calculators, you, of course, will have a way of programming in this number and evaluating it for each <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll have another button available to evaluate this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So another way of saying it is it that there's a relationship between these <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all of calculus is a matter of getting these relationships.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can look at these things in several different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, that's what we're going to be doing at least at the end of today in talking about derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A lot of times when we talk about derivatives, we're trying to look at them from several perspectives at once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I have to keep on going with exponents, because I have <EXPRESSION> loose end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> loose end that I did not cover yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's <EXPRESSION> very important formula that's left, and it's the derivative of the powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We actually didn't do this - well we did it for rational numbers <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we're going to check this for all real numbers, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So including all the irrational ones as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is also good practice for using base <EXPRESSION> and using logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me do this by our <EXPRESSION> methods that we can use to handle exponential type problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I just rewrite this base <EXPRESSION> again, that's just this formula over here.", "entities": [{"id": 5048, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now I can differentiate this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get that <EXPRESSION>, now I'm going to use prime notation, because I don't want to keep on writing that <EXPRESSION> here; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what I can do is I can use the chain rule.", "entities": [{"id": 5054, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 5055, "label": "method", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "The chain rule says that it's the derivative of this times the derivative of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of the exponential is just itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the derivative of this guy here, well I'll write it out once, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5057, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "So what's that =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this derivative here is Well the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just factors out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> now has derivative What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, so this is going to be times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, we rewrite it in the customary form, which is <EXPRESSION>, we put the <EXPRESSION> in front, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5069, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just derived the formula for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it didn't matter whether <EXPRESSION> was rational or irrational, it's the same proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay so now I have to show you how method <EXPRESSION> works as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do method <EXPRESSION>, which we call logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll leave that in the middle, because I want to remember the key property of logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> I'll differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Later on, what I'm going to use is that this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> way of evaluating a logarithmic derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other is to differentiate the explicit function that we have over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is just, as we said, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, you can now see by comparing these <EXPRESSION> pieces of arithmetic that they're basically the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Pretty much every time you convert to base <EXPRESSION> or you do logarithmic differentiation, it'll amount to the same thing, provided you don't get mixed up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You generally have to introduce a new symbol here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, you're dealing with exponents there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's worth it to know both points of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so now I want to make <EXPRESSION> last remark before we finish with exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I'll try to sell this to you in a lot of ways as the course goes on, but <EXPRESSION> thing that I want to try to emphasize is that the natural logarithm really is natural.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I claim that the natural log is natural.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the example that we're going to use for this illustration is economics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you are imagining the price of a stock that you own goes down by a dollar, that's a totally meaningless statement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It depends on a lot of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, it depends on whether the original price was a dollar or <EXPRESSION> dollars.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's not much meaning to these absolute numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always the ratios that matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, I just looked up an hour ago, the London Exchange closed, and it was down <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which as I said, is pretty meaningless unless you know what the actual total of this index is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out it was <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the change in the price, divided by the price, which in this case is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, is what matters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in this case, it happens to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what happened today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5099, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "That's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the - let me put a little box around it - the formula of logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let me just emphasize that it has an actual significance, and it's the <EXPRESSION> that's used by economists and people who are modeling prices of things all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They never use absolute prices when there are large swings.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They always use the log of the price.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's no point in using <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those give you junk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They give you an extra factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the natural log that's the obvious <EXPRESSION> to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's completely straightforward that this is a simpler expression than using <EXPRESSION> and having a factor of <EXPRESSION> there, which would just mess everything up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so this is just <EXPRESSION> illustration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anything that has to do with ratios is going to encounter logarithms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's pretty much it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all I want to say for now anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's lots more to say, but we'll be saying it when we do applications of derivatives in the <EXPRESSION> unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, what I'd like to do is to start a review.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to run through what we did in this unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you approximately what I expect from you on the test that's coming up tomorrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, so let's get started with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a review of Unit <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm just going to put on the board all of the things that you need to think about, anyway, keep in your head.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are what are called general formulas for derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there are the specific ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me just remind you what the general formulas are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's what you do to differentiate a sum, a multiple of a function, the product rule, the quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are several general formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's <EXPRESSION> more, which is the chain rule, which I'm going to say just a little bit more about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of a function of a function is the derivative of the function times the derivative of the other function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, I've abbreviated <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, so this is <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> ways of writing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other way is also <EXPRESSION> that you can keep in mind and you might find easier to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's probably a good idea to remember both formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the last type of general formula that we did was implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you do implicit differentiation, you have an equation and you don't try to solve for the unknown function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just put it in its simplest form and you differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we actually did this, in particular, for inverses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was a very, very key method for calculating the inverses of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's also true that logarithmic differentiation is of this type.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a transformation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're differentiating something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're transforming the equation by taking its logarithm and then differentiating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so there are a number of different ways this is applied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It can also be applied, anyway, these are <EXPRESSION> of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe in parenthesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are just examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll try to give examples of at least a few of these rules later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the specific functions that you know how to differentiate: well you know how to differentiate now <EXPRESSION> thanks to what I just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what you'll find is that it's much more convenient to remember the derivatives of these as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So memorize all of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, and then we had <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we had the inverses of the trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those are the ones you're responsible for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You should have enough time, anyway, to work out anything else, if you know these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so basically the idea is you have a bunch of special formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have a bunch of general formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put them together, and you can generate pretty much anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so let's do a few examples before going on with the review.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I do want to do a few examples in sort of increasing level of difficulty in how you would combine these things together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of all, you should remember that if you differentiate the <EXPRESSION> function, that's just - oh I just realized that I wanted to say something else before - so forget that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll do that in a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted to make some general remarks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's <EXPRESSION> rule that you discussed in my absence, which is the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I do want to make just a couple of remarks about the chain rule now to remind you of what it is, and also to present some consequences.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a little bit of extra on the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing that I want say is that we didn't really fully explain why it's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I do want to just explain it by example, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So imagine that you have a function which is, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5130, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then obviously, <EXPRESSION> is changing <EXPRESSION> times as fast as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The issue is this number here, <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now if <EXPRESSION> is a function of something, say <EXPRESSION>, shifted by some other constant here, then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now these terms don't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The constant terms don't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the consequence, if we put them together, is that <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so this is in a nutshell why the chain rule works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why these rates multiply.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing that I wanted to say about the chain rule is that it has a few consequences that make some of the other rules a little easier to remember or possibly to avoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The messiest rule in my humble opinion is the quotient rule, which is kind of a nuisance to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just remind you, if you take just the reciprocal of a function, and you differentiate it, there's another way of looking at this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's actually the way that I use, so I want to encourage you to think about it this way too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now instead of using the quotient rule, which we could've used, we can use the chain rule here with the power <EXPRESSION>, which works by the power law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is this =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, I've applied the chain rule rather than the quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, suppose I wanted to derive the full quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, now this may or may not be easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is <EXPRESSION> way of remembering what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you convert it to <EXPRESSION> and you differentiate that, now I can use the product rule on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, I have to use the chain rule and this rule as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>, the inverse, plus <EXPRESSION>, and then I have to differentiate the <EXPRESSION> inverse.", "entities": [{"id": 5163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "That's the formula right up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This actually explains the funny minus sign when you differentiate <EXPRESSION> in the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other formula, the other way that we did it, was by putting this over a common denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The common denominator was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This comes from this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> term, we have to multiply by an extra factor of <EXPRESSION>, because we have a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"id": 5174, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so this is the quotient rule as we wrote it down in lecture, and this is just another way of remembering it or deriving it without remembering it, if you just remember the chain rule and the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so you'll find that in many contexts, it's easier to do <EXPRESSION> or the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now I'm ready to differentiate the secant and a few such functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll do some examples here here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the way I think of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, the formula here is just what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now this is usually written in a different fashion, so that's why I'm doing this for a reason actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is although there are several formulas for things, with trig functions, there are usually <EXPRESSION> ways of writing something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm writing this <EXPRESSION> down so that you know what the standard way of presenting it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens here is that we have <EXPRESSION> minus signs cancelling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a perfectly acceptable answer, but there's a customary way in which is written.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's written <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the form that's generally used when you see these formulas written in textbooks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you know, you need to watch out, because if you ever want to use this kind of calculus, you'll have not be put off by all the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so getting slightly more complicated, how about if we differentiate <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And plugging in the formula that we had before, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> also has a very nice form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might say that this is kind of an ugly function, but the strange thing is that the natural log was invented before the exponential by a guy named Napier, exactly in order to evaluate functions like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the functions that people cared about a lot, because they were used in navigation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the multiplication he encoded using a logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these were invented long before people even knew about exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it was a surprise, actually, that it was connected to exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the natural log was invented before the <EXPRESSION> and everything else, exactly for this kind of purpose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, so this is a nice function, which was very important, so that your ships wouldn't crash into the reef.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's continue here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's another kind of function that I want to discuss with you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are the kinds in which there's a choice as to which of these rules to apply.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll just give a couple of examples of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There usually is a better and a worse way, so let me illustrate that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, yet another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope you've seen some of these before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "So it's a little bit more complicated than what we had before, because there were several more symbols here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what should we do at this point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's <EXPRESSION> choice which I claim is a bad idea, and that is to expand this out to the <EXPRESSION> power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a bad idea, because it's very long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then your answer will also be very long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It will fill the entire exam paper, for instance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We use the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So fortunately, this is relatively easy using the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just think of this box as being the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we take <EXPRESSION> times this guy to the <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of this guy, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5206, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 5207, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}, {"id": 5208, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "And this is, filling this in, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all you need to do differentiate things like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The chain rule is very effective.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm not really willing to answer too many questions about what's going to be on the exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the question that was just asked is exactly the kind of question I'm very happy to answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, the question was, in what form is what form is an acceptable answer?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now in real life, that is a really serious question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you ask a computer a question and it gives you <EXPRESSION> sheets of printout, it's useless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you really care what form answers are in, and indeed, somebody might really care what this thing to the <EXPRESSION> power is, and then you would be forced to discuss things in terms of that other functional form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the purposes of this exam, this is okay form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, any correct form is an okay form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I recommend strongly that you not try to simplify things unless we tell you to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes it will be to your advantage to simplify things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes we'll say simplify.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It takes a good deal of experience to know when it's really worth it to simplify expressions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is what is this derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's an answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the end of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a more customary form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is answer is okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same issue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do you have to show the work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well if I ask you what is <EXPRESSION>, then if you wrote down this answer or you wrote down this answer showing no work, that would be acceptable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the question was derive the formula for this from the formula for the derivative of the cosine or something like that, then it would not be acceptable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd have to carry out this arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in other words, typically this will come up, for instance, in various contexts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just basically have to follow directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The short answer to that is yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I will be getting to that when I discuss the rest of the material here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so let me just finish these examples with <EXPRESSION> last <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the last example that I'd like to write down is the <EXPRESSION> that I promised you in the <EXPRESSION> lecture, namely to differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Basically you're supposed to be able to differentiate any function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> that we mentioned at the beginning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's just = - I have to differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to use the chain rule - it's = the exponential times the derivative of this expression here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the <EXPRESSION> step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have to apply the product rule here.", "entities": [{"id": 5222, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 5223, "label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> factor, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Add to it what happens when I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> factor, leaving alone the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the end of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It wasn't that hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, it requires you to remember all of the rules, and a lot of formulas underlying them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's consistent with what I just told you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I told you that you wanted to know this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I told you that you needed to know this product rule, and that you needed to know the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I guess there was <EXPRESSION> more thing, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> came into play there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So of these formulas, we used <EXPRESSION> of them in this <EXPRESSION> calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now what other things did we talk about in Unit <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the main other thing that we talked about was the definition of a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also there was sort of a goal which was to get to the meaning of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are things - so we had a couple of ways of looking at it, or at least a couple that I'm going to emphasize right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION>, let me remind you what the formula is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative is the limit as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's it, and this is certainly going to be a central focus here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you want to be able to recognize this formula in a number of ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we use this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well <EXPRESSION> thing we did was we calculated a bunch of these rates of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, more or less, they're the ones which are written right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This list of functions here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, which ones did we start out with just straight from the definition here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which of these things?", "entities": []}
{"text": "There were a whole bunch of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we started out with a function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now there was a little bit of subtlety with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got them using something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't quite get them all the way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got them using the case <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got them from the derivative at <EXPRESSION>, we got the formulas for the derivatives of sine and cosine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that was an argument which involved plugging in <EXPRESSION>, and running through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We also did <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that may be it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh yeah, I think that's about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That may be about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It isn't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so let me make a connection here which you probably haven't yet made, which is that we did it for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we also did it for <EXPRESSION>'.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So sorry, I shouldn't write primes, because that's not consistent with the claim there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I differentiated the product; I differentiated the quotient using the same <EXPRESSION> notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I forgot that because I wasn't there when it happened.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So look, these are the ones that you do by this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, you might have to reduce them to other things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These involve using something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> involves using the slope of this function at <EXPRESSION>, just the way the sine and the cosine did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> involves the slopes of the individual functions, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> also involves the individual So, in other words, it doesn't get you all the way through to the end, but it's expressed in terms of something simpler in each of these cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I could go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't do these in class, but you're certainly <EXPRESSION> is a perfectly okay <EXPRESSION> on <EXPRESSION> of the exams.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We ask you for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, I'm not claiming that it's going to be <EXPRESSION> on this list, but it certainly can be any <EXPRESSION> of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're not going to ask you to go all the way through to the beginning in these formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are also some fundamental limits that I certainly want you to know about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these you can derive in reverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will describe that now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me also emphasize the following thing: I want to read this backwards now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the theme from the very beginning of this lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if you're given the function <EXPRESSION>, you can figure out its derivative by this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the formula for this in terms of what's on the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, you can also use the formula in that direction, and if you know the slope of something, you can figure out what the limit is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION> so it's clearer to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose you look at this limit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I claim that you should recognize that is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the function <EQUATION>, which of course we know to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is reading this formula in reverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's recognizing that <EXPRESSION> of these limits - let me rewrite this again here - <EXPRESSION> of these so-called difference quotient limits is a derivative.", "entities": [{"id": 5276, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "And since we know a formula for that derivative, we can evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And lastly, there's <EXPRESSION> other type of thing which I think you should know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the ones you do with difference quotients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are also other formulas that you want to be able to derive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You want to be able to derive formulas by implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, the basic idea is to take whatever equation you've got and simplify it as much as possible, without insisting that you solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not necessarily the most appropriate way to get the rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The much simpler formula is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that <EXPRESSION> is easier to differentiate implicitly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I should say, do this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's, if you like, a typical derivation that you might see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's <EXPRESSION> last type of problem that you'll face, and it's the other thing that I claim we discussed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it goes all the way back to the <EXPRESSION> lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the last thing that we'll be talking about is tangent lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The geometric point of view of a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll be doing more of this in next the unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of all, you'll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's often fairly straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing is to graph <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of a function.", "entities": [{"id": 5286, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing, which I'm going to throw in here, because I regard it in a sort of geometric vein, although it's got an analytical aspect to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you combine the <EXPRESSION> together, you get something else.", "entities": [{"id": 5289, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And so this is to recognize differentiable functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so how do you do this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we really only have <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to check the left and right tangents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They must be =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, this is a property that you should be familiar with from some of your exercises.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the idea is simply, that if the tangent line exists, it's the same from the right and from the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, now I'm going to just do <EXPRESSION> example here from this sort of qualitative sketching skill to give you an example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a graph of a function like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I want to do underneath is draw the graph of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the function <EQUATION>, and here I'm going to draw the graph of the function <EQUATION> right underneath it.", "entities": [{"id": 5294, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "So now, let's think about what it's supposed to look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> step that you need to make in order to do this, is to draw a few tangent lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to draw <EXPRESSION> down here.", "entities": [{"id": 5297, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And I'm going to draw <EXPRESSION> up here.", "entities": [{"id": 5299, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Now, the tangent lines here - notice that the slope of these tangent lines are all positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So everything I draw down here is going to be above the <EXPRESSION>-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Furthermore, as I go further to the left, they get steeper and steeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they're getting higher and higher.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the function is coming down like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It starts up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll draw it in green to illustrate the graph here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this function here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As we get farther out, it's getting flatter and flatter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's leveling off, but above the axis like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of the things to emphasize is, you should not expect the derivative to look like the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's totally different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's keeping track at each point of its tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, you should get some kind of physical feel for it, and we'll be practicing this more in the next unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me give you an example of a function which does exactly this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate it, you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this plot above is, roughly speaking, the logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this plot underneath is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We still have time for <EXPRESSION> question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, fire away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's in a lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm happy to do it right now, but it's going to take me a whole <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's how you do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this is hopeless to differentiate, so I rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5309, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "And now I have to differentiate that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I differentiate it, I get the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a hard step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the left side I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5315, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So I'm doing this super fast because we have <EXPRESSION> seconds left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is the hard step right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it needs for you to know that <EQUATION> over Oh, bad bad bad, secant squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was ahead of myself so fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need have known this in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the input into this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, what we have is that <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last bit of the problem is to rewrite this in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5321, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "And that you have to do with a right triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>, then the angle is <EXPRESSION>, because the tangent of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this expresses the fact that the tangent of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the hypotenuse is the square root of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> divided by that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing is <EXPRESSION> divided by the <EXPRESSION>, the quantity squared.", "entities": [{"id": 5333, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "So, and then the last little bit here, since I'm racing along, is that it's <EXPRESSION>, which I incorrectly wrote over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so good luck on the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you tomorrow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far, we've seen things about vectors, equation of planes, motions in space, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Basically we've done geometry in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, calculus, really, is about studying functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we're going to actually move on to studying functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this new unit, what we'll do over the next <EXPRESSION> weeks or so will be about functions of several variables and their derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so <EXPRESSION> of all, we should try to figure out how we are going to think about functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, remember, if you have a function of <EXPRESSION> variable, that means you have a quantity that depends on <EXPRESSION> parameter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe <EXPRESSION> depends on the variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, for example, a function that you all know is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the way we would represent that is maybe just by plotting the graph of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the graph of a function, we plot <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "And, the graph of a <EXPRESSION> function that looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now, let's say that we had, actually, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that the value of <EXPRESSION> depends actually on <EXPRESSION> different parameters, say, if the variables are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, or they can have any names you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, given values of the <EXPRESSION> parameters, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the function will give us a number that we'll call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> according to some formula, OK, not very surprising so far.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, I can give you the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, as with functions of <EXPRESSION> variable, we don't need things to be defined everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes there is the domain of definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this <EXPRESSION> is defined all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if I tell you, say, <EQUATION>, well, this is only defined if <EXPRESSION> is nonnegative.", "entities": [{"id": 5361, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "If I tell you <EQUATION>, that's only defined if <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so these are mathematical examples given by explicit formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, there's physical examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, so examples coming from real life, so for example, you can look at the temperature at the certain point on the surface of the earth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you use maybe longitude and latitude; that's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have <EXPRESSION> = the temperature at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, because temperature depends also may be on how high up you are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It depends on elevation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's actually a function of maybe <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it also depends on time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, maybe it's a function of <EXPRESSION> in <EXPRESSION> coordinates in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you see that real-world functions can depends on a lot of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, our goal will be to understand how to deal with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now you will see very soon, but actually it's already tricky enough to picture a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we are going to focus on the case of functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we'll see that if we have more than <EXPRESSION> variables, then it's harder to plot the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We cannot draw with the graph looks like anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the tools are the same, the notion of partial derivatives, grade and vector, and so on, all the tools that we will develop work exactly the same way no matter how many variables you have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'll say, for simplicity we'll focus mostly on <EXPRESSION> or sometimes <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it works the same in any number of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the <EXPRESSION> question is how to visualize a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> thing we can do is try to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5382, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "So, maybe I should say <EXPRESSION> which is a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> answer will be, we can try to look at it's graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the idea is the same as with <EXPRESSION> variable, namely, we look at all the possible values of the parameters, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and for each of them, we plot a point whose height is the value of a function at these parameters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll plot, let's say, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And, now that will become, actually, a surface in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and if we take all of these points together, they will give us some surface that sits in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, shorthand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's say how to visualize a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, how do we do that concretely?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say that I give you a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we try to represent it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do our <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I give you a function <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5406, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "OK, so it looks a little bit silly because it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, that's not the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's still a valid function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just happens to be constant with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to draw the graph we look at the surface in space defined by <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "What kind of surface is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a plane, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if we want to draw it, <EQUATION> will look, well, let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": [{"id": 5415, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I look at what happens in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane in the plane of a blackboard, it will just look like a line that goes downward with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it will be this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what happens if I change <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I change <EXPRESSION>, nothing happens because <EXPRESSION> doesn't appear in this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, if instead of setting <EQUATION> I set <EQUATION>, I'm in front of the blackboard, or <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> at the back.", "entities": [{"id": 5428, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "Well, it still looks exactly the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I have this plane that actually contains the <EXPRESSION> axis and slopes downwards with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of hard to draw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you see immediately what the big problem with graphs will be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, these pictures are hard to read.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's our <EXPRESSION> graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, a question so far?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's say that we have a slightly more complicated function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we see it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's draw another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I give you <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5433, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So, we should try to picture what the surface <EQUATION> looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, maybe you are very fast and figured out what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if not, then we need to work piece by piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe it will help if we understand <EXPRESSION> what it does in the plane of the blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if we look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, that means we set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5440, "label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "And then, <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "What is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a parabola pointing downwards, and starting at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we should draw maybe this downward parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It starts at <EXPRESSION> and it cuts the <EXPRESSION> axis at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, that gives us <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we might have an idea of what it might look like, or maybe not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's get more slices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what it does in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, this other vertical plane that's coming towards us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, if we set <EQUATION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5458, "label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "It's, again, a parabola going downwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I'm going to try to draw a parabola that goes downward, but now to the front and to the back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we are starting to have a slightly better idea but we still don't know whether the cross section of this thing might be round, square, something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it wants more confirmation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We might want to also figure out where the surface intersects the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we hit the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>, that becomes <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is a circle of radius <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the unit size.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that here, we actually have the unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, you should imagine that you have this thing that when you slice it by a vertical plane, looks like a downwards parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's actually a surface of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can rotate it around the <EXPRESSION> axis, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you stare long enough at that equation, you'll actually see that, yes, we know that it had to be like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, see, so these are useful ways of trying to guess what the graph looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, the other way is to just ask your computer to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you know, you will get that kind of formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, well, I can leave it on if you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, because I plotted a different function that I will show you later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it goes this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, if you want, it's really going downward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, I agree that the sheet is upside down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because I plotted something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, in fact, so I plotted in my computer was actually <EXPRESSION> that looks like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, it's the same with a parabola going upwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want to see more examples, I have various examples to show, well, here's the graph, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, so that <EXPRESSION> is kind of interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like a saddle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then it's a parabola going up, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's what we see to the left and to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if you put it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then that's a parabola going downwards, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have a parabola going downwards in <EXPRESSION> direction, upwards in the other <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And together, they form this surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, you can plot much more complicated functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this <EXPRESSION>, well, if you can read very small things, you can see the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't matter, just to show you that you can put a formula into a computer: it will show you a picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's pretty good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, you can see that it can get a bit cluttered because maybe those features that are hidden behind, or maybe we have trouble seeing if we don't have a computer, that looks very readable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, this is kind of hard to visualize sometimes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there is another way to plot the functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, let's call it the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the contour plot is a very elegant solution to the problem that it's difficult to draw to space pictures on a sheet of paper or on a blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, instead, let's try to represent the function of <EXPRESSION> variables by just the map, you know, the same way that when you walk around, you have actually geographical maps that fit on a piece of paper that tell you about what the real world looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what contour plot looks something like this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's an <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that, you have a bunch of curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what the curves represent are the elevations on the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, this curve might correspond to all the points where <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that curve might be all the points where <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> and so on, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when you see you this kind of plot, you're supposed to think that the graph of the function sits somewhere in space above that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's like a map telling you how high things are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what you would want to do with the function, really, is be able to tell quickly what's the value at a given point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's say I want to look at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know that <EXPRESSION>  is somewhere between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, it's much faster to read than the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the graph I might have to look carefully, and then measure things, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, I can just raise the value of <EXPRESSION> by comparing with the nearby lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let me try to make that more precise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it shows all the points where <EXPRESSION> = some fixed values, some fixed constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, these constants typically are chosen at regular intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, here I chose <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and they could continue with <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": [{"id": 5498, "label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> way to think about it, how does this relate to the graph?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's the same thing as cutting, I mean, we slice the graph by horizontal planes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, horizontal planes have equations of a form <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION> <EQUATION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe the graph of my function will be some sort of plot out there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if I slice it by the plane <EQUATION>, then I will get the level curve, which is the point where <EQUATION>, and so, that's called a level curve of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and so we repeat the process with maybe <EQUATION>, and we get another level curve, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, then we squish all of them up, and that's how we get the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so each of these lines, imagine that this is like some mountain or something that you are hiking on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Each of these lines tells you how you could move to stay at a constant height if you want to get to the other side of the mountain but without ever going up or down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would just walk along that path, and it will get you there without effort.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, if you have been talking about hiking on mountains, well, that's exactly what a topographical map is about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I need to zoom a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a topographic map, this <EXPRESSION> from the US geological survey shows you, basically, all the level curves of an altitude function on a piece of land.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you know that if you walk right along these curves, you will stay along the same height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know that if you walk towards, these don't have numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me find a place with numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, there is a <EXPRESSION> in the middle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, we don't have a formula for that function, but we have a contour plot, and that's what we need actually to understand what's going on there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so another example of contour plots, well, you've probably seen various versions of these temperature maps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's supposed to be how warm it is right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of having curves, it has all these colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the effect is the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look at the separations between consecutive colors, these are the level curves of a function that tells you the temperature at a given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so these are examples of contour plots in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, no questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's do a couple of examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's start with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's try to plot it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's the <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's the level, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where's the level <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when negative <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you go to minus <EXPRESSION>, and that will be where my level <EXPRESSION> is, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is negative <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do you see how we got that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let me do it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't see anybody nodding, so that's kind of bad news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I want to know, where is the level curve, say, <EXPRESSION>, I try to set <EQUATION>", "entities": [{"id": 5546, "label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION> means that negative <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> means that <EQUATION>, and <EXPRESSION> = minus <EXPRESSION> is this horizontal line on this chart.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and same with the others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can see on the map that the value of a function doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you move parallel to the <EXPRESSION> axis, nothing happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you move in the <EXPRESSION> direction, it decreases at a constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why the contours are evenly spaced.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How spaced out they are tells you, actually, how steep things are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that corresponds exactly to that picture, except that here we draw <EXPRESSION> coming to the front, and <EXPRESSION> to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an unfortunate consequence of the usual way of plotting things in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so these horizontal lines here correspond actually to horizontal lines here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, or maybe I will write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5561, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "It's really the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, let's see, where is this function = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we said <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> in the unit circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, the <EXPRESSION> level, well, let's say that this is my unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's where it's at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's only going to be here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's just a single point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a circle of radius square root of <EXPRESSION>, which is about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's somewhere here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, minus <EXPRESSION>, similarly, will be <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5579, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Square root of <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, minus <EXPRESSION> will be of radius <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": [{"id": 5586, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So, what I want to show here is that they are getting closer and closer apart, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Things don't change if I rotate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, this top here is kind of flat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it gets steeper and steeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's what we observe on that picture there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe actually I'll make it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it looks exactly the same as this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the difference is if you can see the numbers which are not there, so you can see them, then you would know that instead of decreasing as we move out, this <EXPRESSION> is increasing as we go out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's where we use, actually, the labels on the level curves that tell us whether things are going up or down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the contour plots look exactly the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the contour plot, well, let me actually zoom out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the contour plot looks like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if you look on the plot, say that you started at the saddle point in the middle and you try to stay at the same level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it looks like a mountain pass, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, on the map, they look exactly like this, too, these crossing lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, these are things that go on the side of the <EXPRESSION> mountains that are to the left and right, and stay at the same height as the mountain pass.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, if you go along the <EXPRESSION> direction, to the left or to the right, then you go towards positive values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the equation for, the function was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can try to plot them by hand and confirmed that it does look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I trust my computer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, finally, this <EXPRESSION>, well, so the contour plot looks a bit complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you can see <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, at some point in the middle, we have a mountain pass.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there, we see the <EXPRESSION> crossing lines again, like, on the plot of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, at this saddle point here, if we go north or south, then we go down on either side to the Valley.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if we go east or west, then we go towards the mountains.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll go up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, does that make sense a little bit?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, reading plots is not easy, but hopefully we'll get used to it very soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so actually let's say, well, OK, so, I want to point out <EXPRESSION> thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I can ask myself, is the value of the function increase or decrease in each of these situations?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's the kind of thing that the contour plot can tell me very quickly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So OK, so say, for example, that I have a piece of contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That looks, you know, like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe this is <EQUATION>, and this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, let's say that I start at the point, say, at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, similarly, I can tell that if <EXPRESSION> increases, then <EXPRESSION>, well, it looks like if I increase <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> will also increase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if <EXPRESSION> decreases, then <EXPRESSION> decreases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's the kind of qualitative analysis that we can do easily from the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, maybe we'd like to actually be more precise in that, and tell how fast <EXPRESSION> changes if I change <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so to find the rate of change, that's exactly where we use derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So So, we are going to have to deal with partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I will explain to you soon why partial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's defined as a limit when delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the change in <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, it's not going to fit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to go to the next line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be the limit as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the change in <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes you write delta <EXPRESSION> for the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you take the limit of this rate of increase as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, of course, if you have a formula for <EXPRESSION>, then you know, at least you should know, I suspect most of you know how to actually take the derivative of a function from its formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So Now, how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, and I should also tell you what this means on the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I plot the graph of a function, and to have my point, <EXPRESSION>, and here I have <EXPRESSION>, how do I see the derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I look at the tangent line to the graph, and the slope of the tangent line is <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, not every function has a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have functions that are not regular enough to actually have a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this class, we are not going to actually worry too much about differentiability.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's good, at least, to be aware that you can't always take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, yes, and what else do I want to remind you of?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is this kind of familiar to you?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, I mean, maybe with different notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you called that delta <EXPRESSION> or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you called that <EXPRESSION> or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's the usual approximation formula using the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you put more terms, then you get the dreaded Taylor approximation that I know you guys don't like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the question is how do we do the same for a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the difficulty there is we can change <EXPRESSION>, or we can change <EXPRESSION>, or we can change both.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, presumably, the manner in which <EXPRESSION> changes will be different depending on whether we change <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's why we have several different notions of derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, OK, we have a notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this symbol is partial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's a special notation for partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, essentially what it means is we are going to do a derivative where we care about only <EXPRESSION> variable at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why it's partial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's missing the other variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a function of several variables doesn't have the usual derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has only partial derivatives for each variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here I'm actually not changing <EXPRESSION> at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just changing <EXPRESSION> and looking at the rate of change with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I have the same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this time I keep <EXPRESSION> the same, but I change <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's the definition of a partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we say that a function is differentiable if these things exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so most of the functions we'll see are differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we'll actually learn how to compute their partial derivatives without having to do this because we'll just have the usual methods for computing derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, I claim you already know how to take partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see what it means geometrically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, geometrically, my function can be represented by this graph, and I fix some point, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I'm going to ask myself what happens if I change the value of, well, <EXPRESSION>, keeping <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I keep <EXPRESSION> constant and change <EXPRESSION>, it means that I'm moving forwards or backwards parallel to the <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that determines for me the vertical plane parallel to the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane when I fix <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means it's the rate of change if I move along this curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, if I look at the slope of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I draw the tangent line to this slice, then the slope will be partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I have a better picture of that somewhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, here it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's the same picture, just with different colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I take the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I slice it by a vertical plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get the curve, and now I take the slope of that curve, and that gives me the partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I fix <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that I slice by a plane that's parallel to the blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get a curve, and I looked at the slope of that curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's just a matter of formatting <EXPRESSION> variable, setting it constant, and looking at the other <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how to compute these things, well, we actually, to find, well, there's a piece of notation I haven't told you yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, another notation you will see, I think this is what <EXPRESSION> uses a lot in physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this is what <EXPRESSION> uses a lot in applied math, which is the same thing as physics but with different notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it just too different notations: partial <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, they are the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we just treat <EXPRESSION> as a constant, and <EXPRESSION> as a variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, vice versa if we want to find partial with aspect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me just finish with <EXPRESSION> quick example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that they give you <EQUATION>, then partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5728, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "Well, let's take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here it's <EXPRESSION> times a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Derivative of <EQUATION> times the constant plus what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 5732, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, because it's a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you do, instead, <EXPRESSION>, then this is actually a constant times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's fairly easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to keep remembering which <EXPRESSION> is a variable, and which <EXPRESSION> isn't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so more about this next time, and we will also learn about maxima and minima in several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's now attempt to find a solution for the logistic differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we already found some constant solutions, we can think through that a little bit just as a little bit of review from the last few videos.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll just stay at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is nice because that's what would actually happen in a real population.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives us the constant solution that <EQUATION>, that's <EXPRESSION> solution of this differential equation, not that interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A <EXPRESSION> population will never grow or change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other constant solution is what if our population started at the maximum of what the environment could sustain, and in that situation this term is going to be <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and so in there, the population would also not change.", "entities": [{"id": 5761, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "It would just stay at <EXPRESSION>, and so the rate of change would just stay at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's another constant solution, that we start at the maximum population and then this differential equation tells us a scenario that never changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we said, hey look, there could be something interesting that happens if our initial condition, which we called <EXPRESSION> sub-not, that's our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can imagine a scenario where we asymptote towards <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can solve this to find this, this <EXPRESSION> to find the actual analytic expression for this <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is interesting, this is what could be used to model populations that would be more consistent with a Malthusian mindset.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if we can do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To do that we just have to realize this is a separable differential equation, and we're assuming is a function of <EXPRESSION>, we're going to solve for an <EXPRESSION> that satisfies this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we just have to separate it from the explicit ts, but there are no explicit ts here, so it's quite easy to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this part right over here, and I'm going to divide both sides by that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to leave the r on the right hand side, it'll make things, I think, a little bit easier as we try to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION> times <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5783, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 5784, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "Another way we could think about it, well actually, let me just continue to tackle it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get that, and now what I want to do is take the anti-derivative of both sides with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just going to be rt times some constant, but what's this going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is kind of this messy thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe if we could break this out, if we can expand this into <EXPRESSION> fractions, do a little bit of partial fraction expansion, maybe we can come up with an expression that's a little bit easier to find the anti-derivative of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm hoping that I can find an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION> where <EXPRESSION> = this business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "= <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can find an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just partial fraction expansion, if this looks unfamiliar to you I encourage you to review that part on Khan Academy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do a search for partial fraction expansion on Khan Academy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll just add these <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just adding fractions with unlike denominators.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be = this,<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we can try to think about what is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> going to be =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What can they be =?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I have a constant term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have any <EXPRESSION> term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's pretty nice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can say that <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and that if <EQUATION> we have negative <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5823, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 5826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "Well what's <EXPRESSION> going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can rewind the video and review that, if you find it necessary, so let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how does this help us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, hey, you probably might be recognizing the anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and you might even see this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just think through this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION> is a natural log, just did a new color, is a natural log of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could do the same thing over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice, I have an expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What would be the derivative of this expression right over here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be negative <EXPRESSION>, if I'm talking the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it would be negative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a positive <EXPRESSION> here, and I could even make it negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can turn this, I can clear this out of the way, instead of having a positive there I could have, I guess I could say a double negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write this in a new color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I were to take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, so the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is that, which is what we just found.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So copy and paste.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be that, it's going to be that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, just straight out of the chain rule, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5861, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "Actually, why not, let's just do that just to make it clear, cause this really isn't so much differential equations, but sometimes some of the calculus that we learned not too long ago, and even frankly some of the algebra, it's nice to not skip steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I distribute this, edit, paste.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Woops, I wanted to copy and paste.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, copy and paste, so I have that, and then I have, I can copy and paste, so that I'm just distributing this business right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get that, now let me clean it up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have that right over here, and of course we have this being = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take the anti-derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well I'm just going to get this minus this right over that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm going to assume that my <EXPRESSION> meets this assumption right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to assume, assume <EXPRESSION> is going to be less than <EXPRESSION> and greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that this thing, this <EXPRESSION> is always going to be positive, and if <EXPRESSION> is always between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, that means that this thing is always going to be positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that helps me clear things up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me do it in this color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That helps me get rid of that, helps me get rid of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can instead throw some parentheses here, and why don't I subtract the <EXPRESSION> from both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would get rid of it here, so edit, cut, and paste, so I have the <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know I'm overwriting my own work, which is not making it look as clean as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just trying to clean it up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have an arbitrary constant that I haven't really solved for yet minus another constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just call this some other constant, let me just call it a general <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just call this <EXPRESSION>, so clear, and I'm just going to call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am just going to call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I could even simplify this a little bit, but actually I just realized I'm <EXPRESSION> minutes into this video, which is longer than I like to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's continue this in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was getting excited because I'm so close.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm so close to solving for an <EXPRESSION> that satisfies our logistic differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very, very exciting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do some more examples with exact differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm getting these problems from page <EXPRESSION> of my old college differential equations books.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> edition of Elementary Differential Equations by William Boyce and Richard DiPrima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to make sure they get credit, that I'm not making up these problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm getting it from their book.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, so I'm just going to give a bunch of equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to figure out if they're exact, and if they are exact, we'll use what we know about exact differential equations to figure out their solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> they have is, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is our <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> although, this is only a function of <EXPRESSION> and then this is our <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could say that's <EXPRESSION>, or that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could also say that, if this is exact well, <EXPRESSION> let's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This exact, before we start talking about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there's no <EXPRESSION> here, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate of change that this changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the rate of change this changes, with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are just constants from an <EXPRESSION> point of view, so this is all going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we do see that they're both <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, we don't have to use exact equations here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll do it, just so that we get used to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you look here, you actually could have figured out that this is actually a separable equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, this is exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So knowing that it's exact, it tells us that there's some function <EXPRESSION>, where psi is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where <EXPRESSION> = this function, = <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> I shouldn't say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we can figure out <EXPRESSION>, then we can rewrite this equation as <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "Let me switch colors, or it's going to get monotonous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This right here, if we can find a <EXPRESSION>, where the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, then this can be rewritten as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how do we know that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, using the partial derivative chain rules, is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the whole point of exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, so let's figure out what our <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, before we figure out, if the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>, then if you integrate both sides, you just the solution of this equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5958, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 146}]}
{"text": "So using this information, if we can solve for PRESSION>, then we know that the solution of this differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if we have some initial conditions, we could solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's integrate both sides of this equation, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5964, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}, {"id": 5966, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And then we get <EQUATION>, plus some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 5969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "Let's call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, normally when you take an antiderivative, you have just <EXPRESSION> here, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you can kind of say we took an anti-partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you took a partial derivative, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, not only do you lose constants that's why we have a plus <EXPRESSION>, normally but you also lose anything that's a function of just <EXPRESSION>, and not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example, take the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, you're going to get this, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the partial derivative of a function, purely of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it will disappear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So anyway, we take the antiderivative of this, we get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we use this information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we use this information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We take the partial of this expression, and we say, well, the partial of this expression, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, has to = this, and then we can solve for <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, then we'll be done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This part is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>, because these are constants, from a <EXPRESSION> point of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION>, which is the partial of psi, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if we wanted to figure out what <EXPRESSION> is, we get <EXPRESSION> just integrate both sides, with respect to <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6000, "label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 92}, {"id": 6001, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "Now, you could have a plus <EXPRESSION> there, but if you watched the previous example, you'll see that that <EXPRESSION> kind of merges with the other <EXPRESSION>, so you don't have to worry about it right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is our <EXPRESSION> function, as we know it now, not worrying about the plus <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"id": 6007, "label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, plus <EXPRESSION> which we figured out is this plus <EXPRESSION>, minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6013, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 39}, {"id": 6014, "label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": 6015, "label": "command", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 106}]}
{"text": "And we know a solution of our original differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution of our differential equation is this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6021, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "If you had some additional conditions, you could test it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I encourage you to test this out on this original equation, or I encourage you to take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and prove to yourself that if you took the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, here, implicitly, that you would get this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, let's do another <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's clear image.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the more examples you see, the better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see, this <EXPRESSION> says <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "So what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, just this part right here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is different than the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can't solve this using our exact methodology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was a fairly straightforward problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm running out of time, so I want to do <EXPRESSION> that's not too complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, <EXPRESSION> actually, let me do this in the next problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to rush these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will continue this in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This time, we started solving differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> lecture of the term, and I have yet to solve a single differential equation in this class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that will be rectified from now until the end of the term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what does such an equation look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll find some function of <EXPRESSION> plus some other function of <EXPRESSION> = yet another function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Obviously, the <EXPRESSION> doesn't have the same status here that <EXPRESSION> does, so <EXPRESSION> is extremely limited in how it can appear in the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, <EXPRESSION> can be pretty much arbitrary in those places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's the equation we are talking about, and I'll put it up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> version of it, and we'll call them purple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, why is that called the linear equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The word linear is a very heavily used word in mathematics, science, and engineering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is not a variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you will learn, in a certain sense, it helps to think of it as <EXPRESSION>, not right now perhaps, but think of it as linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The most closely analogous thing would be a linear equation, a real linear equation, the kind you studied in high school, which would look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would have <EXPRESSION> variables, and, I guess, constant coefficients, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's a linear equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the sense in which this is linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's linear in <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which are the analogs of the variables <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A little bit of terminology, if <EQUATION>, it's called homogeneous, the same way this equation is called homogeneous, as you know from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, if the right hand side is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6081, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> I should write here, but I won't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's called homogeneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is a common form for the equation, but it's not what it's called standard form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The standard form for the equation, and since this is going to be a prime course of confusion, which is probably completely correct, but a prime source of confusion is what I meant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can always convert that to a standard form by simply dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6086, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "And if I do that, the equation will look like <EXPRESSION> plus, now, it's common to not call it <EXPRESSION> anymore, the coefficient, because it's really <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, therefore, it's common to adopt, yet, a new letter for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the standard <EXPRESSION> that many people use is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about the right hand side?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We needed a letter for that, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, but we'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when I talk about the standard linear form for a linear <EXPRESSION> order equation, it's absolutely that that I'm talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you immediately see that there is a potential for confusion here because what did I call the standard form for a <EXPRESSION> order equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to say, not this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The standard <EXPRESSION> order form, what would that be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it would be <EXPRESSION> =, and everything else on the left hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I turn this into the standard <EXPRESSION> order form, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, of course, nobody would write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, I explicitly want to say that this is a form which I will never use for this equation, although half the books of the world do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In short, this poor little <EXPRESSION> order equation belongs to <EXPRESSION> ethnic groups.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's both a <EXPRESSION> order equation, and therefore, its standard form should be written this way, but it's also a linear equation, and therefore its standard form should be used this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it has to decide, and I have decided for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is, above all, a linear equation, not just a <EXPRESSION> order equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in this course, this will always be the standard form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, well, what on earth is the difference?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't do it that way, the difference is entirely in the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if you get the sign of <EXPRESSION> wrong in the answers, it is just a disaster from that point on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A trivial little change of sign in the answer produces solutions and functions which have totally different behavior.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you are going to be really lost in this course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe I should draw a line through it to indicate, please don't pay any attention to this whatsoever, except that we are not going to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, well, what's so important about this equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, number <EXPRESSION>, it can always be solved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a very, very big thing in differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's also the equation which arises in a variety of models.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm just going to list a few of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the mixing model, which is hardly less important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it's almost as important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have that in your problem set.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, there are other, slightly less important models.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is the model of radioactive decay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A classic example is the motion of a rocket being fired off, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": ", etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, today I have to pick a model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is going to be today's model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's on the problem sets.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is not going to be the only lecture on the linear equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, we can't do everything today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's talk about the temperature concentration model, except I'm going to change its name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to change its name to the conduction diffusion model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll put conduction over there, and diffusion over here, let's say, since, as you will see, the similarities, they are practically the same model.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Apply the chain rule to <EQUATION>", "entities": [{"id": 6124, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"id": 6125, "label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So now let's plug in all of our numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, the other theme is, you don't plug in numbers, fixed numbers, until everything has stopped moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At this point, we've already calculated our rates of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I can put in the numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6127, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Cancel out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6129, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "So let's try to write this as a, so let's see, if I write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just rewrote it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I wrote this as <EXPRESSION>, that becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I add a <EXPRESSION>, I have to also subtract a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "I can't just add <EXPRESSION> arbitrarily to things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I add <EXPRESSION> I have to subtract a <EXPRESSION> to cancel out with that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6142, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 6143, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}, {"id": 6144, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "So I really haven't changed this at all, I just rewrote it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this now, I can rewrite this term right here as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this becomes plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6147, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "That's this term right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6149, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So I could rewrite my whole <EXPRESSION> is now = <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> over this thing, <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6156, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 6157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 68}, {"id": 6158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 127, "end_offset": 131}]}
{"text": "Now, I already said, I know what the inverse Laplace transform of this thing is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I just have to figure out what the inverse Laplace transform of this thing is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of this let me pick a nice color of this blue thing in the blue box, and then I can express it as a convolution integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how do I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could just do it right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write that down, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "And now the convolution theorem tells us that this is going to be = the inverse Laplace transform of this <EXPRESSION> term in the product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're not too different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I just said confused me a bit, so I don't want to confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think you get the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have these <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I recognize these independently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can independently take the inverse of each of these things, so the inverse Laplace transform of their products is going to be the convolution of each of their inverse transforms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what's this over here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I had this in the beginning of the problem?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The inverse Laplace transform of this, right here, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're going to convolute that with the inverse Laplace transform of this right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do a little bit of work on the side, just to make sure we get this right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the Laplace transform of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that will be = <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6173, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "We essentially shifted it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we have something that looks very similar to this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we just set our <EXPRESSION> to be = <EXPRESSION>, here our <EQUATION>, then it fits this pattern.", "entities": [{"id": 6178, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the solution to our differential equation, even though it's not in a pleasant form to look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can, if we want, express it as an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not going to actually solve the integral in this problem, because it gets hairy, and it's not even clear that well, I won't even attempt to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I just want to get into a form, and from there it's just integral calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "or maybe a computer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the convolution of these <EXPRESSION> things?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I could actually switch, and I haven't shown you this, but we can switch the order either way, but actually let me just do it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could write this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> way, that if I wanted to express the solution of this differential equation's integral, I could write it like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it actually should be kind of obvious to you that this could go either way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because when it was a product up here, obviously order does not matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could write this term <EXPRESSION>, or I could write that term <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So regardless of which term is written <EXPRESSION>, the same principle would apply.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll formally prove it in a future video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could have also done it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could have written this expression as <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, convoluted with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that would be = the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are equivalent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either of these would be an acceptable answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And normally on a test like this, the teacher won't expect you to actually evaluate these integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The teacher will just say, get it into an integral just to kind of see whether you know how to convolute things and get your solution to the differential equation at least into this form, because from here it really is just, I won't say basic calculus, but it's non-differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully, this <EXPRESSION> example with the convolution to solve an inverse transform clarified things up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're ready to begin Lecture <EXPRESSION>, and what I'm going to begin with is by finishing up some things from last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll talk about approximations, and I want to fill in a number of comments and get you a little bit more oriented in the point of view that I'm trying to express about approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all, I want to remind you of the actual applied example that I wrote down last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was this business here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There was something from special relativity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the approximation that we used was the linear approximation, with a <EXPRESSION> power that comes out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to reiterate why this is a useful way of thinking of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why this is that this comes up in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why this is maybe more important than everything that I've taught you about technically so far.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you work that out, this is approximately the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is this saying?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is saying that if you have this satellite, which is going at speed <EXPRESSION>, and little <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light, then the change in the watch down here on earth, relative to the time on the satellite, is going to be proportional to this ratio here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, physically, this makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is time divided by time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is velocity squared divided by velocity squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in each case, the units divide out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a dimensionless quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a dimensionless quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the only point here that we're trying to make is just this notion of proportionality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to write this down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just, in summary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the error fraction, if you like, which is sort of the number of significant digits that we have in our measurement, is proportional, in this case, to this quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens to be proportional to this quantity here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the factor is, happens to be, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these proportionality factors are what we're looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Their rates of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Their rates of change of something with respect to something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, on your homework, you have something rather similar to this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the speed of the pitch is changing depending on how high the mound is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the point here is that that's approximately proportional to the change in the height of the mound.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what you're trying to figure out is what the constant of proportionality is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what you're aiming for in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a linear relationship, approximately, to all intents and purposes this is an equality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the lower order terms are unimportant for the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just as over here, this function is a little bit complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This function is a little more simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the purposes of this problem, they are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the errors are negligible for the particular problem that we're working on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we might as well work with the simpler relationship.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, over here, so you could do this with, in this case with square roots, it's not so hard here with reciprocals of square roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also not terribly hard to do it numerically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason why we're not doing it numerically is that, as I say, this is something that happens all across engineering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "People are looking for these linear relationships between the change in some input and the change in the output.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case the design of the satellite, it's very important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The speed actually isn't just <EXPRESSION> speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's the relative speed of u to the satellite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might be, it depends on your angle of sight with the satellite what the speed is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it varies quite a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you really need this rule of thumb.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then there are all kinds of other considerations in this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like, for example, there's the fact that we're sitting on Earth and so we're rotating around on what's called a non-inertial frame.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the question of that acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the question that the gravity that I experience here on Earth is not the same as up at the satellite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that also creates a difference in time, as a result of general relativity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all of these considerations come down to formulas which are this complicated or maybe a tiny bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not really that much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then people simplify them enormously to these very simple-minded rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they don't keep track of what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to design the system, you must make these simplifications, otherwise you can't even think about what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This comes up in everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In weather forecasting, economic forecasting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Figuring out whether there's going to be an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Every single <EXPRESSION> of these things involves dozens of these considerations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, there was a question that I saw, here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Basically, any problem where you have a derivative, the rate of change also depends upon what the base point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, this varies a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that's sort of a <EXPRESSION> order effect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does change the constant of proportionality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a rate of change at a different base point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which we're considering fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you actually do the computations, what you discover is that it doesn't make that much difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To the a.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's something that you get from experience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That it turns out, which things matter and which things don't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And yet again, that's exactly the same sort of consideration but at the next order of what I'm talking about here is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to have enough experience with numbers to know that if you take, if you vary something a little bit it's not going to change the answer that you're looking for very much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly the point that I'm making.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can't make them all at once, all such points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's my pitch for understanding things from this point of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we're going to go on, now, to quadratic approximations, which are a little more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we talked a little bit about this last time but I didn't finish.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to finish this up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, that's something that you really need to get a little experience with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In economics, I told you they use logarithms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a mess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And people don't do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they stick with the quadratic ones, typically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the basic formula here, and I'm going to take the base point to be <EXPRESSION>, is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the linear part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus this extra term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is supposed to work for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it shows in the base point as simply as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's more or less where we left off last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> thing that I said I was going to explain, which I will now, is why it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need to know that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's work that out here <EXPRESSION> of all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm just going to do it by example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you like, the answer is just, well, what happens when you have a parabola?", "entities": []}
{"text": "A parabola's a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It had better, its quadratic approximation had better be itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's got to be the best <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's got to be itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this formula, if it's going to work, has to work on the nose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For quadratic functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I differentiate, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I differentiate a <EXPRESSION> time, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's plug it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can recover, what is it that we want to recover?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to recover these numbers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> using the derivatives evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's pretty easy, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's on the nose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you plug in <EQUATION><EQUATION>here, these terms drop out and you get a.", "entities": [{"id": 6247, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And now, <EXPRESSION>, whoops that was wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I wrote <EXPRESSION> but what I meant was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's back up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so if I plug in <EQUATION> I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6256, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION>, that's this next formula here, <EXPRESSION>, I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's also good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly what the linear approximation is supposed to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now you notice, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to recover <EXPRESSION>, I better take half of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the reason.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's no chance that any other formula could work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the explanation for the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I remind you that I had a collection of basic formulas written on the board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to just make sure we know all of them again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all, there was <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those were <EXPRESSION> that I mentioned last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, again, this is all for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION> only.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are wildly wrong, Far away, but near <EXPRESSION> they're nice, good, quadratic approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the other <EXPRESSION> approximations that I want to mention are the logarithm and we use the base point shifted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can put it at <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> - sorry, this is an approximately = sign there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the last <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, eventually, your mind will converge on all of these and you'll find them relatively easy to memorize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it'll take some getting used to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm not claiming that you should recognize them and understand them all now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to put a giant box around this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question was, you get all of these if you use that equation there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly what are you going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "so I already did it actually for these <EXPRESSION>, last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I didn't do it yet for these <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I will do it in about <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, maybe <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> I want to explain just a few things about these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They all follow from the basic formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that <EXPRESSION> deserves a pink box too, doesn't it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION>'s pretty important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe even some little sparkles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's pretty important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Almost as important as the more basic <EXPRESSION> without this term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let me just tell you a little bit more about the significance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is just to reinforce something that we've already done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's closely related to what you're doing on your problem set.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's worth your while to recall this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there's this expression that we were dealing with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we talked about it in lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we showed in lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way that we did that was, we took the logarithm and we wrote it as <EXPRESSION> times, sorry, the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6297, "label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "And then we evaluated the limit of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to do this limit again, using linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To show you how easy it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you just remember the linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll explain where the quadratic approximation comes in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claim that this is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, why is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just this linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did I use here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6302, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "That's what I used in this approximation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the linear approximation to the natural logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this number is relatively easy to evaluate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same, well, so where does this work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This works where this thing is near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This thing is working only when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what it's really saying, this approximation formula, it's really saying that as we go to <EXPRESSION>, in <EXPRESSION>, this thing is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what it's saying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the substance there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's how we want to use it, in many instances.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to evaluate limits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We also want to realize that it's nearby when <EXPRESSION> is pretty large, like <EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so that's the idea of the linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you want to get the rate of convergence here, so the rate of what's called convergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So convergence means how fast this is going towards that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I have to do is take the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to take ln ak, and I have to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "entities": [{"id": 6317, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "And I know that this is going to <EXPRESSION>, and the question is how big is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want it to be very small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer we're going to get, so the answer just uses the quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I just have a little bit more detail, then this expression here, in other words, I have the next higher order term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is like <EXPRESSION>, this is like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I can understand how big the difference is between the expression that I've got and its limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's what's on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is on your problem set.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that is more or less an explanation for <EXPRESSION> of the things that quadratic approximations are good for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to give you <EXPRESSION> more illustration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> more illustration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll actually check these formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, in real life when you're faced with a problem like this, where some satellite is orbiting and you want to know the effects of gravity or something like that, nobody is going to tell you anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're not even going to tell you whether a linear approximation is relevant, or a quadratic or anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're on your own.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I give you a question, at least for right now, I'm always going to tell you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as time goes on I'd like you to get used to when it's enough to get away with a linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you should only use a quadratic approximation if somebody forces you to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You should always start trying with a linear <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the quadratic ones are much more complicated as you'll see in this next example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the example that I want to use is, you're going to be stuck with it because I'm asking for the quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is the same function that we used in the last lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this was it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, unfortunately, I stuck it in the wrong place to be able to fit this very long formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to switch it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to write it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to just do the approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to say quadratic, in parentheses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll say <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6331, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So that's what I want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's what I have to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have to write in the quadratic approximation for <EXPRESSION>, and I'm going to use this formula right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other factor, I'm going to have to use this formula down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> term, and this is the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to do something which is the only good thing about quadratic approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're messy, they're long, there's nothing particularly good about them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there is <EXPRESSION> good thing about them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that you always get to ignore the higher order terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So even though this looks like a very ugly multiplication, I can do it in my head.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just watching it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I get a <EXPRESSION>, I'm forced with that term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I get the cross terms which are linear, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already did that when we calculated the linear approximation, so that's this times the <EXPRESSION> and this times that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 112, "end_offset": 117}, {"id": 6345, "label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "And now I have <EXPRESSION> cross-terms which are quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6350, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's this term, multiplying the <EXPRESSION>, that's plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 69}, {"id": 6355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "Multiplying <EXPRESSION>, and that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6359, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So the great thing is, we drop <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": [{"id": 6361, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And you work it out as I'm doing it now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I did is, I multiplied <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6364, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "I'm using the distributive law here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I multiplied this <EXPRESSION> by this <EXPRESSION>, that was that term.", "entities": [{"id": 6368, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "I multiplied this by this, that's that term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I multiplied this by this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EXPRESSION> terms that gave me an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to stop at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the point is it's just all the rest of the terms that come up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have to do the higher ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question, way back here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So somebody can check my arithmetic, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if here's about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's something which is on the order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the point is that I'm not claiming that I have an exact answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to drop things of that order of magnitude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm saving everything up to <EXPRESSION> decimal places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm throwing away things which are <EXPRESSION> decimal places out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that answer your question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the situation, and now you can combine the terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it's not very impressive here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = <EXPRESSION>, maybe <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is a <EXPRESSION> here, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the linear approximation we got last time and here's the extra information that we got from this calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is this <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, you have to accept that there's a certain degree of complexity to this problem and the answer is sufficiently complicated so it can't be less arithmetic because we get this peculiar <EXPRESSION> there, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of the things to realize is that these kinds of problems, because they involve many, many terms are always going to involve a little bit of complicated arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Did the ones in the left column.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's carry that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as someone just pointed out, it all comes from this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just check it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll start with the ln function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the function, <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have to plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6400, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So at <EQUATION> this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm getting <EXPRESSION> here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6410, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So now I go and I look up at that formula, which is way in that upper corner there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I see that the coefficient on the constant is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The coefficient on <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other coefficient, the very last <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the formula, there's a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's half of whatever I get for this <EXPRESSION> derivative, at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the approximation formula, which is way up in that corner there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, if I do it for <EXPRESSION>, I have to differentiate that I get <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here are the derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if I evaluate them at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, I plug in <EQUATION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So again, the pattern is right above it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is there, the <EXPRESSION> is there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then instead of <EXPRESSION>, I have half that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the coefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are just examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Obviously if we had a more complicated functional, we might carry this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as a practical matter, we try to stick with the ones in the pink box and just use algebra to get other formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to shift gears now and treat the subject that was supposed to be this lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're not quite caught up, but we will try to do our best to do as much as we can today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next topic is curve sketching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so let's get started with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, happily in this subject, there are more pictures and it's a little bit more geometric.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's relatively little computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's hope we can do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to, so here we go, we'll start with curve sketching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, there are certain kinds of things which I can't spell.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sketching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's our goal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our goal is to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>, using <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6437, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Whether they're positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the goal here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, there is a big warning that I want to give you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is <EXPRESSION> that unfortunately I now have to make you unlearn, especially those that you that have actually had a little bit of calculus before, I want to make you unlearn some of your instincts that you developed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this will be harder for those of you who have actually done this before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for the rest of you, it will be relatively easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, don't abandon your precalculus skills.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And common sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a great deal of common sense in this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it actually trumps some of the calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The calculus just fills in what you didn't quite know yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will try to illustrate this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And because we're running a bit late, I won't get to the some of the main punchlines until next lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want you to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for now, I'm just going to tell you about the general principles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the process I'm going to introduce the terminology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just, the words that we need to use to describe what is that we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's also a certain amount of carelessness with that in many of the treatments that you'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a lot of hastiness.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just be a little patient and we will do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> principle is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a straightforward idea, and it's closely related to this tangent line approximation or the linear approximation that I just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can just imagine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the tangent line, here's the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if the tangent line is pointing up, then the function is also going up, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's all that's going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the basic idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the <EXPRESSION> step is also fairly straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have <EXPRESSION> as positive, then that means that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same principle applied <EXPRESSION> step up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if <EXPRESSION> is positive, that means it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the same principle just repeated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I just want to draw a picture of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's a picture of it, I claim.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it looks like something's going down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I did that on purpose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there is something that's increasing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, the slope is very steep negative here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's less steep negative over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the slope which is some negative number, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's getting less negative, and maybe eventually it'll curve up the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a picture of what I'm talking about here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it means to say that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope is getting larger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way to describe a curve like this is that it's concave.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is concave up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, <EXPRESSION> negative is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION> concave, or implies <EXPRESSION> concave down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those are the ways in which derivatives will help us qualitatively to draw graphs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as I said before, we still have to use a little bit of common sense when we draw the graphs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are just the additional bits of help that we have from calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In drawing pictures.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to go through <EXPRESSION> example to introduce all the notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then eventually, so probably at the beginning of next time, I'll give you a systematic strategy that's going to work when what I'm describing now goes wrong, or a little bit wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's begin with a straightforward example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> example that I'll give you is the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just, as I said, to be able to introduce all the notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you differentiate it, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can factor that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, I can decide whether the derivative is positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Easily enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a positive number and <EXPRESSION> is a positive number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this range, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing is, so <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, in the other ranges, if <EXPRESSION> is very, very large, this becomes, if it crosses <EXPRESSION>, in fact, this becomes, this factor becomes negative and this <EXPRESSION> stays positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is decreasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same thing goes for the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When it's less than <EXPRESSION>, that also works this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because when it's less than <EXPRESSION>, this number factors positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the other <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in both of these cases, we get that it's decreasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's the schematic picture of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's <EXPRESSION>, here's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to go down, up, down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll just leave it alone like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is the kind of information we can get right off the bat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you notice immediately that it's very important, from the features of the function, the sort of key features of the function that we see here, are these <EXPRESSION> places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll even mark them in a, like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these things are turning points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what are they?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, they're just the points where the derivative changes sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where it's negative here and it's positive there, so there it must be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have a definition, and this is the most important definition in this subject, which is that is if <EXPRESSION>, we call <EXPRESSION> a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The word 'turning point' is not used just because, in fact, it doesn't have to turn around at those points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But certainly, if it turns around then this will happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we also have another notation, which is the number <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION> is called a critical value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the key numbers that we're going to have to work out in order to understand what the function looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do is just plot them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to plot the critical points and the values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we found the critical points relatively easily.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I didn't write it down here but it's pretty obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you set <EQUATION>, that implies that <EQUATION>, which implies that <EXPRESSION> is or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6486, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "So those are known as the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, in order to get the critical values here, I have to plug in <EXPRESSION>, for instance, the function is <EXPRESSION>, so there's this <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6491, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I can plot the function here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the point <EXPRESSION> and here's, up here, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is - whoops, which <EXPRESSION> is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then over here, I have the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, now, what information do I get from - so I've now plotted <EXPRESSION>, I claim, very interesting points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What information do I get from this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, I know something very nearby.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I've already checked that the thing is coming down from the left, and coming back up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so it must be shaped like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The tangent line is <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be level there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly over here, it's going to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what we know so far, based on what we've computed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is, calculus, it's not called a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a very important point, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will be discussing those kinds of points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are much more dramatic instances of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's part of what we're going to say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I just want to save that, alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will be discussing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is that I actually did not use the <EXPRESSION> derivative yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I used is another piece of information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used the information that I derived over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION> is positive, where <EXPRESSION> is positive and where it's negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I know is that the graph is going down to the left of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going up to the right, here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going up here and it's going down there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did not use the <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used the <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, but I didn't just use the fact that there was a turning point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, I was using the fact that it was a turning point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wasn't using the fact that it had the <EXPRESSION> derivative, though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can also see it by the <EXPRESSION> derivative as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the next thing that I'd like to do, I need to finish off this graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just want to do it a little bit carefully here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the order that is reasonable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you might happen to notice, and there's nothing wrong with this, so let's even fill in a guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order to fill in a guess, though, and have it be even vaguely right, I do have to notice that this thing crosses, this function crosses the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The function <EQUATION> happens also have the property that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, common sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're allowed to use your common sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're allowed to notice a value of the function and put it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's nothing wrong with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you happen to have such a value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now we can guess what our function is going to look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to maybe come down like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Come up like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And come down like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That could be what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you know, another possibility is it sort of comes along here and goes out that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Comes along here and goes out that way, who knows?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens, by the way, that it's an odd function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are all odd powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, it's symmetric on the right half and the left half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And crosses at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So everything that we do on the right is going to be the same as what happens on the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's another piece of common sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You want to make use of that as much as possible, whenever you're drawing anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't want to throw out information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this function happens to be odd.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Odd, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm considering those to be kinds of precalculus skills that I want you to use as much as you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's the <EXPRESSION> feature which is unfortunately ignored in most discussions of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's strange, because nowadays we have graphing things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's really the only part of the exercise that you couldn't do, at least on this relatively simpleminded level, with a graphing calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is what I would call the ends of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens off the screen, is the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that basically is the theoretical part of the problem that you have to address.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can program this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can draw all the pictures that you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what you won't see is what's off the screen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You need to know something to figure out what's off the screen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this case, I'm talking about what's off the screen going to the right, or going to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's check the ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, let's just take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have the function <EXPRESSION>, which is, sorry, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again this is a precalculus sort of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're imagining now, let's just do <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> is gigantic, this term is completely negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it just behaves like <EXPRESSION>, which goes to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's have we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I guess we can just say <EQUATION> if we didn't want to write it with the function notation.", "entities": [{"id": 6536, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And that's all fair and well and this works out well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a separable differential equation and we can integrate things quite easily.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as you will see as you go further in the world of differential equations, most differential equations are not so easy to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, many of them are impossible to solve using analytic methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so given that, what do you do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've nicely described some phenomena, modeled some phenomena using the differential equations but if you can't solve it analytically do you just give up?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer to that question is no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You do not just give up because we now have computers, and computers are really good at numerical methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Numerical methods for approximating and giving us a sense of what the solution to a differential equation might look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in this video we can explore <EXPRESSION> of the most straightforward numerical methods for approximating a particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we do is, so I'm gonna draw a little table here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a little table here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let give myself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm gonna do it over here on the left hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A little table.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could set up a table like this to create a slope field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could just pick all the.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're gonna do something kind of related but instead of trying to construct a slope field, we're gonna start with this initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6548, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "So we're gonna start with <EQUATION> and let me do this in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna start with <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that point right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're gonna say, well, okay what is the derivative at that point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know the derivative at any point that's for any solution to this differential equation the derivative is going to be = the <EXPRESSION> value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this case, the derivative is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in general, if the derivative just like what we saw in the case of slope fields, as long as the derivative is expressed as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then you can figure out what the slope of the tangent line will be at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, you say okay, there's a slope of <EXPRESSION> at that point so I can depict it like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And instead of just keep doing that with a bunch of points we'll say okay, well let's just.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the slope is changing or it's probably changing for most cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just assume it's fixed until our next <EXPRESSION> and then use that assumption to estimate what the next <EXPRESSION> would be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what am I talking about here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when I talk about the next <EXPRESSION> we're talking about well, let's just step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just say for the sake of simplicity, we're gonna have a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're gonna step from <EQUATION> now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna now step from that to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're now gonna go to.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I may not use that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used that yellow color already for the actual graph or for the actual <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6580, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've just added <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we can do in our little approximation scheme here is well, let's just assume that that slope was constant over that interval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where does that get us to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then <EXPRESSION> is going to increase by <EXPRESSION> and is going to get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we see that point right over there and you already might see where this is going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if this were actually a point on the curve, on the solution, and if it was satisfying this, what would then the derivative be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the derivative = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope of the tangent line is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this case, the slope of the tangent line is now going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we could depict that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me depict that in magenta here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's gonna look.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the slope of the tangent line there is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, what does that tell us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well if we step by our <EXPRESSION> more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Set <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6602, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "What should the corresponding <EXPRESSION> be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now for every <EXPRESSION> that we increase in the <EXPRESSION> direction we should increase <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction because the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the very next <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we could imagine we have now kind of had a constant slope when we get to that point right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can do the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well if we assume <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> based on the differential equation it has to be = <EXPRESSION>, okay, the slope of the tangent line there is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, if we step our <EXPRESSION> up by <EXPRESSION>, if we increment our <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> again, once again, we just decided to increment by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could have incremented by <EXPRESSION>, we could have incremented by.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could guess which <EXPRESSION>'s going to give you a more accurate result.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if we step up by <EXPRESSION> now and our slope is <EXPRESSION>, well, we're gonna increase by.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we increase <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> we're gonna increase <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we are going to get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we are at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION> which is right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, for this next stretch, the next stretch is going to look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you can see just by doing this, we haven't been able to approximate what the particular solution looks like and you might say, 'Hey, so how do we know 'that's not so good of an approximation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "' And my reply to you is well, yeah I mean, depends on what your goals are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I did this by hand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I didn't even do this using a computer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And because I wanted to do it by hand I took fairly large <EXPRESSION> steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I wanted a better approximation I could have lowered the <EXPRESSION> and let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take another scenario.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do another scenario where instead of <EQUATION>, let's say <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6638, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "So once again, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's say I want to take.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know this <EXPRESSION> point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're given this initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and so the slope of the tangent line is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then if we're incrementing by <EXPRESSION> so then when <EXPRESSION> is, I'll just write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is our new <EXPRESSION> going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well we're gonna assume that our slope from this to this is this slope right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our slope is <EXPRESSION>, so if we increase <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get to that point right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually you're having trouble seeing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This stuff right over here is this point right over here and now our new slope is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is going to look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is going to look like actually not quite that steep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to overstate how good an approximation is and it's starting to get a little bit messy but it's gonna look something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what you would see if you kept doing this process, so if your slope is now <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, when you increment <EXPRESSION> by another <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> where you get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now if you increment by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and your slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, your <EXPRESSION> is going to increment by half of that by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and so, you're gonna get to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now you get to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> which is this point right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, this is a better approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, in the original <EXPRESSION> Y of <EXPRESSION> you know should be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> on and on and on and on and on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now in this <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> got us to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> got us to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, closer to the actual reality, closer to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of stepping by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, if we stepped by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> we would get even closer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we stepped by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> we would get even closer and closer and closer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a bunch of interesting things here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually how most differential equations or techniques that are derived from this or that are based on numerical methods similar to this are how most differential equations gets solved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know it's not the exact same solution or the same method that the idea that most differential equations are actually solved or I guess you can say simulated with a numerical method because most of them actually cannot be solved in analytical form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now you might be saying, 'Hey, well what method is 'this <EXPRESSION> right over here called?", "entities": []}
{"text": "' Well, this right over here is called Euler's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Euler's Method after the famous Leonhard Euler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Euler's Method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hopefully you found that exciting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I introduce you to the concept of exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's just another method for solving a certain type of differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before I show you what an exact equation is, I'm just going to give you a little bit of the building blocks, just so that when I later prove it, or at least give you the intuition behind it, it doesn't seem like it's coming out of the blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I had some function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and we'll call it <EXPRESSION>, just because that's what people tend to use for these exact equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're probably not familiar with taking the chain rule onto partial derivatives, but I'll show it to you now, and I'll give you a little intuition, although I won't prove it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Undo.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could also write this as <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could write it just like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are just <EXPRESSION> different ways of writing the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I won't prove it, but I'll give you the intuition right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is should make a little bit of intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if these canceled out, then you'd kind of have another partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you were to kind of add them up, then you would get the full derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not even the intuition, that's just to show you that even this should make a little bit of intuitive sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the intuition here, let's just say <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> doesn't always have to take this form, but you could use this same methodology to take <EXPRESSION> to more complex notations.", "entities": [{"id": 6734, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "But let's say that <EXPRESSION>, and I won't write that it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6738, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "We know that it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say it's = some function of <EXPRESSION>, we'll call that <EXPRESSION>, times some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6745, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And let's say there's a bunch of terms like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just defined <EXPRESSION> like this just so I can give you the intuition that when I use implicit differentiation on this, when I take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, I actually get something that looks just like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is just the implicit differentiation that you learned, or that you hopefully learned, in your <EXPRESSION> semester calculus course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's =, and we just do the product rule, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> expression, you take the derivative of that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION> function, well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now you add that to the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function times the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So plus <EXPRESSION>, that's just the <EXPRESSION> function, times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": [{"id": 6762, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 6763, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "Now the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function, it's going to be this function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, we're doing the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might want to review the implicit differentiation videos if that seems a little bit foreign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this right here, what I just did, this expression right here, this is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have <EXPRESSION> terms like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we keep adding them, I'll do them vertically down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So plus, and then you have a bunch of them, and the last <EXPRESSION>'s going to look the same, it's just the nth function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> function, <EXPRESSION>, plus the <EXPRESSION> function, <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": [{"id": 6778, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 67}, {"id": 6779, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 6780, "label": "command", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 114}]}
{"text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we have <EXPRESSION> n terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION> terms here, right, where each term was a <EXPRESSION> times a <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, and then all the way to fn of <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6792, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 80}, {"id": 6793, "label": "command", "start_offset": 157, "end_offset": 162}]}
{"text": "Now for each of those, we got <EXPRESSION> of them when we did the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we group the terms, so if we group all the terms that don't have a <EXPRESSION> on them, what do we get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we add all of these, I guess you could call them on the left hand side, I'm just rearranging, it all = <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, all the way to <EXPRESSION>e, I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6802, "label": "command", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 124}]}
{"text": "That's just all of these added up, plus all of these added up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the terms that have the <EXPRESSION> in them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do them in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all of these terms are going to be in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it in a different parentheses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>, and I'll do the <EXPRESSION> later, I'll distribute it out.", "entities": [{"id": 6806, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "Plus, and we have <EXPRESSION> terms, plus <EXPRESSION>, and then all of these terms are multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6810, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 6811, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 6812, "label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"text": "Now, something looks interesting here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We originally defined our <EXPRESSION>, up here, as this right here, but what is this green term?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what we did is we took all of these individual terms, and these green terms here are just taking the derivative with respect to just <EXPRESSION> on each of these terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you take the derivative just with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this, then the function of <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you were to take just a partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you took the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this term, you treat a function of <EXPRESSION> as a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of this would just be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, because <EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so forth and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of these green terms you can view as a partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just pretended like <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that same logic, if you ignore this, if you just look at this part right here, what is this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We took <EXPRESSION>, up here, we treated the functions of <EXPRESSION> as a constant, and we just took the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's why the primes are on all the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could write this, this = I'll do this green this green is the same thing as the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus, what's this purple, this part of the purple?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in a different color, in magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This, right here, is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's essentially all I wanted to show you right now in this video, because I realize I'm almost running out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the chain rule, with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the variables, but the <EXPRESSION> variable in the function is also a function of <EXPRESSION>, the chain rule is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> wasn't a function of <EXPRESSION>, or if <EXPRESSION> if it was independent of <EXPRESSION>, than <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this term would be <EXPRESSION>, and then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> would be just the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, I want you to just keep this in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this video I didn't prove it, but I hopefully gave you a little intuition if I didn't confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to use this property in the next series of videos to understand exact equations a little bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I realize that in this video I just got as far as kind of giving you an intuition here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't told you yet what an exact equation is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation: the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6862, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So you might say, wow, this is a tremendously complicated problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have the <EXPRESSION> types of functions I've been exposed to, I would have so many undetermined coefficients, it would get really unwieldy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where you need to make a simplifying realization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the <EXPRESSION> particular solutions to the following differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then let me just write this out a couple of times <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6866, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "We know the solution to this one, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was another particular solution we found.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it was <EXPRESSION> videos ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The particular solution was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then finally this last polynomial, we could call it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the solution when that was just the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we figured out and this was in the last video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know the particular solution when <EXPRESSION> on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 6871, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "We know it when just <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 6873, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 59}]}

{"text": "And we know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 6877, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "First of all, the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation, we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because one of the particular solutions, like this one when you put it on the left hand side, it will just = this term.", "entities": [{"id": 6878, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "This particular solution, when you put it in the left hand side, will = this term.", "entities": [{"id": 6879, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "Set the left hand side to = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6882, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 6883, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "And then you could add the homogeneous solution to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put it in the left side and you'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 6886, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "So it won't change the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me clean up some space because I want everything to be on the board at the same time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution is going to be well, I want that to be deleted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it in baby blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation, if this was a 0 on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 6887, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"text": "And then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video, where we'll start learning another method for solving nonhomogeneous equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, what do I get?", "entities": [{"id": 6889, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 6890, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So when I exponentiate that, it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6895, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did we arrive at?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We arrived at the van der Waals equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's write both of them.", "entities": [{"id": 6896, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Well, let me write <EXPRESSION>, and this is just the definition of the transform, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6899, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 18}]}

{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we take the derivative of this, <EXPRESSION> cancels out, and you just get that.", "entities": [{"id": 6906, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "And then if we make our <EXPRESSION> let me pick a good color here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we make this = our <EXPRESSION>, what's our <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6913, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's apply the integration by parts.", "entities": [{"id": 6914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 6915, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6917, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, I'll use this <EXPRESSION>, so <EQUATION>, that's our <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write this down so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6925, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Let me do it in that color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just rewriting this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the <EXPRESSION> term right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me make that clear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me pick a good color here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this term right here is this term right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, I'm going to have to evaluate this from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me write that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6931, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "I could put a little bracket there or something, but you know we're going to have to evaluate that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then from that, we're going to have to subtract the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me not forget our boundaries.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, we have our <EXPRESSION>, and you have a minus minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These things become pluses.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you've evaluate what's the limit of this as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, this term, you might say, oh, this becomes really big.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I went over this in the last video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this term overpowers it, because you're going to have <EXPRESSION>, if we assume that <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>, this term is going to win out and go to <EXPRESSION> much faster than this term is going to go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, when you evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, you're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you're going to subtract this evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6950, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "This evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, when it's evaluated at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this becomes <EXPRESSION> as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this whole term evaluated from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> is all <EXPRESSION>, which is a nice, convenient thing for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're going to have this next term right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take out the constant terms.", "entities": [{"id": 6958, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> are constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are constant with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this should look reasonably familiar to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, when we have an <EXPRESSION>, we're taking the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, so this whole integral = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just that easily, because this term went to <EXPRESSION>, we've simplified things integral right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is a nice, neat simplification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if we can use this with this information to get a generalized formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write that down <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "I could write this as <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>, where <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6975, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Well, we can just use this formula up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, t, we know what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can do another one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we just use this formula up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just this right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's = <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to actually write it this way, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you already are getting the idea of what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just <EXPRESSION> this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you can just get the general principle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can prove this by induction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's almost trivial based on what we've already done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's let <EQUATION>, that's a natural quantity to look at, right?", "entities": [{"id": 6987, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "And that is between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, it's just a fraction of white balls in the population.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "That's not a random variable, but that's sort of a traditional statistics notation sometimes, for the population size, is capital <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sample size is lowercase <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6995, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "Let's say, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 6997, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So transforming from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> by multiplying some function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7001, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "We need to make some assumptions on <EXPRESSION>, if <EXPRESSION> is a really nasty function then this may not work out very well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we multiply <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And I just have to explain the notation a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we transformed capital <EXPRESSION> to capital <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a natural thing to do is to mirror that notation with the lowercase letters.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We define <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7010, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So we're doing the same transformation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So all I'm saying to do is plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7014, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> viewed as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are several variations on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, you can also do <EXPRESSION> is the same.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So that says we have a choice in doing this we can decide which is easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either we could do <EXPRESSION> directly, or we could take <EXPRESSION> and flip it.", "entities": [{"id": 7030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}, {"id": 7031, "label": "method", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "And then we just have to remember to write it as a function of <EXPRESSION>, either way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Strictly increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a common mistake on this kind of problem would be to just try to blindly plug into this formula for a function like <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7034, "label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "Now if <EQUATION> is a very, very nice function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not saying that's not a nice function, it's a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because then the negative side doesn't come into play.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't just plug into the formula all without checking the assumptions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so let's prove this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the proof should be pretty easy, just based on kind of similar calculations we did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like, in a sense, this is easier than Universality, or things like that, that we've done before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna take the derivative, that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that pretty quickly.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So over here, let's just compute the derivative, <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we just need to be careful about do we multiply it by <EXPRESSION> here or <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"id": 7048, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "But that says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the reciprocal of this, so we're gonna just put a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's gonna be the PDF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way if you ever forget whether this is <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> well, I mean it shouldn't take long to rederive it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you may have been taught that it's not ok to separate the <EXPRESSION> from the <EXPRESSION>, but when you go further in math then people start separating them again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as long as you're careful about what things mean it is possible to do that if you interpret it correctly, but I just think of that as an amonic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does that actually mean?", "entities": []}

{"text": "All right, so I just have to tell you what this thing means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> = just to write it out.", "entities": [{"id": 7060, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "It's a matrix of all possible partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> other calculus thing that we should discuss briefly is convolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want, so let's let <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7063, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're assuming that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are independent here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's much nastier if they're dependent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll replace <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7069, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "This is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the easiest way to remember this result is by thinking by analogy, with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, that's not a proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just an analogy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the new homework, you'll see an example where if you try to reason kind of an analogous way for a product, instead of a sum, well, you'll see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This requires more justification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are several ways to justify this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7071, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And once we've plugged in <EQUATION>, we can drop the condition because <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are independent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now take the derivative of both sides of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then there's a theorem that says you can swap the derivative and the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something that, you can see whether you agree with me or not but, this is something that beauty is not really an adequate word for, this is not something I would consider existential, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's an idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So suppose we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we started last week on the big topic for the rest of the semester, optimization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe can you close that door or just part way anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's perfect, just like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, since it was a few days ago, I wanted to recap what I did in the first lecture about optimization, which was to pick out the least squares problem as a beautiful model problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We would like to get <EQUATION> but we can't.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, right angles here mean transpose <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then tranpose <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7081, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "I'm going to graph <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7083, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it doesn't move.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would discover <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I solve derivative = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Lagrange's brilliant idea was that now I've got a function that I can my derivatives I can take.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could set the derivatives to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7097, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7100, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So we got now <EXPRESSION> equations, <EXPRESSION> unknown.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, we've gone from <EXPRESSION> up to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I can say what this thing really the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that what I'm getting?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This says <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>, and this one says <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION> equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, so I will help kill these = signs and just look at oh, that's a plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've got our saddle point matrix again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the nice thing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With right hand side set to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7116, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 7117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "That looks like a <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This looks like <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This looks like oh, wait a minute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can live with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> there, but it's not really what I wanted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted the signs to you know what I want here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want the transpose of that to be here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can take its derivative and you find out that it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that Lagrange multiplier, that's really a key message, is an important quantity in itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it happens to mean displacement, which is obviously crucial quantity, and in general it tells us the change in the minimum energy with respect to a change in the input.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That sensitivity's a natural word to use for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a final word about well, a near to final word about Lagrange multipliers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll see you Wednesday and by that time I'll know more about the projects and we'll be moving onward with optimization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A lot of what you'll learn in differential equations is really just different bags of tricks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this video I'll show you <EXPRESSION> of those tricks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's useful beyond this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's always good when, if maybe <EXPRESSION> day, you become a mathematician or a physicist, and you have an unsolved problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some of these tricks that solved simpler problems back in your education might be a useful trick that solves some unsolved problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's good to see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you're taking differential equations, it might be on an exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's good to learn.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll learn about integrating factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say, we have an equation that has this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this is my differential equation <EXPRESSION> I'm trying to write it neatly as possible <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So, especially since we've covered this in recent videos, whenever you see an equation of this form where you have some function of <EXPRESSION>, then you have another function of <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, you said, oh, this looks like this could be an exact differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how do we test that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can take the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we could call this function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We set <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "And in order for this to have been an exact differential equation, the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> would have to = the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we see here, just by looking at these two, they don't = each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're not =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at least superficially, the way we looked at it just now, this is not an exact differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what if there were some factor, or I guess some function that we could multiply both sides of this equation by, that would make it an exact differential equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I want to do is I want to multiply both sides of this equation by some function <EXPRESSION>, and then see if I can solve for that function <EXPRESSION> that would make it exact.", "entities": [{"id": 7152, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 7153, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "So let's try to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7155, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7157, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And just as a simplification, <EXPRESSION> could be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be a function of just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be function of just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll assume it's just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could assume it's just a function of <EXPRESSION> and try to solve it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you could just assume it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you assume it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, it becomes a lot harder to solve for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that doesn't mean that there isn't <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7173, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "And I want to multiply it by both of these equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what's <EXPRESSION> times any function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's just going to be <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I did multiply the right hand side times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7184, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7185, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And remember what we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is when we multiply it, the goal is, after multiplying both sides of the equation by it, we should have an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, if we consider this whole thing our new <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION> should be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if we're taking the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> here, <EXPRESSION>, which is only a function of <EXPRESSION>, it's not a function of <EXPRESSION>, it's just a constant term, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We take a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant, or a function of <EXPRESSION> can be viewed just as a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, you could just say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, here, we'll use the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll take the derivative of the first expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is no longer a constant anymore, since we're taking the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the Greek letter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's for the muh sound, but it looks a lot like a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the product rule, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7217, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "So times ran out of space on that line <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now for this new equation, where I multiplied both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7220, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}, {"id": 7221, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "In order for this to be exact, these two things have to be = each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just remember the big picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're kind of saying, this is going to be exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, we're going to try to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if we can do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see, on this side, we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's subtract this expression from both sides.", "entities": [{"id": 7224, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7225, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see a lot of these differential equation problems that get kind of hairy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're really just a lot of algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that = what do we have left?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll write it in yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7228, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "That = I'm going to run out of space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do it a little bit lower.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That =, just this term right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see, if we factor out a <EXPRESSION> here, we get <EQUATION>, the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7236, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "Now, we can simplify this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's simplify <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7238, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So we set that to <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, = and I'm just going to simplify this side a little bit = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's factor out an <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"id": 7248, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And the reason why I'm doing that is because it seems like if I factor out an <EXPRESSION> here, I'll get an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why I did it, and I have this <EXPRESSION> on both sides equation, which I will now divide both sides by.", "entities": [{"id": 7254, "label": "command", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 100}, {"id": 7255, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "So if you divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, we could maybe assume that it's not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7258, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 7259, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "That simplifies things pretty dramatically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, just the way my brain works, I like to rewrite this expression just in our operator form, where instead of writing it <EXPRESSION>, we could write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could write <EQUATION>, the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7266, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And this is actually a separable differential equation in and of itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of a sub-differential equation to solve our broader one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're just trying to figure out the integrating factor right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7268, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 7269, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So we get <EXPRESSION>, this is just a separable equation now, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, let's divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7274, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 7277, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "I'm actually going to go horizontal right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>, you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7283, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 7284, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "Now, you could integrate both sides of this, and you'll get the <EQUATION>, et cetera, et cetera.", "entities": [{"id": 7286, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}, {"id": 7287, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "But it should be pretty clear from this that <EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're identical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you look at both sides of this equation there, you can just change <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>, and it becomes the other side.", "entities": [{"id": 7292, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "So, this is obviously telling us that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have our integrating factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you want, you can take the antiderivative of both sides with the natural logs, and all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll get the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is just, by looking at it, by inspection, you know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because both sides of this equation are completely the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, we now have our integrating factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I am running out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in the next video, we're now going to use this integrating factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Multiply it times our original differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make it exact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then solve it as an exact equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here I plug <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and that will give me <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7300, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "What is the velocity vector?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the velocity vector is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have to continue the calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I will write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7312, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, let me try to convince you of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, say I chose to instead go like this and then around like that, first I wouldn't do any work because here the force is perpendicular to my motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I would be going against the force all the way around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But here, see, I am not assuming, for example, that the particle is moving just based on that force.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe, actually, I am here to hold it in my hand and force it to go where it is going, or maybe there is some rail that is taking it in that trajectory or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can really do it along any trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if I wanted to, if I knew that was the case, I could try to find the trajectory based on what the force is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that is not what we are doing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to make sense of what you asked just a few minutes ago, what can we do directly with <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, when I replace <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7317, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we have to express everything in terms of that <EXPRESSION> parameter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we get a usual single variable integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we evaluate things in this language?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we do it by substituting the parameter into everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The method to evaluate is to express <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in terms of a single variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then substitute that variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's, for example, redo the one we had up there just using these new notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will see that it is the same calculation but with different notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we are integrating is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, see, if we have just this, we don't know how to integrate that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, well, you could try to come up with negative <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that actually doesn't make sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we will do is we will actually have to express everything in terms of a same variable, because it is a single integral and we should only have on variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what that variable will be, well, if we just do it the same way that would just be t.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we express everything in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we use the parametric equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know what to do with these two guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am just saying, in a different language, what I said over here with <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is the same thing but written slightly differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I am going to do it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to switch from <EXPRESSION> board to the next <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I can say, yes, this is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of that stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can simplify it a bit and <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>, and I can compute it, = <EXPRESSION>rd.", "entities": [{"id": 7347, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> and then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I plug <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "I plug <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> and so on.", "entities": [{"id": 7355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "And that is the general method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you are given a curve then you first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms of the same thing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you get to choose, in general, what parameter we use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You choose to parameterize your curve in whatever way you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can choose whichever variable you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you could get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you would be able to do it with a lot of trig and you would get the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be a harder way to get the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What you should do in practice is use the most reasonable way to parameterize your curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you know that you have a piece of parabola <EQUATION>, there is no way you would put <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could set <EQUATION>, which is very reasonable.", "entities": [{"id": 7363, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "You could even take a small shortcut and say that your variable will be just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EXPRESSION> you just keep as it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, when you have <EXPRESSION>, you set <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and then you will have an integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this one is not practical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you get to choose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have said here is how we compute it in general, and that is the general method for computing a line integral for work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can always do this, try to find a parameter, the simplest one, express everything in terms of its variable and then you have an integral to compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But sometimes you can actually save a lot of work by just thinking geometrically about what this all does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me tell you about the geometric approach.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can write vector <EQUATION>, but that is also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7372, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Suppose we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7375, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7377, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "OK, so if I multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Let's think about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I multiply by <EXPRESSION> on both the left and the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 7381, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 7383, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "Then on the left side, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the right side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's a very, very substantial cancellation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We cancel out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7387, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "And the only thing that's left is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I subtract, I get <EXPRESSION> on the left-hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 7390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7391, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "And on the right-hand side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7393, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7395, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And so I've got my formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this reasoning has one flaw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not complete.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this reasoning is basically correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's incomplete because it requires that <EXPRESSION> exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, it doesn't make any sense in the case <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example in the case <EQUATION>, we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when we multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7403, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And now you see that the subtraction gives us <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's really going on in the argument in this context.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's just nonsense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean it doesn't give us anything meaningful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this argument, it's great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION> term suddenly becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7407, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "And the anti-derivative of this next term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the next term is <EXPRESSION>, and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, let's plug <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7411, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "I'm going to add <EXPRESSION> to the right hand side.", "entities": [{"id": 7418, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 7419, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "And I'll plug in a <EQUATION> over here.", "entities": [{"id": 7421, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "On the other hand, I can do this for each value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the interpretation of this is that it's a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly this is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's really no distinction there, it's just I slipped it passed you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the notion of a power series is this idea that you put coefficients on a series, but then you allow yourself the flexibility to stick powers here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly what we're doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK there are other kinds of series where you stick other interesting functions in here like sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are lots of other series that people study.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are the simplest ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all those examples are extremely helpful for representing functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're only going to do this example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so here are the <EXPRESSION> rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there's only one other complication here which I have to explain to you before giving you a bunch of examples to show you that this works extremely well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, Differentiate <EXPRESSION> times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7432, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And you divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7434, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7436, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So let's just illustrate it <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7438, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "But now you see if I plug in <EQUATION>, I can pick off the <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": [{"id": 7441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And I evaluate <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So set all of those numerators to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7446, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 7447, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So this will actually make it easier for you to remember, rather than harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so with that, I'll leave the practice on differentiation for next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And good luck, everybody.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll talk to you individually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that we have passed the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see how that works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I take some path that starts at the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I want to go along this path from the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I want to compute for the line integral along that curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I want to do it for this vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will set <EQUATION> and also <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7450, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7453, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "It is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That integrates to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you prefer, that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to solve the equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want a function such that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just look at one of these at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we look at this one, well, we know how to solve this because it is just telling us we have to integrate this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> because I will have to refer to them again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's start with equation <EXPRESSION> and lets integrate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is not quite the end to it because there is an integration constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, when I say there is an integration constant, it just means the extra term does not depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is what it means to be a constant in this setting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe my constant still depends on y so it is not actually a true constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A constant that depends on <EXPRESSION> is not really a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is actually a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The good news that we have is that this function normally depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have made some progress.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have part of the answer and we have simplified the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have anything that looks like this, it will satisfy the first condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we need to look at the second condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want <EXPRESSION> to be that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we know what <EXPRESSION> is, so let's compute <EXPRESSION> from this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From this I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I get if I differentiate this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would like to match this with what I had.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I match this with equation two then that will tell me what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> should be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we compare the two things there, we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, the <EXPRESSION> go away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That tells you <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that integrates to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this time the constant is a true constant because g did not depend on anything other than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the constant does not depend on <EXPRESSION> so it is a real constant now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we just plug <EQUATION> back into this guy.", "entities": [{"id": 7481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Let's call him star.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we plug <EQUATION> into star, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7484, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Let's integrate this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will get another expression for f up to a constant that depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then let's match them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the difficulty is matching is actually quite tricky because you don't know in advance whether they will be the same expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is actually not a good way to do it, because if I put sufficiently complicated trig functions in there then you might not be able to see that two terms are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take an easy <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that here I have <EXPRESSION> and here I have a <EXPRESSION> then you might not actually notice that there is a difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there is no difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I am saying do it this way, don't do it any other way because there is a risk of making a mistake otherwise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, on the other hand, you could start with integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION> and then differentiate and match with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, here, of course, after we simplified there were only <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There were no <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is kind of good news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The format is first we do everything in two variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we will do three variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what happens with more than three will be left to your imagination.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other questions about either of these methods?", "entities": []}
{"text": "A quick poll.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Who prefers the first method?", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, it does require a little bit more attention.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's move on a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me start by actually doing a small recap.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the double integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7496, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 7497, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "We've seen various formulas for how to set up the double integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say that the coordinates of my vector field are, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the first thing we need to do is actually a simplification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's simplify <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7500, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So, instead of proving the divergence theorem, namely, the equality up there, I'm going to actually prove something easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7503, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "If you already have an <EXPRESSION>, I mean, there's not much risk for confusion, but still.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we're going to call <EXPRESSION> the shadow of my region instead.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I can't actually set up bounds for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I'm going to just leave it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you should get <EXPRESSION> back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's take the triple integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7510, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7511, "label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So, that means, remember, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, I will plug <EXPRESSION> into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7518, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "OK, any questions about this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it looking vaguely believable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We won't be able to do anything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, I integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7520, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And, what's the range for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we should be able to get <EXPRESSION> using the same method, negative partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, negative partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, there's a small catch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, we have to think of it carefully about orientations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, on the bottom face, we want <EXPRESSION> pointing down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Invert the signs in the left side.", "entities": [{"id": 7528, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 7529, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "And let's say that we have a curve <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7531, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Let's say that I give you <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7533, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And let's say that we have <EQUATION> <EQUATION> <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7537, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Let me write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7539, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Plug <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7542, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "We need <EXPRESSION> conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do it in order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do you remember these three conditions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is pretty easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, if you had a function of many more variables the criterion would still look exactly like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For every pair of components the mixed partials must be the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This you need to know so let me box it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do an example just to see how it goes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, we can also think of it in terms of differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before I do the example, let me just say we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "That is the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just in the language of differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The example that I promised.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, I could do again the same <EXPRESSION> over there and check that it satisfies the condition, but then it wouldn't be much fun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do a better <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let's do it in a way that looks like an exam problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7553, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "But it will fit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do it <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That seems to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me write them down <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7562, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Because otherwise I am going to get confused myself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other one has actually more steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, of course, here there are also a bit more steps because you have <EXPRESSION> parts to your path instead of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are going to look at them one at a time and get partial information on the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we will compare with the others to get more information until we are completely done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first thing we will do, we know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That should tell us something about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's just integrate that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write integral <EXPRESSION> next to that.", "entities": [{"id": 7569, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 7570, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "It means that for given values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> we will get a term that does not depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It still depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, what we get is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, if you took the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> you will get <EXPRESSION> and this guy will go away because there is no <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the first step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we need to get some information on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's integrate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7589, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7590, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "You start with <EXPRESSION> and you integrate that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives you <EXPRESSION> up to a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> only.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can choose whichever <EXPRESSION> you prefer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would encourage you to get some practice by trying both on least a couple of examples just to make sure that you know how to do them both and then stick to whichever one you prefer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions on that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I already asked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Still no questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Namely, talking about numerical methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to just carry out <EXPRESSION> example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I want to fill in <EXPRESSION> loose end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll talk about the unit overall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We were talking, last time, about numerical integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to illustrate this just with the simplest example that I can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to look at the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which we know perfectly well already is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you punch that into your calculator, you're going to get something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope I saved it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's more digits than we're going to get in our discussion here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, that's about how big this number is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the numerical integration methods will give you about as much accuracy as you can get on the function itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, some functions we may have more trouble approximating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the function <EXPRESSION>, we know pretty well how to do, because we know how to divide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So since the function that we're integrating here is <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be not too difficult to get some arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nevertheless, I'm going to do this in the simplest possible case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, just with <EXPRESSION> intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you really can't expect things to work so well with <EXPRESSION> intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a pretty ridiculous approximation to your function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you have <EXPRESSION> intervals, that means you're looking at the graph of this hyperbola.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So the idea that you can approximate the area just by knowing the values of <EXPRESSION> places is a little bit of a stretch of the imagination.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So the conclusion is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "The idea here is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This number here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EQUATION>, if we believe what we said on the last panel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that was the thing that I drew a picture of on the board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, the graph of <EXPRESSION> looked like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there was this asymptote, which was the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Now, I draw the graph of <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7633, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "This will be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some other level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to show you what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens is that the hump dies down a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the bump is just a little bit lower.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's going to look a little bit the same way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's just going to be a bit smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's another slice here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's just substitute <EQUATION> in.", "entities": [{"id": 7636, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So we know what gamma is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You integrate the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7639, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So what is it really doing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation: the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7642, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "So you might say, wow, this is a tremendously complicated problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have the <EXPRESSION> types of functions I've been exposed to, I would have so many undetermined coefficients, it would get really unwieldy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where you need to make a simplifying realization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the <EXPRESSION> particular solutions to the following differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the solution to this one, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was another particular solution we found.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it was <EXPRESSION> videos ago.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The particular solution was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then finally this last polynomial, we could call it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the solution when that was just the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we figured out and this was in the last video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know the particular solution when <EXPRESSION> on the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know it when just <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "entities": []}

{"text": "First of all, the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation, we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because one of the particular solutions, like this one when you put it on the left hand side, it will just = this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This particular solution, when you put it in the left hand side, will = this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Set the left hand side to = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"id": 7654, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 7655, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And then you could add the homogeneous solution to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put it in the left side and you'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it won't change the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me clean up some space because I want everything to be on the board at the same time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution is going to be well, I want that to be deleted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it in baby blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation, if this was a 0 on the right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.", "entities": []}

{"text": "This term would be <EXPRESSION>, so it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I would want to approximate it, I would want to create a polynomial that can approximate the function around this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this looks really complicated, but when you do some examples, you'll see it's not so bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you put the <EXPRESSION> here, they drop out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that this green graph is concave downwards, right? Which means that, and so is the function at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just show you, just to hit the point home.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're evaluating it at <EXPRESSION>, so there's actually going to be a number, right? So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember when we went out far to the left? Starting to approximate the function better around here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that <EXPRESSION> =, let me do it in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's not pick some number that works well with trigonometric functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you can see, I just want to show you that I'm just typing in the actual terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what is this? What's the derivative of this? Well, we could use, this is a constant term, and the derivative of this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the first term was essentially well, you get the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And every term you add to the Taylor polynomial actually makes it so that that term, derivative, of the polynomial evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, = the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the derivative of this polynomial when you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>? Well, when you put <EXPRESSION> into this derivative function, all these other terms are going to drop off, and you're just left with this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's add our third term.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "The slope of the polynomial is also = the slope of the function at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, oh, sorry, this should be a one, right? I said, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case <EXPRESSION>, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next term, we'll have to see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should have some water with it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what does this second term do us? Because we know that if we just evaluated c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? And then, let's do one more term, just for fun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that that's my axes, this is my function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's all the Taylor polynomial is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the second term made sure that at least the first derivative was the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to show you, I just typed it in, right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The further out you go, when you're close to your point that you've picked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already know that, at least at the value of <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's add another term.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So it would be a pretty bad approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could go on like this for infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "these other terms don't matter much, right? Because you're doing <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>, et cetera et cetera.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>, I'm already running out of space, <EXPRESSION>, I think at this point people just write a <EXPRESSION> in parentheses, of the function evaluated at  <EXPRESSION>, and you could just keep adding terms.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "So, what does this thing look like? And what I'm going to do, is I'm going to show you how this polynomial develops as we add terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to approximate <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Obviously, if we get far away, out here, this is a horrible approximation for the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a Taylor polynomial says that if I have a differentiable function <EXPRESSION>, and I want to approximate it with a polynomial at <EXPRESSION>, so at some value of <EQUATION>, I want to approximate this function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"text": "Let me graph it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "And all you'd be left with is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and just keep adding, but then it will take us forever, et cetera, et cetera.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it didn't, ignore this video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in general, you could approximate a function around any value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the third derivative, plus, what's the third derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, so that's plus sign.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> evaluated at <EXPRESSION> what's <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're already starting to approximate this pretty well, right? Now the third derivative of the polynomial = the third derivative of the function at the point <EQUATION>, and we haven't even studied third derivatives.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "So plus <EXPRESSION> evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it gives a something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we could just keep going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have this graphing calculator that I so this thing I got from, just to give them credit, it's my.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we just pick, we approximate the function around <EQUATION> when we did the Maclaurin series.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "I'm pushing 17 minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the function evaluated at <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then we're going to take the fourth derivative, which is the derivative of the third derivative, so the third derivative was <EXPRESSION>, so now we're going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is this is pretty neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this should be pretty neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as you can see, what's neat about this Taylor polynomial is, it's = the function at <EXPRESSION>, its derivative = the function at <EXPRESSION>, the second derivative = the function at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm even going to erase this fourth term.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And we could just keep going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what was the second term? It was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the third term makes sure that the second derivative of our polynomial at <EQUATION> = the second derivative of the polynomial of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "It's closer, at least.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's add some terms.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "The last term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just the first term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I wanted just to show you one thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me graph it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So this is a better approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this function is infinitely differentiable, meaning that I can take the first, second, third, fourth, you know, all the way to infinity derivative of this function, I could construct a polynomial like this, and i can just keep going by adding more and more terms, so that this polynomial's, you know, zeroth derivative, which is means the function, the <EXPRESSION>, first, second, third, fourth, all of this polynomial's derivatives are going to be = the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it only starts to matter as you move really, really far away from your chosen <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's kind of like the concativity of the derivative, or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just with three terms on our polynomial, well, actually, that's the fourth term, officially.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This term would be <EXPRESSION>, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we did the videos on approximating functions with polynomials, we used Maclaurin series, which is actually a special case of the Taylor polynomial or the Taylor Theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could pick some value <EXPRESSION>, some value <EQUATION>, maybe it's right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's getting a little bit better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Graph it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "We're getting a little bit, so it's kind of approximating the curve here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the slope is also = the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is that? Let me just write the definition down, and then we'll do a couple of examples, and then we'll graph it to get the intuition.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 116}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "And the Taylor Theorem tells us that the Taylor polynomial to approximate this is, and then I'll give you the intuition for it in a second.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "Divided by <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It might look like a function, but it's a function evaluated at c, so it's just a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you just added <EXPRESSION> terms, what did we say? The polynomial will be = the function at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were to just to graph the first term of this polynomial, what does it look like? So I'll just type in <EXPRESSION>, and graph it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 131}]}
{"text": "But let me give you the intuition of what this is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as you get further and further away, these terms become more significant, right? As <EXPRESSION> gets further and further away from <EXPRESSION>, and then that's where these start to play in, and you see that in the approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, my brain is really, I ate too many walnuts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The particulars are always the more fun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to approximate <EXPRESSION> around <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "And let's pick some arbitrary number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "com.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our third term, I can see it, it's right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This might have been a little confusing for you, so let's do a particular example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a pretty bad approximation, but at least it = the function at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The big picture is, the whole thinking behind, I guess, what Taylor thought of, was, wow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Obviously, though, when we go further away, it starts to break down again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, if we did 10 terms, or if we did all of the derivatives, these would start to actually = each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope I didn't confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I mean there? Well, what's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> =, well, this is just a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to intersect this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At least around that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "Over <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At least if we stay pretty close to our chosen c, it's a decent approximation for the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of this expression is <EXPRESSION>, and then plus the derivative of this expression, and that's = what? <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All these other terms just drop out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, what was it, <EXPRESSION> And you don't have to worry about all of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's pick around, let's say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "Anyway, let me graph it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "Now this is neat, right? So the first term got us a horizontal line that just intersected the point at cosine of 1, and it was a really bad approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then you could plus the fourth derivative of the function evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just draw a quick and dirty one, and we'll actually draw an accurate one later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little confusing at first, because it gives you this huge formula, and they give you the <EXPRESSION>, and you're like, what is that <EXPRESSION>, and how do I take the derivative? But when you actually try to chug through it, you just have to realize, oh.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it doesn't, you might want to use your calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what's <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bacteria culture initially contains 100 cells.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Bacteria as a function of time is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually since Just to hit another point home, we could have used this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that = I didn't even have to use a calculator, look at that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that tells us Let me [SIDE COMMENTS] Anyway, so what was I doing? Oh.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you would say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there we figured out Using the initial condition here, we figured out I naught.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the same exact logic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's all I'm saying here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is the exact same phenomenon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is also = if we look at it there <EXPRESSION> to the what? <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll say bacteria as a function of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you could say, after an hour the population has increased to, whatever, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just a constant times t, so it's just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, that is a simpler bacterial equation than this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>? So if I raise <EXPRESSION> to that exponent, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where <EXPRESSION> is kind of our compounding rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of both sides of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might want to review all the logarithms if you found that a little confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that makes part B even easier to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think we can erase all of this because we've written down our equation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then they want to know what the rate of growth is after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> of Well, let me do it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're making some progress.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> must = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what are they asking? Find the rate of growth after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hopefully I didn't further confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it says: a bacteria culture initially contains 100 cells and grows at a rate proportional to its size.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if we just knew <EXPRESSION>, then we would have done this part A, find an expression for the number bacteria after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this all is actually a pretty important thing to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually we would probably want to convert backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EQUATION>, right? Because <EXPRESSION> is essentially saying what exponent do I have to raise <EXPRESSION> to to get <EXPRESSION>? So if I raise <EXPRESSION> to that exponent, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then part C.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, to solve this So you're essentially saying log base You would essentially want to take <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you want to solve for <EXPRESSION>, you just divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I'll do more of these problems because they can be a little confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just plugging into your calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how many hours does it take? You just plug this in your calculator and you will get a number for the number of hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know you can't read that, but we'll use it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that tells us that <EXPRESSION>, right? After <EXPRESSION> hour, the population has increased to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is also = If we put <EXPRESSION> here, that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do that actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I got a little bit messier than I wanted to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After an hour, the population has increased to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's figure out the number of bacteria after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could also take <EXPRESSION> and divide it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it just makes things simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we just have to take the derivative of the bacteria function with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it should make a little sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully that makes sense to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you know what you start with, and then you have another point, you can solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be probably <EXPRESSION> something and so we'll do that later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that If you take the natural log of this side, you're just left with the exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then their final question is when will the population reach <EXPRESSION>? So let me see erase what we did with part C.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have an expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have our function now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do that in a special color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't know what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, right? So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the same thing, right? And what would we would have had? We would have had <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you didn't find that too confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the larger you grow, you're going to grow by an absolute value more than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well how can we figure out <EXPRESSION>? Well they give us another data point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's part B.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that the bacteria as a function of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will do This was actually exponential growth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It = what? So what's the derivative of Let's just do the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the derivative at any time t.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divide both sides by <EXPRESSION> and you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To solve for <EXPRESSION>, we take the <EXPRESSION> of both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can actually figure this out analytically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I said that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all of that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The amount of whatever you have as a function of time will be this type of equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now take the <EXPRESSION> of both sides of this equation, right? So then we get what? We get let me draw a divide Well, I'll do it in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's essentially Well what's this going to be? This is the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's a pretty useful thing to know in general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that times Well, e to the As we just did this in part B.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does that leave us? So now we know the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that number we could calculate if you have a calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see what we get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So my question to you is, first of all, what is <EXPRESSION>? What is your initial number of bacterial cells? Well they tell us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION>, right? And so, if we substitute here <EQUATION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's our function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, this is a compound growth problem, or an exponential growth problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I went over this in the exponent proper in the logarithm properties video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then they say find this is part B find the number of bacteria after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me put e to the k on this side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can We'll figure that out later with a calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we could rewrite the derivative as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That at any time <EXPRESSION>, we can tell you how many bacteria there are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Part C, find the rate of growth after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know We knew that, part A, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do you figure out Your calculator has two bases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing as Because this expression right here is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? Actually that's I should have written our original equation as that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then find the expression for the number of So essentially, you'd be trying to figure out the compound interest rate and all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase all this other stuff I have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can erase that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you think about it, what we're going to do here with a bacteria, it's no different than what we did with compound interest when we learned about interest and the number e.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> should just be I naught.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually we could even erase all of this because we've just answered that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could rewrite this as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "e to the ln of Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well part C is actually it was easier to keep it in this form because taking a derivative of <EXPRESSION> is easier than taking a derivative of another base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we got <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have the first thing they want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know <EXPRESSION> and we know <EXPRESSION>, so we know that the equation is So part A, the equation is <EXPRESSION>, bacteria as a function of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After an hour, the population has increased to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so in general, if you have this I naught, the initial amount you have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's part B.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I did is I substituted <EXPRESSION> here and simplified.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of so we can have <EXPRESSION> constant out there times the derivative of this inside function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just plugging into a calculator at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could replace these words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they say when will the population reach <EXPRESSION>? So they're essentially saying when is at what time <EXPRESSION> is <EQUATION>? So we can just say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this first says find an expression for the number of bacteria after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That this right here is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could say Instead of saying bacteria culture, you could say a bank account initially contains $100 and grows at a rate proportional to its size, which would mean compound interest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that'll be an hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>? Well it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do part C.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll do one on exponential decay as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this tells us that the bacteria at time <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has <EXPRESSION> and it has <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in general, anything that When you're dealing with exponential growth or exponential decay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then using this extra data point, we solved for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just a little bit of logarithm math we did here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When will the population reach <EXPRESSION>? Let me write what we have already done a little bit neater.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have two things in an exponent multiplied, that's the same thing as taking that and then raising it to the third power, right? If we were simplifying, we'd say oh that's the same thing as just multiplying that times this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? Because natural log says well, what exponent do I have to raise <EXPRESSION> to to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I took this and I replaced it with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this tells us, after an hour the population has increased to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just want to keep our original equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you think about it well, I'll draw the analogy as we do this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get taking the <EXPRESSION> both sides of this the <EXPRESSION> = Well if you take the <EXPRESSION> to something, you're just left with the something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do you figure out log base of another number of <EXPRESSION>? Well, the simple answer is you could take <EXPRESSION> of this and divide it by the <EXPRESSION> of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They tell us right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find an expression for the number bacteria after <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? Because if you were to simplify, you just take this exponent and multiply this and you'd get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the chain rule tells us it's just the derivative of this whole expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is going to be some bizarre number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or continuously compounding growth or continuously compounding decay, though you'll very seldom hear that term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense, right? Because if <EQUATION>, this whole expression is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could rewrite our original bacterial function equation as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? I just took a this Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's good we left it in that form because it made the derivative all that easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that would be even a better answer for part A.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what are they asking us for? Well they're essentially asking us what is the slope of this function after <EXPRESSION> hours? Or another way you could view it is what is the derivative at <EQUATION>? Let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's pretty straight forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when we substitute here, is that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then we're going to take the definite integral, so let's just say the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's this? At any given point value of <EXPRESSION>, what is kind of going to be the high when we're taking the area, we're taking a bunch of rectangles that are of <EXPRESSION> width, right? So that's that's not dark enough, I don't think that you can see that so that's one of my rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what do we get? What's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is the same thing <EXPRESSION>, and it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that's one of my rectangles right here that I'm going to be summing up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The antiderivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, and we'll have a minus sign out here, so <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, and so this minus minus, those both become pluses, <EXPRESSION> is also <EXPRESSION>, so plus <EXPRESSION>, and so this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> will cancel out, and all we're left with is <EXPRESSION> and that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all of that times the width of each of these little rectangles which is infinitely small <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I were to take the derivative of <EXPRESSION> let's say I took the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the <EXPRESSION> value of the unit circle at <EXPRESSION>, or at <EXPRESSION>? It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well now we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "com, you can actually get I couldn't find the actual multiple choice questions, but you can find the free response questions, and so this question is actually the first free response question that they have on the calculus BC that was administered just recently in 2008.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then these are a little bit more straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It actually took me a whole video just to do that part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I received a suggestion that I do actual old AP exam problems, and I looked on the internet and lo and behold, on the college board site, if you go to collegeboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so the derivative to this is going to be times <EXPRESSION>, or you could say that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is almost this, it just has that <EXPRESSION> there, right? So let's see if we can rewrite this so it looks just like the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, essentially, we're going to take the sum of all of these rectangles, so its height is going to be let me switch colors arbitrarily the height is going to be the top function minus the bottom function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, if I were to take the derivative of it, what do I get? That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's its height? Its height is going to be this top function minus this bottom function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its width is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says, let <EXPRESSION> this is <EXPRESSION> be the region bounded by the graphs of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next video, I'll do part B, and we'll just keep doing this, and I'll try to do a couple of these every day.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the antiderivative of this whole thing? And I'll arbitrarily switch colors again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This should be fairly straightforward for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the bottom graph is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this will be <EXPRESSION> all right, that's that evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> here minus the bottom function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So minus the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> plus the antiderivative of this is <EXPRESSION>, or you could just view that as <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to evaluate that at <EXPRESSION> and at <EXPRESSION>, and let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the antiderivative of this is <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is just a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well anyway, they want so this is the region between these two functions and part A of this and this is kind of the softball question, just to make sure that you know how to do definite integrals and it says, find the area of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this top graph is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll just read it out, because I don't want to write it out all here, but this is the actual diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is part one, part A of number one, on the 2008 DC free response questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these terms don't contribute anything when you evaluate them at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll switch to magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, what functions derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I did, when you evaluate this, <EQUATION>, so I can do this times <EXPRESSION>, and then that's <EXPRESSION>, and then all of that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that? I think you know that we're going to do a little definite integration, so let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to sum them all up from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> remember, I could just carry this over, this is just a constant term this antiderivative is this right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to make sure I have enough space to do this entire problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This should be reasonably familiar to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we do this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how did I know that this was the bottom one? Well I knew that this one was <EXPRESSION>, right? Because sine looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we evaluate this? Well, we essentially take the antiderivative of this and then evaluate that at <EXPRESSION> and then evaluate at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, so that's the antiderivative evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and now let's subtract it evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And frankly, if you understand how to do all of the free response questions, you probably will do fairly well on the multiple choice, because the free response tend to be a little bit more challenging, especially the last parts of the free response.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't look like that, right? When you go <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well anyway, let's do this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take the derivative of the inside, right? By the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since I'm subtracting, I switched both of these signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what are the <EXPRESSION> values? We're going to be going from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I actually copied and pasted this from the PDF that they provide on collegeboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "com.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This curve probably comes back down and intersects over there at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this point right here our polynomial solver told us is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to draw it at an angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So order is <EXPRESSION>, enter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to be the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, let's do Part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just actually downloaded this TI-85 emulator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what they're saying, this is the region r again, just like in the previous two parts of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say we took this cross-section of this solid right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it also intersects at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this is interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For this solid each cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis is a square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they told us that they do not want us to evaluate it, so we are done with Part b.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the order of this polynomial? What's the third-degree polynomial? <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can draw that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK it says, the horizontal line <EQUATION> splits the region <EXPRESSION> this is <EXPRESSION> into two parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember they just want us to write the expression, not evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will continue this problem in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we had a <EXPRESSION> function on the top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I realized that they probably want us to use a graphing calculator to figure out the roots of this polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says right there, a graphing calculator is required for some problems or parts of problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For this solid each cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's small squares and the squares get really big and then they get small again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way I drew it now it looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're going to take all of the sums from <EXPRESSION> = whatever this point is to whatever this point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can kind of imagine what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could just write this and we should hopefully get full credit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the coefficient or the constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this would be a cross-section.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Write, but do not evaluate, an integral expression for the area of the part of <EXPRESSION> that is below the horizontal lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Looks something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the base of a solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not thick enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure out those points? Well what we could do is we can set them = each other, so we could say at what <EXPRESSION> values does <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just to show you the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the coefficient on the <EXPRESSION> term? Well there is no <EXPRESSION> term, right? So that coefficient is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we want to figure out the roots we use the poly function, so second poly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they say the region <EXPRESSION> is the base of a solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's off of this graph, that's not even here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> would look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's keep doing the first problem from the 2008 Calculus BC exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Go down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the height of each of these little rectangles is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that? Well we do the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they care about the area of this part of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Go down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we took the cross-section of the solid here it would be like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure this out? Well the easy part is actually to figure out what the expression we're going to take the definite integral of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, that looks like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can just hit solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I kept trying to guess numbers, or figuring out I even tried to do Newton's method and I kept getting weird numbers, and I became suspicious of myself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We take the area of each of these squares we know they're squares times each of the dx's the small differential and we sum them up over from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the first diagram, I think that was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the height of the rectangles is going to be the difference between the two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At what <EXPRESSION> values are the <EXPRESSION> values the same? So we just set them = each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I looked at the actual test actually I can show it to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what they want us to do is figure out the volume of the solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that the base has to be the same height, has to be the same disk size as the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that curve, I'm going to draw it kind of with a perspective so you can see the solid they're talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's use this to figure out the roots of this polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are three places where <EQUATION> intersects <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the coefficient on the <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we wanted to write this is a proper polynomial expression, we would get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need to figure out this point, this value of <EXPRESSION>, which is going to be here, and then this value of <EXPRESSION>, which is going to be there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's been a long time since I actually took AP Calculus, and now I remember that a graphing calculator was a big deal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the same region <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this curve right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> which is probably right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can use those values that our graphing calculator gave us and put it into our definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the width of each of those rectangles we know from well, just learning calculus or learning integrals the width is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this point right here so this is our limits of integration for our definite integral, right? We're going to sum up these little rectangles from <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Go down again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can draw it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's turn it on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's draw <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They say that it is a square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the volume of the solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what they want to know is an integral expression for the area of the part of <EXPRESSION> that is below the horizontal line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what are the coefficients? Well the coefficient on <EXPRESSION> to the third term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, and I'm about to be out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're on Part b.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's too thick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll put here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is <EQUATION>, and then this function right here is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what they're saying is if it splits this region <EXPRESSION> into two parts, this part and this part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe they'd want you to simplify this a little bit, but I'd be surprised if they were mark off for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the height of each of these rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It intersects at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that'll hopefully save us time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's like we took a knife and we cut like this, we cut parallel to the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I actually just tried to record a video where I was doing this on the fly, and I kept staring at this and I was like, boy, this is a hard polynomial to factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we took the cross-section there, it would be a small square as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we had that polynomial function on the bottom that looks something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> will look something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the expression within the definite integral that we will use? Well, just like we did in Part a, think about we're going to take a sum of a bunch of rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it as a thick line and in a darker color maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They say the region r is the base of a solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it would be a smaller square like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know if you can see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's somewhere off to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Trying to do a little bit of perspective so that we can visualize what they're talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we get three crazy numbers, and this shows you that this would have been very hard to solve analytically if you have a normal brain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so these are really just two of the points where these two functions intersect each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It also intersects at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's going to be a little bit harder to figure out the boundary points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want you see the key strokes so that you, ok turned on, exit out of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to use the calculus function here, so second, calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that gives us the volume for each of these, I guess, parts of the entire solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So each base is going to be <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> right switch the sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which you can do analytically, you but you have to know some power reduction formulas in trigonometry, you have to do some integration by parts, it would probably use up all of the time on the AP Exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the boundaries are pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The area of each of the squares, not just this distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure out the volume of this solid? Which is kind of hard to visualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a couple of minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see how much time I have left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure out the volume of this? Over here, what is the depth? It's going to be <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is kind of, I think, what they wanted you to do, set up the integral, recognize that each of the squares, the area of each of the squares is just going to be this distance, the distance between the functions squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this bottom function, right here, that is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So integrate from <EXPRESSION>, from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the expression, let me move it down a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the area of each of these squares? Each of these cross-sections, what is the area? Well the base is going to be the difference between our two functions, right? This top function right here, that was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we were doing part c of the first problem on the Calculus BC exam, the free response part, and so what, I'll re-read it, it says the region r, this is the region r, is the base of a solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does part d say? The region r models the surface of a small pond, so that's the surface now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the polynomial function below it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we were to sum up all of these infinitely thin solids, we would get the volume for the whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same thing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what it ends up with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So since they said that a graphing calculator is required for some parts of the problem, I say why not use our graphing calculator? Because the graphing calculator is very good at numerically evaluating definite integrals like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, the height will be really high, because this is kind of maybe our maximum point in terms of the base width.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what are our boundaries of integration? Well it's the same thing as in part a.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I wanted to make this a little smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "that's the answer, that is the volume of this solid it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they say, each cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis is a square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the pond essentially gets shallower and shallower as we go to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know that's kind of hard to visualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do part d.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this definite integral function, you have to tell it which is the independent variable, or kind of, you know, what variable are we integrating across, and that's the variable x.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says for this solid, each cross section perpendicular to the x-axis, right? There's two ways you can do a cross-section, you could do them, you could cut this way, but that would be parallel to the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, how do we figure out what the volume of this lake is? But actually, I realize I'm pushing nine minutes, so I will continue this in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we take the cross-section just along the x-axis, the depth is going to look something like this, but then this is the top of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, what we do is, we take the area of each of these squares, and I drew one of them here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm pretty sure they want you to use a calculator, because frankly, computing the integral, that's kind of just chug math, you know, very mechanical math, although it's pretty sophisticated, but it would take you forever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the area? It's going to be this <EXPRESSION>, so we have to square this entire thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at this point, the depth is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the base of the functions, the base of this distance right here is going to be the difference between the top function and the bottom function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we just type in the expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you just tell it the boundaries of integration, and we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I redrew the region r here, but with a little perspective, so we can hopefully visualize it in three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could almost imagine it, let me see if I can draw it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> So you could write that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So essentially <EXPRESSION> is the depth, right? So at this point of this pond, the depth is just <EXPRESSION>, right <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At all points <EXPRESSION> at a distance <EXPRESSION> from the y-axis, the depth of the water is given by <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Press F5, definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we essentially just have to evaluate this now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the area of each of these squares, and then we have to multiply them times a little bit of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, this would be the base, and since we know the cross-section is the square, the height has to be the same length as the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so here, the depth of the pond is given by the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this function right here, this is definite integral, a very useful function to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you integrate that from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take you each of the area of each of these squares, multiply them by a super small change in <EXPRESSION>, and that we know, from everything we've learned in calculus hopefully, that that super small change in <EXPRESSION>, I'm trying to draw a little perspective, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is, it's probably drawn in, that's the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get out my TI-85 emulator again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The region r models, let me, paste, oh, I didn't want to do that, edit, undo, edit, paste, there you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's in some ways you easier to visualize it than it is to draw, so you have to give me some credit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's open parentheses sin of where is pi? Pi is I haven't used one of these calculators in a long, long time oh there it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far this might look pretty similar to part a, but what's the twist here? We want the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Second <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's still pretty wide, then it gets narrow again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the sin function with some perspective.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we multiply <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, that is the volume of this kind of part the entire solid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We wanted to cut perpendicular to the x-axis, or parallel to the y-axis, right? So if we cut it along the line like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that? Well let's write our integral expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I drew a couple of squares here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So over here, the depth is <EXPRESSION>, so if I were to draw, so if I were to go straight down the depth is, you know maybe it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I haven't made a mistake, I can hit enter, and let the calculator do the rest of the work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here the depth is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So essentially the pond is going to get shallower and shallower or as we go further to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just like in part b, I've first tried to evaluate this analytically, and you end up getting a very, very, very hairy integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we were to take a cross section, so let's say that this, let's take this cross section of the pond.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the volume this time, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so to find the volume, we think about it the same way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do second insert.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the height along the surface of the pond is going to be the difference between the two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not too different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will, every day, try to do a couple of these problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's integrate from <EQUATION> from <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Second enter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could do second enter, and we'll get the previous entry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At all points in <EXPRESSION> at a distance <EXPRESSION> from the y-axis, the depth of the water is given by <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not squaring it anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it noticed, it is calculating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know this the height, sorry, the width along the surface of this cross section is going to be the difference between this function and this function, right? So if I were to draw, let me see if I can, so this is that same cross section, it's the width along the top, I know I'm confusing you, is going to be this function minus this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was part c that we already have in our calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we go here, we can delete this squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does a cross section at any point of the pond look like? Well if we, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's going to be the height, right here? Well, they told us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again, this is a really hard integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the volume of the water in the pond.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want the volume for the entire pond, we take essentially the volume of each of these kind of slivers of the pond.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only difference between what we did in Part C and now is, now, instead of having in Part C, we had this expression squared.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, I think, is a fair answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's do, I want you to see my key strokes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the area of each cross section.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EQUATION>, the pond is exactly <EXPRESSION>, I guess, you know, we could say feet, or whatever the units are, deep, and then when <EQUATION>, the pond is <EXPRESSION> unit deep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION>, right, that's the same thing as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we already typed in a bunch of stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And our variable of integration is <EXPRESSION>, and we're integrating from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's hit enter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's use the calculator to evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Deleted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's insert times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we take the area of each cross section, and we multiply it by a very small width to get a very small sliver.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we thought about, this is, you know, a perspective drawing of this, this is the surface of the pond, right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says, the region <EXPRESSION> models the surface of a small pond.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we don't have it squared, but we're multiplying it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're doing the last part of Problem 1 of the 2008 Calculus BC exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we take that and multiply it by <EXPRESSION>, and we integrate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to draw, let me see if I can draw this cross section.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know that the top function is <EXPRESSION>, and we know that this bottom function is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area of this cross section of the pond is going to be <EXPRESSION> times the depth of the pond, right? That's the surface width times the depth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in a different color, I know it can be kind of confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And our answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We sum up all of these slivers of the pond from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The height of the pond, or the depth of the pond, at any point, is <EXPRESSION>, whatever <EXPRESSION> value we're at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I was trying to draw the depth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll repeat the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or it's something that you can do, especially if you use integration by parts, but it's a little bit messy, and you only have <EXPRESSION> minutes to do all three problems on the BC exam, so I'm assuming that they want you to use the calculator here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says concert tickets went on sale at noon, <EQUATION>, and were sold out within <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since it's twice differentiable, we also know that its derivative is continuous because the second derivative exists at all points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could say at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everyone has gotten their tickets, or maybe they got sold out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will continue part b in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They give us that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's keep going forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because there's a positive slope here and then it immediately switches to a negative slope like the absolute value functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they tell us it's twice differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we divide it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's going to be right about there, just approximating it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's about right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we really just have to do the first <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's keep going with our 2008 Calculus BC free answer questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the best estimate I can do, of the rate at which this <EXPRESSION> is changing at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is noon, 12:00 noon, 1:00 pm, 9:00 pm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just approximating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can grow that a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So doesn't hurt to just copy and paste.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Indicate the units of measure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you could write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The number of people waiting in line to purchase tickets at time <EXPRESSION>, is modeled by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this might seem kind of daunting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You actually wouldn't be able to take the derivative at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well it's good to do it neatly when you're doing the exam, because otherwise you'll confuse yourself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, we have <EXPRESSION> people in line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's about right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they don't give us a continuous function definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION> there are <EXPRESSION> people in line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's just going to be the slope between these two points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That should be good enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, we have <EXPRESSION> people in line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's plot the points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the number of people waiting in line at anytime.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the real <EXPRESSION>, whatever we used to approximate it, it's not going to have these sharp edges because it's differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>, the line is gone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is my <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION> we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, if this was <EXPRESSION> less, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the denominator? It's hours, people per hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They just give us a bunch of sample points of this function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could say approximately =, or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't have do it so neatly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm about to graph it because I want you to understand how to do this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says part a let me make sure I'm not writing too thickly use the data in the table to estimate the rate let me actually just copy and paste this, I've just figured out how to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to take up all the space though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want to do this really fast, you wouldn't have to graph it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I cut and pasted the table that they gave for the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do they want to know? They want to know an estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first <EXPRESSION> hours, that's right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They give us 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK so we've at least plotted the sample points and connected them with lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that whatever function we're modeling this, this <EXPRESSION>, that it's continuous because it's differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway back to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's right about there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There to there, almost done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll read the rest of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I just realized.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Indicate units of measure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can write it however you want, however you think that the exam graders would best like to see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There to there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see what we can do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little bit more than at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let's graph all of them, just because it might be useful in future parts of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Connect the dots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could write average rate of change or <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's graph some of these points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it says use the data in the table to estimate the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 5:30 pm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now for some reason it's been limiting me again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So halfway up would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So my best estimate, or our best estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 5:30 pm, which is between these two points, is the average slope between these two points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's about right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this was the actual function, you wouldn't be able to take a derivative at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me clear all of this so we have enough space for part b.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see, how high should my <EXPRESSION> values? This is time right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they want us to use the units of measure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The trapezoidal sum for the fourth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's actually going to be a smoother curve, right? Because we can take the derivative of any point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION> people per hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So from here to there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's connect those points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No that doesn't look good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK part b says, use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know what that sound was from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that = <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you understand it, you don't have to graph it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I can make this a little bit bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Rise over run or change in the value of the function divided by change in the independent variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Show the computations that lead to your answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <EXPRESSION> hours that the tickets were on sale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You probably can't read it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's write it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the numerator, this is people.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is in between these two is to just figure out the average rate of change between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could say that the average rate of change is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll copy and don't know if you can read it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they don't give us any data on 5:30 pm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I figure it doesn't hurt.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION> they skip <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION> it's <EXPRESSION> people in line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure that out? Well the average rate of change is just the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually twice differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do part b.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK well I'll read it out loud in case you can't see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're on problem number 2.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you weren't graphing it while recording a video, it probably would be a little bit faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes up to about, <EXPRESSION> is a high point, at least on the data we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For some reason, YouTube used to let me do longer videos because I thought I was a partner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And from there to there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What are our data points? We have <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the tickets are sold by 9:00 pm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can let's see, I can erase all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the average of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>? Well, the average of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, use trapezoidal sum with <EXPRESSION> subintervals to estimate the average number of people that sounds very complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there had to be a sign change, and so it had to pass through <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "or from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So from here to here, we have a sign change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the area of this first trapezoid? Well, what do you do to find an area of a trapezoid? It's the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Use yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's another way to view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not doing velocity in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Enter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, <EXPRESSION>, not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I would write down at the AP exam, is, I was like, well, the function is twice differentiable, which means its derivative is continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just want to make it as neat as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll have the average value of over the first <EXPRESSION> hours of the people in line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my reason and actually, you could use Rolle's Theorem or the mean value theorem, but the simplest reason is that here we have <EXPRESSION> sign changes in the average velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Trusty TI-85 emulator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or corollary to the fundamental theorem of calculus, whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> or it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're doing part b and part of problem number two.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, that's the derivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this area right here is <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's good enough, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's my answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at some point, since the derivative is continuous it doesn't jump around it had to be positive someplace in this range.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's an easier one, right? <EXPRESSION> is right in between those two, and we don't have to do much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the average value? Well, it's going to be the average value between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think this graph is going to come in useful in part c, by just glancing at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you know, the way I drew it, it looks like the slope is <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can erase this, I can erase that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Its base is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which tells us the derivative is continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So from here let me use a thicker line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will continue part d in the next video, because I'm already over 10 minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me copy and paste it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or the average, not the average velocity, the rate the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then it comes up like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can draw that a little bit I drew them in different colors, just so you can see the trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this trapezoid goes goes from oh, I don't know if I'm doing this right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is one subinterval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the total area under those trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you really just have to think about what they're saying, and it's not that daunting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The base is <EXPRESSION>, right? From noon to 4:00 p.m.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this one, we have this one, and we have this trapezoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or in that case, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know, a curve and then it maxes out at some point, comes down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then they ask us, well, what's the average value of the function? Well, the average value is just the area divided by the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's going to use this graph, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me erase at least this top part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the area of this trapezoid right here? This bigger one? Well, its base is <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then another trapezoid there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the total area? It's just going to be the sum of these <EXPRESSION> trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to erase all the unnecessary things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll be a curve, right? Anyway, they say, what is the fewest number of times that <EXPRESSION> must be = <EXPRESSION>? Well, what happens when <EQUATION>? That means that we are at a local minima or a local maxima, or sometimes an inflection point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right here it's <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And between here and here, it looks like the slope is also going to have to bottom out at some point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll use a line tool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be very confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? Because another way to think about it, if you just took the average value of the function so if the function was, say, this, and you just multiplied that average value times the base, you would get the same area as the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says a trapezoidal sum with <EXPRESSION> subintervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this area of the trapezoid right here, this first one, is the base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Divided by <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But at minima and maxima point, we know for sure that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say <EXPRESSION> = essentially let's say, between <EXPRESSION> points, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> it's the difference between the <EXPRESSION> points divided by the area under the curve of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From here to here, we have a sign change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is another subinterval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the area of that trapezoid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just apply that here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? Between here and here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So 1 trapezoid here, and another trapezoid there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually twice differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let's do part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? The average value of a function = the area under the curve divided by, you could kind of say, the base of the figure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we can just eyeball it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, copied it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>, is less than <EXPRESSION>, right? What is the fewest number of times at which <EXPRESSION> must be = <EXPRESSION>? Give a reason for your answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And finally, what's the average value of this trap or what's the area in this trapezoid? Well, the base is <EXPRESSION>, right? It's going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 156}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 160, "end_offset": 172}]}
{"text": "They don't tell us to round it or anything, so I'm assuming that's, you know, if we're saying the average number of people, I guess we can have a fraction there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So it's the average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have three trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I see, there's <EXPRESSION> very natural subintervals here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it says, <EXPRESSION> intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're actually not going to use an interval.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The top part I can erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it, maybe it maxes out, and it comes down like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we just divide this value by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, it might look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I just took the data they gave, graphed it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the sum of those <EXPRESSION> trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It had to be negative someplace in this range.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write down the important points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might not remember it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that same argument could be used between here and here, and here and here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like boy, I don't that sounds yeah, you know, I didn't learn trapezoidal sums, or however you want to think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's reasonable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's use the trapezoidal sum to figure out the area under this curve, or an estimate of the area under <EXPRESSION>, and then we can divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, what part are we? We're on part c.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The base times the average value is the same thing as the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the real graph of this is going to look something you know, let me do it in a bold color like magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have <EXPRESSION> sign changes in the derivative, right? The derivative is positive over this interval, or at least its average is positive, then it goes negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we don't know that for sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's really a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could look at this graph and we could say, well, you know, there has to be a minima point someplace in this range.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or the average value between this height and this height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's another way to view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to use a trapezoidal sum to estimate the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I just divide it by <EXPRESSION>, and I'm done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it says, use a trapezoidal sum with <EXPRESSION> subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <EXPRESSION> hours.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we essentially just have to figure out the area of each of these trapezoids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Edit, paste.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Part b.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just need to figure out the areas of each of these trapezoids, and that's my estimate of the area under the curve of <EXPRESSION>, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Give us a reason.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the average value of a function? And you learned this in calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I just eyeball it, I say, well, I have <EXPRESSION> maximum points, and one minima point, so the slope is going to = <EXPRESSION> at at least <EXPRESSION> points, right? But they tell us, give us a reason for your answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me I'll draw the dotted lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did that in the last video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer to part b is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's a maximum point right someplace in this range, and it's going to max out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they say, use a trapezoidal sum with <EXPRESSION> subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <EXPRESSION> hours that the tickets were on sale.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I connected these dots, I just kind of wanted to get a shape of the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can be more formal when you write it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And frankly, I haven't taken calculus in <EXPRESSION> years.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So derivative is continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not like this sharp edged line, right? And how do we know it's a curve? Because it's differentiable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is <EXPRESSION>? Let me use a calculator, just so I don't make any mistakes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me draw them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? That's, I think they call that the second fundamental theorem of calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And from here to here, we could have a sign change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would have taken you quite a while if you had to actually do the integral yourself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if we want to know how many tickets were sold at <EQUATION>, that's just = the definite integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, or we could also view it as the area under this curve, from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "So that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My independent variable is <EXPRESSION>, I've just swapped <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> there, and I'm taking the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 58}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 123}]}
{"text": "That only took us four minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's copy and pasted.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "I will see you in problem number three.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, and they want us to round to the nearest whole number.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "So this is the derivative of the total tickets sold function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or another way that we could write it is the total tickets sold so let's call that, I don't know, capital T sub well let me I don't want to do <EXPRESSION>, that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE] So let's say the tickets sold as a function of time is going to be = the definite integral well, we could say is at any time <EXPRESSION>, the tickets sold and this is the fundamental theorems calculus, I think it might be one of its correlaries or actually sometimes it is the fundamental theorem of calculus, I always forget my definitions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this integral right here, you can solve it analytically using integration of parts, which I just called the reverse product rule, but you only have <EXPRESSION> minutes to do all three of these problems, and they'll let you use your graphing calculator, and your graphic calculator is excellent at doing definite integrals, and they just want the number, right? So let's use our graphic calculators to get that number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the rate at which tickets are sold.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Between <EQUATION> and <EXPRESSION> or if we want to know the tickets sold, between <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Based on the model, how many tickets were sold by 3:00 PM? So my <EQUATION> to the nearest whole number? So that's sometimes important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the nearest whole number is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to copy, so how do we do that? We just do second the division button but that's calc definite, let me use the definite integral, and like what was, let's see, let me make sure I have that <EXPRESSION> let's just use <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You don't want to give a decimal answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're ready to do part D, and let me copy and paste that in as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> per hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, I don't think that's going to need this graph, so let me just remove that with a color other than yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate at which tickets were sold for t for over this range is modeled by <EXPRESSION> let me write that in case you can't see it is the rate at which tickets were sold.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it would have taken us even less if we didn't have to explain it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we say <EXPRESSION> tickets sold by 3:00 PM.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Click enter, let the calculator do the work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's the whole function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know if you can read it, but it's helpful for me to review the problem on our clipboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It = all we do is we take this expression we take the derivative of <EXPRESSION> and we just assume that <EXPRESSION> is some constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "I know it sounds fancy, but you'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way to write this exact same thing is if we wrote that <EQUATION> we could have written as this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, just what does a function look like in three dimensions? And actually we'll go over the different types.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what does that mean? Well, that means if I were and actually, let me give you a little notation, before I show you what that means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the most intuitive, to me at least, is a surface in three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can visualize that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, we're taking an implicit derivative here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's figure out how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> =, I don't know, when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see this is the x-axis, the y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we had our traditional x and y-axis before, but now let's give another dimension of height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you said, what is the slope of the tangent line? Any point on this graph actually has an infinite number of tangent lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll give you the link for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The height is the z-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Go back to the pen tool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all that means is that if I give you an x-value and a y-value you get a z-value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just the convention, you know, for drawing the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I thought it's nice to see that notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The equation of that surface and let me just clear out everything, just because we'll probably need the extra space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the slope of this function with respect to <EXPRESSION> at the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is called the partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're going to learn is when you take a derivative in three dimensions, you have to specify the direction that you're taking the derivative in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's now expand our knowledge of calculus to the third dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll take that risk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll use a different color for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we go and then we say, well, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is just a convention, that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we had to plot that point of the surface and maybe I'll actually graph this one in a little bit we go along the x-axis <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, <EXPRESSION> is just a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we would plot that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to hold everything else constant and take the derivative with respect to just one variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you have some constant times <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of that is just the constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have your palm of your thumb, and then your thumb is going to open up in this direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So every time <EXPRESSION> increases <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> will increase by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we said if we want to take a derivative, it's hard to you know, you can't just say there is one derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the rate at which the height, or the rate at which <EXPRESSION> is changing with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you take this point this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we want the slope at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, what is the equation of this surface? And I just picked one that they had on Wikipedia.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do we make increasing <EXPRESSION> pointing out this way? Or do we make increasing <EXPRESSION> point inwards? And this gives us the convention.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that wall represents the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll start taking the partial derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are different types of representations we'll see, when we start working with three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just bear with me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just the notation, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I mean by that? This is <EXPRESSION> those colors really don't go well together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And make that toothpick tangent to the bowl, and you can see that on any point on the bowl, you can just rotate that toothpick around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the y-axis, and that's the z-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually no harder than taking a regular derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I mean by the cross product? So if this is the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say, what's <EXPRESSION> of, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, comma <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just a good to know, where did that convention come from? This is kind of called a right-handed coordinate system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to pick a direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, at the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then it becomes very hard to visualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that cap just means it's a unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could have a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we plot the points on the surface? And I'll show you, actually, computer generated surfaces that are far more professional looking than anything I could possibly try to draw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can view it as a <EXPRESSION> with the top curled.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the slope is a little bit less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We go along the y-axis <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we define a surface in three dimensions? Well, we can define <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the unit vector for there is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of just the number with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Look at that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you would see, if you kept doing that, you would plot a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I think you'd understand, where you pick an x-point, you pick a y-point, and then z this surface right here, without this line intersecting it this surface right here, is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is in the y-direction, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, we're assuming <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't worry about this wall.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a number, right? <EXPRESSION> is just a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the equation of that surface is and I'm going to remove this now, so I don't sound like I'm melting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that would mean <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw the cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is why I actually drew this wall here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Your thumb is going to point up, which is the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me clean this up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the convention is to kind of follow the right hand rule, where the x-axis taking the cross product of the x-axis with the y-axis = the z-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to slow things too down while I'm trying to do my screen capture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can kind of view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we could use this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this is a length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll get to this in a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, I don't know, let's pick one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's actually free.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, little cap.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what does this mean? Well, what is the slope of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> at, say, when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and actually, let's pick smaller numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you see that, right? The tangent right here is increasing with increasing values of <EXPRESSION>, but a little bit less than <EXPRESSION> degrees.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> and still a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, right? It still depends on what constant <EXPRESSION> you're using = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take a bowl or something that maybe you know, like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then take a, I don't know, a toothpick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you take the first vector, put your index finger in the direction of the first vector, middle finger in the direction of the second vector, and your other fingers can do what they need to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we just say, for any constant <EXPRESSION>, how much does <EXPRESSION> change with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Then we take the partial derivative this is the notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is going in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this surface right here, this is I'll actually show you the graph of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, of j, right? In the y-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I'm all out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to make sure you remember which variable is a variable, and which one is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's in y-direction, but it has a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So i goes in this direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you can have a line in three dimensions, or kind of a curve in three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to make sure I can do my hand properly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here is a surface I use, using this Java applet grapher.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Along this wall, y is a constant, right? So if we assume that <EXPRESSION> is constant, then maybe we could take just the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm afraid that when I manipulate this graph, it'll slow down my computer and I'll start sounding like I'm melting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And eventually, we can expand this into n dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that this is my x-axis and I'll draw the positive quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the natural question that you might want to ask and actually, let me show you a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This'll probably really slow down my computer, but you can actually rotate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, think of it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can have a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we would essentially take the slope of this curve right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because if you look at this surface, if you were to pick any arbitrary point on this surface, and say, what is the slope of that surface? Well, it kind of has no meaning, because you have to kind of pick a direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd plot a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can go up here, I don't know, we'd go up <EXPRESSION> units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you kind of have to pick the orientation of that toothpick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's get to the meat and potatoes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to slow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, well, how do we apply calculus to surfaces? Because actually, let me bring that thing out again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say we wanted to hold <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think the most intuitive and none of these are directly intuitive I think you have to really be able to visualize them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This wall is the equation <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I did, I picked the point <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it in magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually I'm going to add more variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we just take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, this is just a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to keep in mind what's constant and what's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So If we wanted to expand it all out, the partial of f with respect to <EXPRESSION>, this is the function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Ah, sorry, what's the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well now, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are just constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, not reverse it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this box is kind of the domain, and the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> dimensions that I define.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that <EXPRESSION>, and I'm confining it to three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could say that it's going to be cosine of <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How much does <EXPRESSION> change in the <EXPRESSION> direction if we hold <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although we can do it more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> squared is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's also = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can just write that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that, I don't know, just so you get used to the different notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> kind of do the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we would take the derivative of the x's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the point <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to pick the direction that you want to go in the xy plane, and then you could plot a tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you hold <EXPRESSION> constant, here's a tangent line at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just a little bit of algebraic manipulation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I just want to rearrange it, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or we could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do some that might confuse you, so you see how to do them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative in that direction is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do that in yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this, what I did, so this vertical line, I just wanted to show you that when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> we treat as a constant now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, because when you take the derivative the constant just comes out of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it'll just be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> at that point? Or we could write, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me erase this, because I picked a different point where I graph, and I graphed it ahead of time just to save time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a does have only one tangent plane, but within a tangent plane, there are an infinite number of tangent lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Delete that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It =, we figured that, let's see <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of a constant with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so ignore it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction at that point is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way we're doing it now is, <EXPRESSION> is a variable, <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Kind of, I bounded it because it starts to increase really fast, and you wouldn't be able to see all this interesting stuff that happens closer in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can actually take, we can actually zoom in on this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see it's quite symmetric.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This shows that the partial of the function with respect to <EXPRESSION>, the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the part that's interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, now we're saying how much does <EXPRESSION> change with respect <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the hardest part about doing these partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the derivative of the second expression, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can actually rotate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of the first term with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we treat <EXPRESSION> like a constant So cosine of a constant, this is just going to be a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not too difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, maybe I'll do it more dimensions now that we're not going to try to visualize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we just take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well anyway, that's the fun with graphing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then finally, the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, this is pretty cool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could kind of view it as, if you hold y constant, here's a tangent line at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> times, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is, this surface once again is the surface of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times the second expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It = <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, plus, let's put this <EXPRESSION> out front, just so we change the order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, those are both constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION> =? Let's see, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Zoom it a little bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I don't think I have to include this anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can rotate it just to get more intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is still going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can visualize this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what is the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well everything else is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And like I said in the last video, you can actually have infinite tangent lines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> could just be, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to zoom in on the part that is interesting, let me translate this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then these two lines, this is, if you think about it, this is the line where <EXPRESSION> is constant, right? So this is the slope in the <EXPRESSION>, or as the surface changes with respect to <EXPRESSION> at this point, right? This is the tangent line relative to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before we move on to other functions, let's also take the partial derivative of our function here, <EXPRESSION>, or the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you're so used to taking the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, I'm just doing the product rule here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's reverse it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to realize that anything with the <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can almost ignore that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could say, <EXPRESSION>, it's just a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this line shows that the partial of the slope, or the partial the function, sorry the partial of <EXPRESSION>, or the partial of the function with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can actually get rid of my parentheses there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can just write that out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because this equation is pretty symmetric.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that just kind of helps show you that, ok, that shows what point we're working with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this actually becomes pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, two lines define a plane, and the plane that's defined by those two lines, or any of the two tangent lines to that point, defines a tangent plane to the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you see that both of those lines are tangent at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know it's hard for you to get used to saying that, oh, <EXPRESSION>, that's just a constant number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, still a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we take the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> at that same point, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's why we did partial derivatives to begin with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of the second expression, times the first expression, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the partial now in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the derivative of, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not too difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let me rotate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This whole <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, if <EXPRESSION> is some number, <EXPRESSION>, this is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's just chug through a bunch of partial derivative problems just so that you get used to the mathematics of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just want to put the minus out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's, the graphing thing looks a little bit funny sometimes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, right? Just substitute <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could put that out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we picked the point <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me bring in my graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are just points that the software has picked to actually display these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The magnitude of this vector is what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That might be useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See if I can show that to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you look at it, this is the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that none of these vectors have any dimensions in the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to scale it anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because even though we're applying it to a three-dimensional surface, but then you can do the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way to think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does that look like? Well what are each of the components of this vector? What is <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction? What does that vector look like? What is <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction look like? And this I have graphed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This parallel to this line is the vector in the x-axis, right? So at this point I've actually calculated the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the direction is just the i unit vector, or in the direction of increasing <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's more clear if we look from below the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me zoom out a little bit because I want you to see the actual axes There's the axes So all this says if I were to go in this direction, I get the maximum slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And obviously if there's a function of more variables you could keep going and you'd multiply the magnitude of the derivative in each of those dimension's directions times the unit vector in that dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can rotate this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I would have traveled this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, then I will get the maximum increase in <EXPRESSION> per unit that I travel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we saw there was some symmetry, so the magnitude of this vector is the same as the magnitude of this vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gradient of our particular function, it's a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's direction, it just goes in the <EXPRESSION> direction, because it's that times the <EXPRESSION> unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want you to think about it a little bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this is the y direction, or the same direction as the <EXPRESSION> unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I need to travel a little bit more in the <EXPRESSION> direction, and I'll get the maximum change in <EXPRESSION> if I travel there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we multiply that in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll see what I mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I go in that direction I get a maximum upward slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can extend this to any dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you could extend it to <EXPRESSION> dimensions, but it becomes very hard to visualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gradient that we use this vector differential operator this upside down triangle the gradient of <EQUATION> which is the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction so it gives the magnitude of the slope and the <EXPRESSION> direction, and then it points the vector in that direction plus the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we figure that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why is that interesting? Well the gradient and this is the intuition the gradient tells you the direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane you should travel in order to get the maximum slope in the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same surface we've been working with, but now I've plotted these points right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The plane defined by all of these vectors is all flat in the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you add them together, you get the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's actually show you what it looks like in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we multiply that in the <EXPRESSION> direction, or in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I'm here notice here the <EXPRESSION> component of the gradient is much larger than the <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is more of a bowl as opposed to a hill, but anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to take the gradient in two-dimensional space, and you'll see what that means in a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I just go head on so I'm above the graph looking straight down at the graph, and then the colors just show kind of you know where we are if I travel in this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, I get my maximum increase in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what does this mean? And another way to view it, you could have also written this as the gradient of <EQUATION> and then all of that in the i direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not times, operated on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Zoom in, there you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I go in this direction, my <EXPRESSION> goes up like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I wanted to see the axes, which you can't see now that I'm zoomed in, but you took my word this was the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can actually zoom in a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the gradient says, well, if I travel in this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane notice that none of these have any <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's pretty neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, this vector right here I hope you can see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in my opinion at least the intuition is a little bit harder to get your head around than the actual mechanics, but once you get it, it makes a lot of sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the partial with respect to y, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's actually calculate the gradient of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you were to take any closed line where the <EXPRESSION> is constant well actually I don't want to get into that too much, but this gradient will actually be normal to any, or it'll be perpendicular to any curve where <EXPRESSION> is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the magnitude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually it becomes hard to visualize beyond what we're doing right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does this mean? Well before I go into what it means, let's actually calculate it for this and then I'll show you what it means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this vector is the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you add the two vectors together, you get this vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if you wanted to do it into three space that's not going to apply to our problem because we only care about two dimensions right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> said what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, and then that doesn't matter anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They say that = the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can rotate this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll do a few more problems where we just calculate gradients, just because I think it's useful to get the mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're all kind of giving you directions in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just rotate it around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just different notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The j unit vector goes in the same direction as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do the rotated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's learn a little bit about the gradient, and we'll use the same function we've been using since we're pretty familiar with it's graph and it's partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're going to take the gradient of this, and then I'll give you a little bit of intuition on what a gradient is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the gradient tells you, how do you get the maximum upward slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I can spin it around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And because of this notation, a lot of people view this delta operator and actually it's pretty consistent when we learn about the divergence and the curl a lot of people view this delta operator, they actually define it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you could take the partial derivative with respect to any direction, and the gradient gives you the direction in which the slope is the largest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I go in that direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, I get maximum <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> said what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we calculated this in the two videos on the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the partial of this function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you go to this point right here, this is the magnitude of this vector, shows what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I'm on a hill, the gradient of that surface will tell you at any point what direction you need to travel in to go up the hill fastest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we just calculated the partial derivative at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully that makes some sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to get too involved with that right now, so let's go back here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This vector says, what is the magnitude of this vector is the partial derivative of the function, or the partial derivative of the surface, or the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or the direction which the steepness of the hill is maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can pull it down a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It gave this length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or another way to view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the magnitude is determined by the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say the temperature in a room is a function of where I am in the room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gradient of <EXPRESSION> = now you might be daunted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you can kind of view it as almost a three-dimensional slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All a scalar field means is that in any point in this base and in this case we're dealing with three-dimensional space at any point in that space we can associate a value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Associated with every coordinate is just a temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually the gradient of the function that we just solved for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's write our temperature function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of that with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just going to be these are just constants, so the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would just get a temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how would we view the gradient of this function? Well the gradient of this function is going to tell us in which direction and actually, the gradient of this function is going to generate a vector field, because it's going to tell us in which direction do we have the largest increase in temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say it's a function of my <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of the outside expression, the way I imagine it, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's a scalar field? One that I find fairly intuitive is temperature in a three-dimensional room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's not what we're learning here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you wanted to know the gradient at any point in space, you would substitute an <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me make it bigger so we can explore it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the radius away from the center, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the radial distance away? And this actually isn't that relevant to learning gradients, but let's get a little intuition about what that actual temperature function how it actually changes as you go through the room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase this thing down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we have a <EXPRESSION> kelvin heat force in the center of our room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that the temperature function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then all of that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's try to get our heads around what the gradient of a function of three variables looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's actually fly in to the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then all of that times the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The harder part is the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you get closer and closer to our heat source, the rate at which the temperature increases, increases! Right? The vectors as you get closer, get bigger and bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION>, the temperature at any point, was a scalar field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the last video we had a three-dimensional surface, where the height <EXPRESSION> was a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I first learned gradients, I think the computation is relatively straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to switch from this blue color, because it's a little nauseating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the derivative of the whole thing is just itself again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where the magnitude are the partial derivatives, and then the direction is given by <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, I have an e to this three variable function, how do I take the partial derivative? Remember, if you're taking the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> you just pretend like the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> are constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You wouldn't get a temperature and a direction, so it's not a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative of this inner function with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the intuition is always the interesting thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Kind of radially further and further away from that source.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also, the magnitude of those vectors in that vector field will tell us how large of an increase in temperature we are looking at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we just plug and chug and figure out the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that center of the room is at the coordinates <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And hopefully this temperature analogy and not even analogy this temperature model will make a little sense to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, the more important thing is I always find with gradients it's easy to calculate them, but the intuition oh sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me zoom in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're now within the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could write it as the gradient function is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it applies to pretty much any scalar field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why <EXPRESSION> is such an amazing number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope that doesn't confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At any point in three dimensions it just gave you a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I'm not going to go into that, because I realize I'm running out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the direction is given by the relative weighting of the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So plus what's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's going to look very similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you add them together like you would add any vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now when you have the gradient, at any point in three dimensions it gives you a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is also included.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the easiest one for me to imagine is a scalar field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it'd be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? And now we can do the same thing for the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I'm just saying that it exponentially decays as you get further and further away from that source.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of <EXPRESSION>, I wrote <EXPRESSION>, just to kind of give you the intuition that this expression is just saying the square of the distance as we get away from the center of our room, or from the coordinate <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you can simplify this algebraically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't know, I have never actually modeled temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it gave us surface in three-dimensional space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get an intuition of what this gradient function will actually look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's pretty good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's write temperature as a function of <EQUATION> which is exactly what I wrote up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then finally, the partial derivative of the temperature function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say our temperature function I'm just making this up, I don't know if this is an accurate model of temperature it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's why it's called a scalar field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can imagine as you go further and further away from that heat source it's going to get colder and colder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take the derivative of the inside function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've gone from having a scalar field to a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's compute the gradient, and then I'll show you a diagram that might make things a little bit more intuitive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now why did I say r? I said it's a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's say I have, I don't know, a <EXPRESSION> kelvin actually, let me make it so that our vector field works out right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you can see, at any point and when this graphing program that did it, it just picked different points and it calculated the gradients at that point, and then it graphed them as vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then all of that times the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the way I view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can see as we get closer and closer to the center of our heat source, the vectors, the rate at which the temperature increases, gets bigger and bigger and bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? Because it has <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a <EXPRESSION> right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the length of the vectors are just the magnitudes of the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want you to understand, at least conceptualize this, it's hard to draw a scalar field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gradient of <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could distribute this minus if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we could simplify this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you were to take a thermometer and measure any point in space in the room that you're in right now, you would get a temperature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write it up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> here, this is just a constant that when you take the derivative of a constant times something the constant carries over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the gradient of the temperature function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm treating the other two variables that I'm not taking the partial derivative with respect to, as constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you can see, the intuition is pretty interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But a common mnemonic to remember the operation of diverge and is to write the upside down triangle, which was the same notation we used for gradient, but take the dot product of that and the vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I have a particle here, it's velocity in the x-direction is going to be <EXPRESSION> to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you take the divergence of something, you're going in the opposite direction, in some ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when <EQUATION> I could have picked any points, but I'm just picking the numbers that's easy to calculate when <EQUATION>, what is the magnitude of the vector? It's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or we can even, let's do it in two dimensions, but I'll make it constant in the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then its velocity in the y-direction, I don't know maybe it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You start with the vector field, right? And what's a factor field? It's something that if you give me any point <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, I'll give you a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if we went to three dimensions, the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and the k-direction, et cetera, et cetera.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? If <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, <EXPRESSION> is just a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, oh, I didn't want to do that dot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for any <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of the vector doesn't change, right? It's only dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be twice as big.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So its velocity in the x-direction is actually a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in one dimension.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say this vector field, just for the purposes of visualization it could be anything, but let's say it represents the velocity of particles of fluid of any point in two dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, if I have a particle right here in my fluid, if this is a particle, its velocity in the x-direction is going to be 1 meter per second to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that is the divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at any point in the x-direction, at any point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>, its velocity in the x-direction will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the divergence at a point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> plus what's the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, you could just do <EXPRESSION>, since it's a constant, as the coefficient on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The correct way to write it is the divergence of our vector field, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then oh, that's difficult because I have these <EXPRESSION> and these <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so the velocity at any point it's a vector field let's say it is, and I'm just going to make up something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first, like I did with gradients, I'll show you the mechanics, which are actually pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's never a y component to the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then for example, here, it'll be even longer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? We just pretended y is a constant, just a number, so the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you took the dot product of that and that, it would be the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of that expression, of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and then plus the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of that second expression, the <EXPRESSION> component of <EXPRESSION>, and then you would evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK let's say the velocity of fluid, or the particles in fluid, at any point in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, let's say it = <EXPRESSION> plus, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> there's never any, sorry <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is the unit vector in the y-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just take the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> component with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and you add that to the partial derivative to the y component with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's make this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'll try to give you the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see what divergence is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's try to get a little bit of intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I have a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would that look like? I don't need a computer to draw this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has no <EXPRESSION> component; ignore this right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One thing to immediately realize, even before we work on the intuition, is when we did gradient I gave you a surface and it gave us a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can handle this one myself I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll see; if you just keep your head straight on what's constant and what's not, it's not too bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I gave you a scalar field and you got a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just do one more point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That we just have an expression that if you give me a point anywhere in this vector field, I can tell you the divergence at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I think you'll find that the computation of divergence isn't too difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you wanted to graph it, in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane you'd have a bunch of vectors, and I'll show you how that looks in a second when we go over to intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me do just do one more just hit the point home, and then we'll work on intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you get the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just did the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is = I'll just sample some points and draw some vectors when <EQUATION> let's say <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> there what's the magnitude of this vector? It'll be <EXPRESSION>, right? Actually, let me make this a different number, because it'll make it hard to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's its velocity in the x-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, when you take the divergence of it, you get a value for any point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's going to be <EQUATION>; it's going to be even longer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that my let me erase this; I'll probably need some space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're dealing with a two-dimensional vector here, so let's just stick with two dimensions, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be a two-dimensional vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I said that I had, I don't know, let's say, my vector field is <EXPRESSION> plus so it's interesting; my x-direction is dependent on my y-coordinate plus, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Only in the x-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would this turn out to be? If you took the dot product of this, which is this upside down triangle, with this vector field, what would you get? Well, you would just get the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> dimension with respect to <EXPRESSION>, so you would get it's actually pretty straight forward to memorize; you might not even need this mnemonic right here, this abuse of notation; you might just know it off hand the <EXPRESSION> component, you take the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and the <EXPRESSION> component, you take the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's my velocity to the right? I'll do it in a different color just so that you don't get confused.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The further you go to the right, the faster the particles are moving towards the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it'll be <EXPRESSION> plus what's the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, there's nothing else to hold constant, so it's just like taking the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it once you get it, you're like oh, that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could almost view it as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if that's the y-axis, that's my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And once you have the intuition, at first it will seemed very, I don't know, unintuitive, maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So even though a vector field has all these vectors on it, the divergence tells you an actual scalar number at any point in the field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could just ignore this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to get our heads around the idea of divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the divergence of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll show you why it looks like the dot product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the divergence? So a couple of ways we can write it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "its velocity in the y-direction is just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get a little bit of intuition of what a divergence actually is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you had the <EXPRESSION>, you would do the same thing, so on and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of my vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, I just realized that I ran out of time, so I will continue this in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you remember from the gradient discussion, we said that you can view, although it's kind of an abuse of notation, but you could view this upside down triangle as being = the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the x-direction plus the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the y-direction, which is the j-unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the general idea here, and as we move up in <EXPRESSION> it doesn't change much, right? It doesn't change at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you could just say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION> value doesn't [COUGHS].", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we draw the vector here it'll be even longer, right? If you do it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could almost say you know, that the divergence of <EXPRESSION> I'm going to make up some notation here as long as you get the point across, you can say that the divergence of <EXPRESSION>, that this is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I just wanted you to see something in two dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's happening? On the right hand side, I have particles exiting really, really fast, right? And let's say in a given amount of time, let's say in one second, in one second out of the right side, since the particles are moving really fast, I'm going to have a bunch of particles leave the right hand side, right? And in the same amount of time, I will have some particles come in through the left hand side, but it's going to be a fewer number of particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the partial derivative? So it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's going to be more and more particles in that space over time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what does it mean if we have a <EXPRESSION> divergence? So let's try to create a vector field that has a <EXPRESSION> divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to be getting less dense at any given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When it's positive, if I have a positive divergence, the particles or the field is diverting out of that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It makes sense, right? Because if as we move to the right, and it kind of gets funky if you go into the other quadrant, so we'll stick to the first quadrant while we're trying to get our intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the classic example of a divergence is a field that looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where we left off I was attempting to give you the intuition of divergence and then I ran out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So clearly this area is going to become less dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at any given point has no <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or since we know that this is the velocity of particles, as we go in the <EXPRESSION> direction, the particles go faster and faster to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It only depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But even here, if I were to draw some region, the same amount is entering as exiting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the further we go to the right, or the more we go to the right, the faster the particles are moving to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said OK, when <EQUATION>, the magnitude of the velocity is <EXPRESSION> maybe meters per second, if that's our unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I was drawing it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the magnitude of the vectors, no matter what my value of <EXPRESSION>, is always going to be the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the classic example of a divergence, although I wanted to show you that what matters is the net that's coming in to a certain area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all of the velocity is only in the <EXPRESSION> direction there is no upwards movement in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the previous example it was a source of particles more were coming out than going in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take an arbitrarily I'm going to draw it in a different color and this circle could be arbitrarily small, but I'm drawing it pretty large so it can include some of our vectors that I've drawn.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the magnitude is always <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the points would be, the vectors would have a slope of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now more going in through the right than coming out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what does that tell us? Well, if you just look at the definition, right, we essentially just took the how much does the magnitude of the field increase in the <EXPRESSION> direction? And we see it visually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's not getting any denser at any point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do a fancier example in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So obviously, in any given amount of time, that point is getting more and more dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So after a certain amount of time what's happening? Let's say after a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "More are leaving than are coming in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I were to graph it this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one half I had all these scratch offs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it makes sense, because as we move to the right our particles are getting faster and faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the divergence I'll use this notation the divergence of our vector field is just a partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's draw it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this positive divergence tells us that at that point, or really at any point in this vector field since the divergence is <EXPRESSION> everywhere, at any point in this vector field, the field is becoming less dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope of how much our <EXPRESSION> component is increasing is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's try to get our handle on what divergence means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I've run out of time again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've never actually heard it this way, but maybe a negative divergence we view as a convergence, right? Converge is the opposite of diverge.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that divergence of <EXPRESSION>, of our velocity vector field you could also view that if you want to abuse some notation, is our del vector, dot <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the classic example of a positive divergence is a point where from every direction things are leaving it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say my vector field is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you have a divergence of <EXPRESSION>, that means that that part of the field is not becoming any more or less dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here at like, say, the point <EXPRESSION>, my velocity is going to be the left <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you could say that more is flowing out of any point than flowing in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me clean it up a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Vector field is always <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we're talking about velocity of particles, after any moment in time, more particles are leaving than coming in because no particles are coming in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EQUATION>, the velocity to the right will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in any given amount of time, in my defined space, it's going to get denser and denser.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to draw a region, what's happening here? Are more particles entering than leaving or leaving than entering? No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's still a constant, right? So this velocity field or vector field will look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's getting denser or you could almost view it as this space is sucking up particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The velocity, I'm just going to rewrite it, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it'll start to make sense once I draw the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a field that looks something like this, this is the classical example of a negative divergence, right? Where from every direction you have particles entering, nothing's leaving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that kind of just falls out of the fact that our derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's this example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where maybe that's the <EXPRESSION> that's the <EXPRESSION>, this is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, let's take that the divergence of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense because the divergence of this vector field well, both of them actually, the divergence of that vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll just stay at a one-dimension just for the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if we only have one dimension, so it's the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> magnitude with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that the vector field = is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that divergence of this vector field at any point is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the point <EXPRESSION>, my velocity is going to be the left <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So every point is getting denser and denser actually everywhere in this field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's infinitely small, but we're just trying to get some intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I have a negative divergence maybe let's define a new term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what a negative divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what this tells us, what this positive divergence tells us is if we were to take let's just take an arbitrarily small circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's = well the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could view a positive divergence as you could kind of say well, the field is becoming less dense at that point, or the point is a source of the field, or it's a source of particles, depending on what model you want to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For any amount that's coming in, an = amount are coming out in a certain amount of time, if we use velocity as our example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually at every point in this field we have a negative divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, with that said, let's take the opposite situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's draw a little circle and see what's happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the way you could think about it is in any given amount of time, what's happening? In this space, I have a few particles entering in through the left, and I have a much larger number of particle leaving through the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, I had defined this fairly straightforward vector field that tells us the velocity of particles in a fluid at any given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the velocity <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm having a few particles leave through the left hand side, right, but I have many more particles entering this little region that I've defined, this little circle, I'm having many more particles enter through the right in a given amount of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way to think of it if you have a constant vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could have done it let me show you another.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As we go, increase in the <EXPRESSION> direction, the field gets stronger and stronger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, even though some particles are leaving through the left, many more particles are coming through the right, so it's getting denser and denser.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's going to happen in this space? It's going to become less dense, right? Because in that space is going to be fewer particles after a certain amount of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could be anywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as we go to the right, our velocities are going getting faster and faster, which means if we were to draw a circle anywhere, we're always going to have more exiting the right than entering through the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If my function was, let's say it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you could almost view it as any given point is almost a source of particles, or if you have a sphere, more particles are going to be coming out of the sphere through the right, than coming in through the sphere to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could almost say let's think about the word, divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me click clear up some space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when is the <EQUATION>? Well, if we factor the <EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing as, we could rewrite our vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the divergence? We take the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we were to draw a circle around here, we see the vectors on the left-hand side of that circle that you can't see, because I can't draw on this graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I could zoom in a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know it's hard to see, but anywhere along the line, you see just as much entering as leaving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know what, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take a look at the graph and see if it if it's consistent with our intuition of what a divergence is, and the numbers we found.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So negative divergence, you can view it as getting denser, or it's actually converging.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we see, the magnitude gets very small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, let's just look at the original vector field, and think about when does that vector field have some interesting points? Well, I think some interesting points are when either the <EXPRESSION> or the <EXPRESSION> are = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we said that at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, we see that in the y-direction it's actually converging, right? Above <EQUATION>, the arrows are pointing down, and below it the arrows are pointing up, right? So in the y-direction, we're actually converging, or we have a negative divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're increasing in magnitude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make it simple so that we only have one thing to factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, something interesting is happening at these two points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's try to figure out, when is the <EQUATION>? So this is divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or we could just say that the divergence of <EXPRESSION>, at any point <EXPRESSION>, so this is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's kind of like particles are getting deflected out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I can delete this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, the divergence is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And going to show you a graph of this field soon, so we'll get an intuition of what it actually looks like, instead of my not-so-accurate drawings.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Up here, we figure the diverge is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So along this line, the divergence of the vector fields <EQUATION>, along the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's only <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION>, so we just take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we want to know, when does that = <EXPRESSION>? So let's set it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we go to the bottom, if we go here on the line, it looks like maybe there are less entering, but there's also less leaving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So on a net basis, between both dimensions, you have no increase or decrease in density along that line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We see that the vectors entering it, the magnitude of the vectors entering it, are larger than the magnitude of the vectors exiting it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we add that to the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could just make this a less than sign then solve, and you'll get <EQUATION>, you want to know when the divergence is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right around here, they're all pointing inwards, , but they get smaller and smaller as you approach the point <EXPRESSION>, 1<EXPRESSION, right? We also said at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At what points are, well, let's first decide, what point is <EQUATION>? Let's say, at what point is a <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if I were to draw a boundary, more is going to be coming out of the right than entering to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>, the divergence is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If that square is my region, we see the vectors on the left-hand side are larger, than factors leaving are larger than the vectors entering it, right? So if, in a given amount of time, more is leaving than entering, then I'm becoming less dense, or you could say that the particles are diverging.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's why the divergence is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And hopefully this will make everything a little bit more tangible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in any given amount of time, more is coming in than leaving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But actually, let's just say the square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, once again, we see the magnitude get small, and then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and we that the magnitudes of the vectors are <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that the velocity of the fluid, or the particles in the fluid, at any given point in the <EXPRESSION> plane, let's say in the x-direction, it is <EXPRESSION> in the x-direction, <EXPRESSION> in the y-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the points where they're both = <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right, because then both components are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we just factored that, that's <EXPRESSION>, and it's the same polynomial, just with , for the y-component, so <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have space to show it, but I think you remember, this is, you know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got our points, we figured out what coordinates are the magnitude of the vector field <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's getting denser, or it's converging.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's consistent with what we found out, that the vector field gets very small at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Things are entering any given spot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have it graphed here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION>, these are just the roots of this polynomial, when <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>, right? And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's look at some of the other points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could be finished there, or we could just put it in our traditional <EXPRESSION> form, that's the way I find it easier to visualize a line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the points where the magnitude of the velocity of our fluid, or the particles of the fluid, are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say at the spot, right? So it makes sense, if our partial derivatives are positive, that means that the magnitude of our vector is getting larger and larger for larger values of our <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, right? So if the magnitude of our vectors are getting larger and larger for larger values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the vectors on the right are going to have a larger magnitude than the factors on the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And does that make [UNINTELLIGIBLE] an arbitrary point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll see that on our graph in a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I can't draw on this graph, but if we drew a circle right there, let's assume that that's on that, the line <EQUATION>, we would see that in a given amount of time, just as many particles are entering through the top right as leaving through the bottom left, right? A lot of entering through the top right and a lot of leaving through the bottom left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I hope I haven't confused you too much, but I have run out of time once again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we said the divergence is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I think we've done all of the analyzing we can do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the definition of our vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say the square is my region, right? This one right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And before I run out of time, I just want to give you that core intuition again, of why the divergence is positive, and why that means that things are flowing out, when the rate of change is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just, there's only an <EXPRESSION> here, so we don't really have to worry about keeping <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the line <EQUATION> starts, the <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and it's going to come down like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here, too, we see that the magnitude of the vectors get very, very, very small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's figure out the divergence of our vector field, the divergence of our field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in the x-direction, things are getting pushed out, right? So the reason why the divergence is 0 here, you might have particles entering above and below a certain space, but you have just as many particles exiting to the left and the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope you can see this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we're above that line, the divergence is going to be positive, right, because if you just made this a greater than sign, that would carry over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could zoom in again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just do the math first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the vectors, though, are about the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, so the divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we actually look at the graph, it makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we figured out, we just figured out when the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> are = <EXPRESSION>, and then we said, when are both of them = <EXPRESSION>? And we said, oh, well at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can divide both sides of the equation by <EXPRESSION>, and you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense, because I have a positive divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's really just a derivative of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we go here, where the divergence is negative, let's pick an arbitrary spot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So anything along, at any point along that line, the divergence is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's do a slightly fancier example, then we'll try to analyze the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me ask another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now before I show you the graph, let's analyze this function a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you have a positive diverge, or you're getting less dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're both = <EXPRESSION> if we have any combination of these points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other interesting thing we said, OK, when does the divergence = <EXPRESSION>? Well, the divergence equaled <EXPRESSION> along the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can simplify this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we set that = <EXPRESSION>, oh, sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say this square right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my major flaw, adding and subtracting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw my twig.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the magnitude of the vectors increase, they increase perpendicular, they increase in the y-dimension, right? And when this happens, when the flow is going in the same direction, but it's going at a different magnitude, you see that any object in it will rotate, right? So let's think about that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that makes sense, also, because as you go in the x-direction, the magnitudes of the vectors increase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You put a twig there, what would happen to the twig? If the twig rotates and there's some curl, if the magnitude of the rotation is larger, then the curl is larger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the top of the twig is going to be being pushed to the right faster than the bottom of the twig, right? So what's going to happen? The twig's going to rotate, right? After, I don't know, some period of time, the twig's going to look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because when we, you might want to review our original videos where we compared the dot product to the cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's going to happen to the twig? Well, at this point on the twig, the water's moving to the right, so it'll push this part of the twig to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the intuition there? All of a sudden, we care about how much is the magnitude of a vector changing, not in its direction of motion, like in the divergence example, but we care how much is the magnitude of a vector changing as we go perpendicular to its direction of motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for given <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of your <EXPRESSION> vector might stay the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that because the vectors increasing in a direction that is perpendicular to our direction of motion, right? This fairly simple example, all of the vectors point in the x-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this Dell operator, we use it a bunch of times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because remember, if this is a vector, and then as we increase this in the x-direction, the vectors increase, we took a little point, and we said, oh, at this point we're going to have more leaving than entering, so we have a positive divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I didn't even label the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> axis.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "And maybe in the x-direction they're constant, regardless of your level of <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude stays.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the dot product was, how much do two vectors move together? So when you're taking this Dell operator and dotting it with a vector field, you're saying, how much is the vector field changing, right? All a derivative is, a partial derivative or a normal derivative, it's just a rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the top of the twig, the water is also moving to the right, maybe with a faster velocity, but it's also going to push the top of the twig to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's just, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, these are just sample points on our vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll see that there's a net torque on the twig.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here, even if we make <EXPRESSION> larger, we still get the same magnitude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so just like what we did with torque, we now care about the direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this might give you a little intuition of what is the curl.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the magnitude of the x-direction is just a function of your <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's enough of just getting the intuition behind that vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The bottom will move a little bit to the right, but the top will move a lot more to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next video, I'll actually compute curl, and maybe we'll try to draw a couple more to hit the intuition home.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it rotates in the other direction, you'll have the negative direction of curl.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the ultimate would be, let me draw another vector field, the ultimate would be if I had this situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I were to, let's say that this vector field shows the velocity of a fluid at various points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I've drawn, I'm going to just draw a two-dimensional vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? And the whole thing would have been shifted to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you put a twig here, you would definitely hopefully see that the twig, not only will it not be shifted to the right, this side is going to be moved to the left, this side is going to be the right, it's going to be rotated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I realize I've already pushed 9 minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's only dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I mean, this vector field might look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, if the partial derivative of something in the i-direction, plus the partial derivative, something with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the j-direction, plus the partial derivative, well, this is if we do it in three dimensions with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the k-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this should be a little bit intuitive to you, at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we applied it to just a scalar or vector field, you know, like a three-dimensional function, we just multiplied this times that scalar function, we got the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if that was where your intuition led you, and that is what your guess is, you would be correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for any given <EXPRESSION>, it's always going to be the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it is a measure of how much is that field rotating, or maybe if you imagine an object in the field, how much is the field causing something to rotate because it's exerting a net torque? Because at different points in the object, you have a different magnitude of a field in the same direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is rate of change in the x-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is relatively low, our magnitude vector goes in the <EXPRESSION> direction, when it increases a little bit, it gets a little bit longer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully that example I just showed you will make a little bit of sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as your <EXPRESSION> get bigger and bigger, the magnitude in your x-direction will get bigger and bigger, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the y direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the intuition, because now we don't care about the rate of change along with the direction of the vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can kind of write it as a vector operator, and then it has a little bit more meeting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just making up numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe after a little bit further, maybe it looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I place a twig right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if you have a different speed for different levels of <EXPRESSION>, as something moves in the x-direction, it's going to be rotated, right? You could almost view it as if there's a net torque on an object that sits in the water here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can extrapolate to <EXPRESSION>, but when we're getting the intuition, it's good to do it in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could imagine up here that's going to the left, with a fairly large magnitude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all you're saying is, when you're taking a dot product, how much is my rate of change increasing in my direction of movement? How much is my rate of change in the y-direction increasing in the y-direction? And so it makes sense that it helps us with divergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We care about the rate of change of the magnitudes of the vectors perpendicular the direction of the vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I were to take a little twig or something, and I were to place it in this fluid, so let me place the twig right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the curl of the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've been dealing with this Dell vector or this, you know, we could call this abusive notation, but it kind of is intuitive, although it really doesn't have any meaning when I describe it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when we learned about dot and cross product, what did we learn? We learned that the dot product of <EXPRESSION> vectors tells you how much <EXPRESSION> vectors move together, and the cross product tells you how much the perpendicular, it's kind of the multiplication of the perpendicular components of a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the curl essentially measures what is the rotational effect, or I guess you could say, what is the curl of a vector field at a given point? And you can you can visualize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as we can see, as our change in the y-direction, as we go in the y-direction, the <EXPRESSION> of our vectors get larger and larger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I place a twig, it's a funny-looking twig, but that's good enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you can view this, we're looking down on a river, maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw another vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we care whether it's going counterclockwise or clockwise, so we're going to end up with a vector quantity, right? So, and all of this should hopefully start fitting together at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if the derivative, the partial derivative, of this vector field with respect to <EXPRESSION> is increasing or decreasing, if it's just changing, that means as we increase in <EXPRESSION>, or as we decrease in <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of the <EXPRESSION> of our vectors, right, the x-direction of our vectors changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before I actually show you the mechanics of what the curl of a vector field really is, let's try to get a little bit of intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I had this situation, where maybe down here it's like this, then maybe it's like this, and then maybe it gets really small, then maybe it switches directions, up here, and then the vector field goes like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's going to rotate a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let me ask you a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the curl, you might guess, = the cross product of our Dell operator and the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we took the dot product of this with a vector field, we got the divergence of the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't want to make that mistake; this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is maybe messier than I originally intended.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Erase that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, so it's going to be well, we can just put the <EXPRESSION> out front, but eventually we want to write our magnitude before the vector so it's <EXPRESSION> times the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> with our constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then this becomes plus, plus, plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just a constant, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll take the curl of a fairly fancy vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then finally our <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll get something fairly hairy, although this was, I think, a hairier than average problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then here it's <EXPRESSION> I should written all of this bigger and then the third column, the <EXPRESSION> component is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, that's pretty much it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I wanted to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just kind of the algorithm of how do you take a determinant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the magnitude in our k-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, right? So the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, that's not what I wanted to do; I wanted to do it in a darker color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do this? So the cross product is going to be = I didn't have to draw a straight line so how you take the cross product of this vector field and the gradient operator? Well, you write <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> on top like you're taking the cross product of any two three dimensional vectors, and then you take the first vector but it's really a vector operator, but it's this del operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, when you were using this engineering notation, when you have a vector broken down into it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components, or it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components, you can take the determinant of that matrix when I showed you how to compute the cross product to figure out the cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, cross these columns there, minus the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = the <EXPRESSION> let me use a more vibrant color the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe we'll graph it for fun just to see how messed up it looks but we said this curl, you could view it as a cross product of our del operator and the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, then finally we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you multiply the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> operator times that expression, you're really just taking, since it's an operator and not an expression, you're really just going to take the partial of this with respect to y, but I'll write it down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the curl of the vector field <EXPRESSION> at any <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have minus because minus in the j-direction what's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, the partial of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why don't we take this row and columns, and this is the submatrix of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now finally, plus, what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, these are just constants, so it's <EXPRESSION> once again, we just have a <EXPRESSION> term; everything else is a constant so the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you cross out it's row and column, and so you take the determinant of this expression, so it's going to be times this times this, but it's really the partial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're pretty much done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean we can simplify it a little bit just to make it clean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this, sorry, we take out it's row and column, so <EXPRESSION> of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just take this expression and I'll multiply it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's actually compute it because if your sole goal is to pass a test and not understand the nature of the universe, which I think would be sad, but if that is your goal you at least need to know how to calculate these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you understood what I did here and now we got this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I think I can erase all of this and just so I can have some room to simplify things in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, now let me try to simplify it, and I'll have to get some space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we are ready to take the determinant, which will probably, well, it'll probably get pretty messy, but let's try it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next video, we'll do a little bit of this, but I think it'll give you more intuition and less of just the algorithm and the computation of how do you do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So its <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components are the partials with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you'll hopefully never forget it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's even more fun when you have the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what are the components of the del operator? It's the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, partial derivative with respect to , right? Let me just rewrite the del operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we just have to simplify it, taking a bunch of partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can view it as being = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now minus the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the second, where we're taking this operator cross the vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, and sorry, when you take the determinant, you use that and this is all kind of a bit of voodoo but you put a plus here, a minus here, a plus here, so it's kind of this checkered pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to have all of that; that's the magnitude in our i-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now what's the magnitude of our curl in the j-direction? Let's cross out the row in the column of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we said that you can view the curl of this vector field and I have no intuition of what this vector field looks like; I just made this up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And essentially we could just, I don't have to rewrite it, we can just multiply this by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what's the derivative of this with respect to y? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me start over, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Erase that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the magnitude in the j-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say our vector field and I'll do a three dimensional vector field just to do a fairly complicated example; I'm just going to make it up on the fly so let's say in the x-direction the magnitude of the field is, I don't know, let's say it's <EXPRESSION>, in the x-direction, plus I don't know let's make it <EXPRESSION> in the j-direction, or the y-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To this is <EXPRESSION>, this should actually be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you have a little intuition now of what the curl is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One that I have trouble visualizing but that we can mathematically chug through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just literally take the cross product of that del operator and your vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll write <EXPRESSION>, and let's put the minus out front; these are what's multiplied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what are the components of the vector field? I'll probably run out of space, but it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> let's put the minus out front <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, so it just carries over, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and then we have minus, now we stick the partial with respect sorry, actually, I forgot to do this part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that should be oh, there we go minus this expression, the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> and now we're on to our <EXPRESSION> component plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the z-direction, I don't know, let's make it <EXPRESSION>, in the z-direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's how you calculate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's our new vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I had a little stick here, I'd be pushing in this direction, with not that much of a magnitude in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the difference in magnitudes of these <EXPRESSION> you could almost view them as the torque producing forces the difference in magnitude is enough that you'd still have the same counterclockwise rotation here as you would have here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's do a little experiment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the curl, at any point of this vector field, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if that makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was our old graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or nothing would be entering into that circle, or in any given amount of time the concentration of that circle wouldn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which would have meant that we would have had no rotation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this term let's see, partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just because I have <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even though this looks like a two dimensional vector field, we actually have to take the cross product in <EXPRESSION> dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're done analyzing this vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the [? ink ?] kind of holds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> component is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, you could put a twig anywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make the window bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would have the forces or the fluids pushing in in this direction, but they're not helping to rotate, and pushing out in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's not going to help me either.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's pretty neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of the if you think of it as force or velocity of the vector field is going to be applying translation to objects in that field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me actually change it to my new vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where we are in the <EXPRESSION> coordinate and the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we do have some fluid or particles coming in at a certain velocity from the bottom right and the top left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, now I've run of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'd be pushing down to the right in this direction, so it would cause it to spin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know you can't read it, but that's that <EXPRESSION> there, and that's the <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I put a twig in the center, or some kind of stick in the center, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the curl of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm definitely not going to rotate there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the torques must be just perfectly offsetting each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "For example, if I put a twig here, it's going to be pushed outward by the flow of the water, by the velocity of the water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the divergence of this field is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, just for fun, let's think about the divergence of that field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be = well, see the <EXPRESSION> component let's cross out its column and its row.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to, I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why don't we just cross all of that out? And that makes intuitive sense, too, right? Because at least from <EXPRESSION> point of view, the rotation is although, the rotation, if you think about it, is going to be in the direction perpendicular to both the <EXPRESSION> direction and perpendicular to the direction in which it is changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one should be a little bit cleaner to calculate than the last example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As far as <EXPRESSION> concerned, <EXPRESSION> is also constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all of that times <EXPRESSION> minus and now it's going to be the <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So because the curl is a constant positive number, when we look at <EXPRESSION> plane like this, if you put a twig that same twig anywhere where you put it on this plane it'll have the same counterclockwise rotation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where you're not going to have any rotation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It = our del vector operator, cross <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in the middle, it definitely makes sense that something is spinning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first, let's just chuck through this, and figure out it's curl.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the curl is <EXPRESSION> everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you were to stick something, especially in the middle, it's very clear that it would spin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, it wouldn't spin as much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do the divergence of this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe a twig might be pushed in a direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The curl is the same throughout this entire vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what might be a little unintuitive you might think, wow, well, wouldn't something spin faster near the center than it would here? Why is the you know, the curl we got is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's not going to rotate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If that confuses you, don't worry about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this was <EXPRESSION> then this would have been <EXPRESSION>, then this final term we would have taken the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and so this would have been <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And does that make sense? Well, if we take a circle anywhere here let's take it in the center, because the center's the most interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cross out its row and column, the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> component is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the bottom left, I'm also pushing up and to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what this vector field looks like, and let's see if that gives us if our intuition holds in this example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's its <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what happens if I were to change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could kind of view it orthogonally, to its direction of motion, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, you do plus minus plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you take the cross product, you still have to do it in <EXPRESSION> dimensions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Row and column.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be perpendicular to both of these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is nothing but this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase this real fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I had an infinitesimally small circle, or sphere, in this vector field, I would have no net density increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, plus its <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or the partial derivative of the [? vector ?] <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, this is called an irrotational I think that's the word vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I have the vector field <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, as far as <EXPRESSION> concerned, <EXPRESSION> is a constant, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I were to draw a circle here, because the divergence is 0, it's telling us that whatever's coming in in 1 direction is coming out in the other directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If both of these only have <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> components, your actual result is going to be in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as our <EXPRESSION> dot our vector field, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's simplify it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because a curl is just like torque, and when you like we did the right hand rule when we studied well, I hope you watched some of the videos on magnetism and torque but the torque actually goes in a direction that is perpendicular to both of the vectors in your cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even in the other case, when this was a minus, it still would have been <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all we're left is with this last term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me try to make it a little bit bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to think about the divergence of that field, it's fairly easy to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I think it's clear, you know, right when you look at it, that this vector field looks like it's spinning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then our curl would have been <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What would have happened if this was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll simplify it above it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So minus and this is the <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have no <EXPRESSION> component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is our vector field <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever's coming in through here and here is leaving through there and there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm not getting any denser, or any less dense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, lets simplify this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And that's true pretty much anywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus and then my magnitude in the <EXPRESSION> direction is dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But just as much is coming out through the top right and the bottom left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what if I had that same stick here? You'd say, well, on the top right I'm pushing up, up and to the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's even though I kind of have curl in the <EXPRESSION> direction, or I have curl in the y direction, they're offsetting each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you'll be like, whoa, that's kind of implying that the field is making something spin equally, no matter where you are in the field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the intuition of that? Well, if we just look at it mathematically, if we have <EXPRESSION> curl, somehow, the rotation in our <EXPRESSION> direction must be being offset by a rotation in the y direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if it doesn't, then you could apply the same argument to the <EXPRESSION> vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The vector at any given point = minus or the magnitude of my <EXPRESSION> direction is actually dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if that makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that in <EXPRESSION> dimensions, I actually end up having no rotation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have no divergence or convergence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always fun to just interpret a vector field to death.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which implies, or which means, that I could put a twig anywhere here and I'm not going to get any kind of rotation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just do that experiment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it would.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the divergence of that vector field, is just a partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we write that it's the definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what if and I'm just going to draw an abstract surface here let me draw some axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we had a well, actually let me go the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I had some constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's call that, you know, this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can kind of view it as the domain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, before, our domain was just at least, you know, for most of what we dealt with was just the x-axis, or kind of the real number line in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this line right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives us the area of this blue sheet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it's not, you might want to review the definite integration videos.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But hopefully, you'll now see the parallel of how we extend this to taking the volume under a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you're going to find out that actually calculating the volumes are pretty straightforward, especially when you have fixed <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> bounds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my z-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A constant <EXPRESSION>, a line like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just show you what a surface looks like, in case you don't remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would be the volume of that sliver? The volume of that sliver will be this function of <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Give me an <EXPRESSION> and I'll give you a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have a constant <EXPRESSION>, it would be a line like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would give us an expression so that I would know the area of this kind of sliver of the volume, for any given value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I pick a <EXPRESSION> there, it'll be a different area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just draw something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far, we've used integrals to figure out the area under a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the intuition behind the definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I wanted to figure out the area under this curve, between, let's say, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, a very small change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's my y-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I have some function this is the <EXPRESSION> plane, that's the x-axis, that's the y-axis and I have some function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if we integrated it, from <EQUATION>, which was back here, all the way to <EQUATION>, what would it look like? It would look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make a square bound first, because this keeps it a lot simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say, here, I'll put it into the function and it'll give us a <EXPRESSION> value now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's just review a little bit of the intuition, although this should hopefully be second nature to you at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we wanted to take the sum of all of these rectangles right? There's just going to be a bunch of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm making that that little cut that I took the area of by making it three dimensional.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what we're going to try to figure out the volume of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you give me a <EXPRESSION>, I can tell you the area of the sliver that corresponds to that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now our domain is the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what could I do? If I know the area of any given sliver, what if I multiply the area of that sliver times <EXPRESSION>? This is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this would actually give us a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we have the area in between it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the sum, or the areas that we're summing up, are going to be the height is <EXPRESSION>, and the width is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just call the base of this rectangle <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to take the sums of these rectangles, from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll actually figure out the volume under this surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I had some sliver.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the height is going to be a function of the <EXPRESSION> I have and the <EXPRESSION> I picked.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have to specify bounds, right? From here, we said <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to make them infinitely small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure out the volume under a surface like this? How do we figure out the volume? It seems like a bit of a stretch, given what we've learned from this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> direction, this is the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for some constant <EXPRESSION>, what if I could just figure out the area under the curve there? How would I figure out just the area under that curve? It'll be a function of which y I pick, right? Because if I pick a <EXPRESSION> here, it'll be a different area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just a little bit of review.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that the domain or the region not the domain the region of the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> region of this part of the surface under which we want to calculate the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it'll pop out another number, and if we wanted to graph it, it'll be our height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can write a surface as, instead of <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> I'm sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I multiplied this area times a small <EXPRESSION>, then all of a sudden I have a sliver of volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, I didn't want to confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It depends which <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> we pick down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't practice these videos ahead of time, so I'm often wondering what I'm about to draw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that could be the height of a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the height of this rectangle is going to be <EXPRESSION>, at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's the intuition of what we're going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where you could review that's maybe <EXPRESSION> of the rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This little area that I'm shading right here gets depth of that sheet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could have my <EXPRESSION> let me pick a vibrant color so you can see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It gets some depth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, that's my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One there, one there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that this is <EXPRESSION> = I don't know, that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the area of the rectangle is just base times height, right? Well, we're going to make these rectangles really skinny and just sum up an infinite number of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it would be we said the height of each of these rectangles is <EXPRESSION>, right? That's the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just want to give you the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me try my best to draw this neatly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is our surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then its width is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I could view this now as a very similar problem to this one up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in a vibrant color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I do is, I split it up into a bunch of columns or a bunch of rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an arbitrary <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know, let's say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we had a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION> of if this is <EXPRESSION>, or whatever, you can just call it <EXPRESSION>, right? That's the height of that rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, and that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's part of it's a sheet of paper within this volume, you can kind of view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we're going to do in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we figure out the volume under this? Well, if I just wanted to figure out the area of let's just say, this sliver.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll plot it there and it'll be a point on the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the area I want to figure out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we'll get the area, and if we have infinite number of these rectangles, and they're infinitely skinny, we have exactly the area under that curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully that makes some sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can give any <EXPRESSION> and any <EXPRESSION> and we'll just deal with the reals right now, I don't want to get too technical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of saying that <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, we can write a surface as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say I have some surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we want to figure out is the volume under the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although I'm assuming, to some degree, that that's a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the height is a function of where we are in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you its function in a second, but it's pretty neat to look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, you give me a coordinate in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would be the area of this sheet of paper? It's kind of a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if I added all of those sheets that now have depth, if I took the infinite sum so if I took the integral of this from my lower <EXPRESSION> bound from <EXPRESSION> to my upper <EXPRESSION> bound, <EXPRESSION>, then at least based on our intuition here maybe I will have figured out the volume under this surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that's <EXPRESSION>, right? That's a change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, what is a surface? Well, if we're thinking in <EXPRESSION> dimensions, a surface is going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as you can see, it's a server.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, let me rotate it to its traditional form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? The domain is all of the set of valid things that you can input into a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What are the bounds? You can almost view what are the bounds of the domain? Well, let's say that this point let's say that this right here, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say, the shadow if the sun was right above the surface, the shadow would be right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's like a piece of paper that's bent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if I multiply this whole thing times <EXPRESSION>, I get this volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that this line right here is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where let me draw one of those rectangles where you could view and there's different ways to do this, but this is just a review.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say so, if we wanted to draw it in the <EXPRESSION> plane, like you can kind of view the projection of the surface of the <EXPRESSION> plane, or the shadow of the surface of the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fair enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope you get that, right? This is the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why didn't I substitute it the other way around? Why didn't I say this? Why didn't I say that this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and why didn't I say this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>? Well, as you can see, this would have been useless, right? Because then I can't multiply it times a <EXPRESSION>, and it gets all confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we can make our substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now why was my problem that I gave you silly? Well, I could have simplified this before even doing the substitution, right? I could have said that that's the same thing as the integral of <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "I keep using that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, it's good that it by substitution, because this probably wouldn't have been completely intuitive for you to do just yet, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll continue doing it with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we can say then that <EXPRESSION>, and we know that <EXPRESSION> as well, which is, once again, mind blowing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You raise exponent <EXPRESSION>, and that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, or we could view that as <EXPRESSION>, and of course, plus <EXPRESSION> at the end.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "dx.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this, as we see, simplifies to the <EXPRESSION>, and that that =, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this is <EXPRESSION>, right? I just switched the orders.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you know, every now and then you have to bear with me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And then I multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just = <EXPRESSION>, which is this right here, right, we just set <EXPRESSION> to = this expression, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to switch the orders of these <EXPRESSION> around, no different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, once again, we have this expression <EXPRESSION>, and what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, as we learned, which is <EXPRESSION> of these things that amazes me, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do a couple more problems like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Image, clear image, image, invert.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That looks complicated to you, doesn't it? Well, just like we said, this is a pattern, like we saw in the previous examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make the substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, that's <EXPRESSION> definition for <EXPRESSION>, is number which, when it's raised to the <EXPRESSION> power, it's the derivative of the same expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> actually do cancel out, and you're left with, that this = the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's <EXPRESSION>? Well, we just showed, <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, right? So it's times <EXPRESSION>, and then we have times <EXPRESSION>, right? And I know you're probably not too comfortable with the differentials at this point, but they behave in just the way regular numbers do with a fraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we said at the beginning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And while we know that the answer of this integral, this = <EXPRESSION>, and then, of course, we should add the plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we can now do is substitute these <EXPRESSION> things into this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this is an easy integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do it up here to make it extra messy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the integral of this, well, this is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do things in the wrong order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I might do another presentation where I do slightly harder problems, using this same technique.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think we have time for <EXPRESSION> more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this expression here, <EXPRESSION>, and well, what's the derivative of this? <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's <EXPRESSION>, right? Notice that I'm engineering it so it works cleanly, but most textbooks and tests tend to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>, right? Because this is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just = <EXPRESSION>, right, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we rewrite this top integral, this is just =, I won't switch this time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the integral now becomes, instead of writing <EXPRESSION>, we can write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say to the minus third power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Are we done? Well, I mean, almost, but it would be nice to just take that <EXPRESSION>, and unwind it, and put the <EXPRESSION> back in for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will also switch colors, just to keep things interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we have a <EXPRESSION> that we can use, and then we have its derivative, right? So we can say <EQUATION>, and we can say then, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, we know the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? Because the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do <EXPRESSION> more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only thing different than what you might have seen recently is that instead of an <EXPRESSION>, we have a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can just unwind this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, that's integration by substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, this might be an easier way to think about these type of integrals than what I did in the last presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I just realized, I constructed a very silly problem for you, because you could simplify this before even doing it with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know you're not completely comfortable yet with even this integration notation, why is this <EXPRESSION> sitting there in the first place, but when we do the definite integrals it will make more sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know what you're thinking, Sal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, you see, if you did it in this way, it becomes very complicated, so we don't want to do it like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is just = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of this to the sixth power, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just something you memorize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You always want to move from something that's complicated to something that's simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we want to take the indefinite integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if we were to integrate both sides of this equation, because we're still doing algebra on some levels, anything you do to <EXPRESSION> side of the equation, you can do to the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well we can make this a minus, we can make this a minus sign of <EXPRESSION> and make this a plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> simplifies things a lot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, everything we have in our integration tool kit so far I don't think help us here, right? Because we don't have a function and its derivative, so we can't do substitution or which is the same thing as the reverse chain rule this isn't a simple polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't proven it to you yet, but it's usually in the inside cover of your calculus book.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>? It was the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We always, in math in general, you always want to simplify.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the intuition, and let me just solve through it, and hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, yeah, it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did I just do? It looks like I just well, I am just essentially playing with the product rule from differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess if you have this in your tool kit and actually you have it beyond the exam on this type of integral, and you actually keep it and you retain it, then you, I think, will become an integration jock.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>? We can ignore this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all I did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I assume that <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> this yellow term, let me write it in yellow, just for fun so <EXPRESSION> so I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same exact thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't even have to look it up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just move forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not making it any more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Indefinite Integration (part V) I'm not going to do a presentation on a type of integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to take the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you would agree that we've now simplified this a good bit, because this is just the integral of <EXPRESSION>, right? So this is just = <EXPRESSION> this is just this first term right here minus and what's the integral of <EXPRESSION>? Well, the derivative of well, let me make it even simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's an introduction to integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I already said that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you encounter this when you're doing integrals, kind of the last tool kit and this is pretty sophisticated is to do integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this might seem a little bit arbitrary, and it is a little bit arbitrary, let me take well, I could take either of these but let me just take this <EXPRESSION> and move it to this side of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This can be a little confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll show you where this is useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, let me show you what I'm talking about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say I had <EXPRESSION> functions, let's say <EXPRESSION>, and I wanted to take the derivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now it's really easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we could say this so let me change colors, because this could get confusing this term right here, we could say that term <EXPRESSION> = this term let me switch back to the yellow = <EXPRESSION> minus this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to subtract this term from both sides of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason why I knew <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is because I said the derivative, I said <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, we said <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? So the derivative is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I like this more, because it naturally makes more sense to me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we also want to take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we should never forget the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But when you do calculus it's been about fifteen years since I learned it and I just remember integration by parts is just really a derivation of the product rule, and that gets me back to the format.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is just as complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason why I'm going to assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and I'm going to assume <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, is because later we want to take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might want to memorize it for the exam, because it's faster for when you take the AP exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, well I'm running out of space, but I'll write it in the corner right down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I can use it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do and you might view this as, well, Sal, how did you know to do this? And I'll tell you my thought process actually after I show you what I did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we just used the product rule to derive this formula for integration by parts, and in a lot of calculus books they do this <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you probably wondering, well, Sal, this is all nice and it looks fancy, but what good is this going to do me? Well, what I essentially just did is I kind of proved this you could call this a formula, but I often forget it, especially once I haven't done it a long time, and then I actually just reprove it to myself just by remembering the product rule but this is called integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well the chain rule just told us that this is just the same thing as, let's say, the derivative of the first function <EXPRESSION> times the second function <EXPRESSION> plus now the first function <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the second function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope you understand what I'm saying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll show you where I'm going with this in a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next presentation, I will do a bunch of examples well, as many as I can fit in to <EXPRESSION> minutes of actually using integration by parts to solve fairly fancy integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this situation, we could assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and we could assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or we could assume the other way around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I put it onto this side of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write it separately here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, try it the other way around, and you'll see that if you took the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, you would get something that's more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this is minus the integral of the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just remember what the product rule of differentiation was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so how can we use this for integration by parts? Well, integration by parts tells us that if we have an integral where we have a function and then the derivative of another function, then we could use this formula to hopefully simplify it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you know, if the function if the derivative of a function is cosine, then we know the function itself is sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's easier for me to read, and I can derive at any time, just from the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we were to integrate both sides well if you integrate this side, you're taking the integral of a derivative, you just get back to what you took the derivative originally of, so this just becomes <EXPRESSION>, and then we have to integrate the right hand side, well that just becomes and we're doing the indefinite integral, kind of the antiderivative, but we can use this tool when we do definite integrals as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I don't have to necessarily memorize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you're seeing it on an exam, you know it's a solvable integral, and if you can't solve it any other way, it's probably integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me try to stay color consistent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't want to forget my dx's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know that if I take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, that simplifies it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's probably a good idea to say that <EXPRESSION> = it's probably, let me change colors it's probably a good idea to make <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, because later I'm going to take the derivative of it, and the derivative of it simplifies it, and it's probably a good idea to make <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, because later, I'm going to take the antiderivative of it, and the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's minus the integral of the derivative of the first function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But once again, when I look at this, I'm like, well, how do I solve this? I can't use the integration by substitution, because there's not an embedded function and then I have the derivative of it sitting right next to it, so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's <EXPRESSION>, and then this minus, you distribute it so it becomes a plus, so then it's plus <EXPRESSION> I just took the minus, I multiplied it times this minus, so I got a <EXPRESSION> and then the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Pretty fancy, no? We've figured out the antiderivative, the indefinite integral of <EXPRESSION> is this big fancy thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It actually turns out you'll just have to do this many many many many times, but every time you do integration by parts, that the exponent on the x-term just becomes smaller and smaller and smaller until you get to something that's really easy to integrate, and then you can do it, and you'll have kind of this big long expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can kind of keep reverting back to the top formula if you get confused.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if that is the case, that this integral is going to = because we have the minus sign out front, this minus sign out front this integral is going to = <EXPRESSION> where <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe not soon, but in the next couple of weeks, on just a lot of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're kind of doing integration by parts within integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I bet you, before listening to this video, you would never imagine that you could tackle integration like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just so and it's a little messy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I would try to see, is there the derivative of something, of <EXPRESSION> function, of kind of a composite function here so I can do the reverse chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well the integral of <EXPRESSION>, or the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? So let's write that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, we're kind of doing a new problem within the original big problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And really, once you know that you should use integration by parts, I think you'll find that it's not that hard to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I took the antiderivative of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say let me do it separately let's assume I think you getting a little bit of the hang of it along the same vein, that this is <EXPRESSION>, that this is <EXPRESSION>, and that this is <EXPRESSION> now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> I don't want you to think that I'm somehow putting <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I go into this term right here, I'm going to have to pick up my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then from that, we subtract the integral, we take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, so you get <EXPRESSION>, and then times the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it just says that if we have an integral of <EXPRESSION> so if you see, within the integral, sign, <EXPRESSION> function and then you see the derivative of another function, and I think with practice integration by parts is really a bit of an art.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> here is <EXPRESSION>, so I can't do anything here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In real life, it might be an unsolvable integral, and you'd have to use a computer or some other technique.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way I think about the chain rule is I want to simplify it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just write the formula for integration by parts, and if you ever forget it I mean, it doesn't hurt to memorize it, but if you ever forget it you just really have to just derive it from the product rule of differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just so we don't lose track of our original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I saw this out of the blue, and I didn't know that this was a presentation on the integration by parts, I would first clearly this isn't a polynomial, so I can't just do a simple polynomial antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't like this color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to rewrite everything we've done it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It might be tedious, it might be hairy, but at least you have a tool kit or you have something in your tool kit that you can tackle integral problems like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've taken the antiderivative, it just happens to be the same function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, but <EXPRESSION> is still just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to pick my <EXPRESSION> out of probably <EXPRESSION> of these <EXPRESSION> functions, so that the <EXPRESSION> is simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can try <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, we're saying <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I need to pick my <EXPRESSION>, I would guess that either <EXPRESSION> is going to be my <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> is going to be my <EXPRESSION>, and I want to pick that so that when I take the antiderivative of it, it's going to be simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually let me write out the whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I think you see where we're going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it looks like I've simplified it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This integral looks easier to solve than this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I use the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just do some problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or at least, not more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I should probably stay at least keep the colors kind of consistent, so you know what I'm hopefully doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we said <EXPRESSION> now don't get confused we're saying <EXPRESSION> let me write it in a corner down here we're saying that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The hard part is to recognize when you should use integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I also know that the and once again, this is <EXPRESSION> of my, to me, a very mind blowing idea but that the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I think we have an integral that is pretty straightforward to solve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll probably do <EXPRESSION> more video on integration by parts, just because I think this is <EXPRESSION> of the harder concepts to really grasp and feel comfortable with, and then I'll try to do a bunch of examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the integral of we could take this <EXPRESSION> out of this, and I think it becomes pretty obvious what's the integral of <EXPRESSION>? This is a scratch-out, this says <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could actually try <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see if we can apply this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From my point of view, it's kind of my last resort, or once you have a lot of practice, you might recognize, well, if there's an <EXPRESSION> in it, or if there's a trig function in it, and I can't do the reverse chain rule or integration by substitution, then integration by parts is probably my best option, assuming I'm seeing this on an exam and not in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The example using <EXPRESSION> might be a little complicated, because it's hard to tell whether I've taken the derivative or not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we assume what I'm doing is right, then what did we say? Well here, we just multiply the <EXPRESSION> real functions, right? So when I say the real functions, I mean not the derivatives of <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, you take the antiderivative, it's still <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION> now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I'm now going to do just a bunch of integration by parts problems, as many as I can do in <EXPRESSION> minutes without confusing you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not systematic that's <EXPRESSION> that = <EXPRESSION> of access times <EXPRESSION> this is how it's the product rule in reverse minus the integral of the derivative of the first function, <EXPRESSION>, times the second function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then of course, we should never forget the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to mix it up so that hopefully you can get a sense of how I try to figure out which of my integration tools I should use for a certain problem when I see the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the antiderivative of the second function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not going to become any more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I need to do integration by parts again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, if <EQUATION>, then <EXPRESSION> is also = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I want to take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it kind of easy to memorize, because there's this symmetry to the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> and then I would take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The anti-derivative of this function is once again just <EXPRESSION> and then f times that function unchanged time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although we could do this problem the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the original problem, <EXPRESSION> =, and now let me switch back to this color, it = <EXPRESSION>, and then I can just this parentheses doesn't matter because I'm just adding everything in the parentheses <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should actually do some integration by parts problems without <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take integration by parts again, see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the integral of <EXPRESSION> you probably never heard of someone call a math problem a classic, but hopefully I will instill in you this love for mathematics and you will also consider this to be a classic problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which doesn't really make a difference because whenever I take the anti-derivative of it to <EXPRESSION>, it stays the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is <EXPRESSION>, what's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So integration by parts, as we take the original functions, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's just a fun problem to see because one, it's the example a lot of people use, sometimes even a trick problem that's given on a really hard math exam, or if you go to calculus competitions like I used to in high school.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It seems like I just keep adding terms, making it more and more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just use <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write it out, this is very exciting, it's the home stretch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same thing happens when you take the anti-derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully I haven't confused you too much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I also think is cool is even if you just look at this solution, it's kind of neat, right? The anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION> and actually never forget the plus <EXPRESSION>, that would've given me minus <EXPRESSION> point on the exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, because <EXPRESSION> literally doesn't change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I want to subtract the indefinite integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you might already see where I'm going with this, because these are both fun functions, because <EXPRESSION> you can take the derivative, you could take the anti-derivative and it still stays <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm now going to do it integration by parts problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I actually took the anti-derivative of it, but it's the same exact thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's a pretty neat property, and you might want to graph them and play with them, but it's kind of neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same as this, which are both the anti-derivative of this, although they are all the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We actually never even have to evaluate this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we're getting anywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll experiment doing it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know it's really messy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take <EXPRESSION> anti-derivatives you get back to the negative of itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you take <EXPRESSION> derivatives, you get back to the negative of itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me use a new color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also a pretty cool function and I think you can start to see how integration by parts might be cool here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to switch colors, I don't like this blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could put the minus here, that'll make it look messy, I could put the minus here that'll make it messy or I could just put minus here and make these minuses cancel out and I get a plus here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's pretty neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say we want to take the integral it's a bit of a classic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's kind of cool, <EXPRESSION> is this expression that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to write this first part <EXPRESSION> plus and now let's do integration by parts again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same thing as this, just a minus right? So we're going to do something what I think to be fairly cool.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the anti-derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, this is just a fun integration by parts problem because you actually never have to evaluate the final integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully I have convinced you that is a classic of a problem, and you also find it neat, and I'll see you in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not to make myself too I was actually not that geeky as a high school student, but I have to admit, I was a mathlete.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can think about why that happened, right? Because these trick functions cycle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not as cool as <EXPRESSION>, it doesn't stay exactly the same, but it kind of cycles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we had to do integration by parts twice to get back to where we were before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See anything interesting? Exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now you might think that I arbitrarily switched colors here when I rewrote this, but if you look you might see why I actually did switch colors here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order to see if we're getting anywhere, let me just rewrite the whole thing and maybe get rid of these parenthesis, because it's just a plus, so we can get rid of the parenthesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wouldn't be surprised if your math teacher does the same problem for you, just to show you integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For this round of integration by parts this was <EXPRESSION>, but now, for this around, I'm going to assume it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just the same thing as <EXPRESSION> times the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whenever I do integration by parts I always like to assume that this is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I have to do now to solve this integral is divide both sides by <EXPRESSION> and I'm done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So once again we are not clear whether we've made any progress.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We've gone from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's add this term to both sides of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's neat how integration by parts allowed us to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the average of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So integration by parts tells us we take <EXPRESSION>, so I take this function and the anti-derivative of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's like this cycle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take this and put it on this side of the equation, what happens? I then have <EXPRESSION> of these on the left side equation, so that becomes I mean I could write it out it's <EXPRESSION> plus, right? Because I'm taking this and I'm putting it on that side of the equation, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take this and let's put it on to this side of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's very hard to keep track of what I've done here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just going to write on the right side of the = sign, because this might get a little long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we use that to solve it without actually having to evaluate the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We said, this integral is just the original problem again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, I get and I'm going to try to write it so you can see everything <EXPRESSION> = and on that side I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to assume that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the anti-derivative and this is also the anti-derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that = this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> you take the derivative, you go to minus sign of <EXPRESSION>, you take the derivative again then you to <EXPRESSION>, then you take the derivative again then you get a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From that I subtract the integral of the anti-derivative of this or I take <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>, and then the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let's assume this is <EXPRESSION>, and let's assume this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can view this as a <EXPRESSION> or, this negative divided by a negative, they're going to cancel out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, and then you want to divide by <EXPRESSION>, and I'll do it explicitly here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could rewrite this, this = let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> = what? What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? it's not quite <EXPRESSION>, right? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're like wow, this <EXPRESSION> was just an <EXPRESSION>, or if it was just a <EXPRESSION>, this would be a really easy integral to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then of course this has the exact same form as this thing right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you kind of do see a pattern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then up here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This it also be written as he wrote it in email, so I don't know how he exactly saw it, but it can also be written as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> right up there, what is that =? Well we just solved for it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would just be the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in general you know to do <EXPRESSION> substitution, or integration by substitution when you see something and you see its derivative sitting there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The same thing as <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it on the side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EQUATION>, so let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just multiplied both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You increase your exponent by <EXPRESSION>, and then you divide by whatever your new exponent is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when you divide this by <EXPRESSION> you get this minus out front, and then of course you'd have the plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's rewrite this original problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then here we do the same thing we did up here, although now we have a minus out front, that actually makes it a little bit cleaner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You increase the exponent by <EXPRESSION> and then you multiply by what your new exponent is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's multiply both sides of this by a <EXPRESSION>, and you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same thing as the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, and we know how to take the antiderivative of something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know how to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I know I'm running out of space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we say <EXPRESSION>, and let's take the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Another u-subsitution example Evan from Norway has asked me to do another <EXPRESSION> substitution problem, and I like these because it gets my momentum going for doing other things that maybe take a little bit more preparation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you would, [? let me do the, ?] increasing the exponent <EXPRESSION>, you'd increase the exponent, you'd get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes it's written like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What was our substitution that we started with? <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To take the antiderivative, we raise <EXPRESSION> it was to the <EXPRESSION> power, let's raise it to <EXPRESSION> power higher than that so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you had this negative that was sitting out there before, so that negative is still going to be there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where this <EXPRESSION> is you have a cosine there, and then we have cosines derivative there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know how to do this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we can multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we want to substitute for this, here we have a minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be <EXPRESSION> I'm sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever is easier for you to conceptualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we could get it in a form that looks like this, we'd be all set.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that we can replace with this, minus du.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me rewrite it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now this integral becomes and the denominator, instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's = minus du.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the problem he sent me and I hope I pronounced his name right was the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little bit less ambiguous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EQUATION>, this thing = <EXPRESSION> = the antiderivative of our original problem, which was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either way, I like looking at this a bit better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you're just left with <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> is the antiderivative oh sorry, we're not done yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you'd decrease the exponent by <EXPRESSION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This integral would be easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, right? We made that definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course you're going to have a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't believe it take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just the antiderivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have our substitution to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the big clue that we should be using <EXPRESSION> substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we're going to do is we're going to substitute <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could have rewritten this top integral, we could have rewritten it like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just writing it a bunch of different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Keep that in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually, if you look at it, I mean you could just eyeball it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well let's look at this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me graph that as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, this is the velocity, so say we had over this very small change in time, we have this roughly constant velocity that's on this graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let actually use an example from physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write this in the corner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, and then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a horrible line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, the object started at position of <EXPRESSION>, but it could be, you know, at any constant, right? You could have started here and then curved up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I won't draw it that steep because I'm going to use this for an illustration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the purposes of this lecture, you can't go back in time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's actually a pretty steep line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this roughly constant velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know why the convention is to use s as the variable for distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me switch to something more pleasant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just a formula that tells us the position, kind of how far has something gone, after <EXPRESSION> many, let's say, seconds, right? So after like, <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone, let's say the distance is in feet, this is in seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I guess if you view it the other way, if you have the velocity, it's antiderivative is distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can kind of view this as a very small change in time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you have to distance formula, it's derivative is just velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to find the change, the instantaneous change with respect to time of this formula, right? Because this is the distance formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll get pretty close to, as you can imagine, the area under this curve, or in this case a line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's slightly better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we want to figure out what the distance is after, you know, <EXPRESSION> seconds, right? So this is the t-axis, this is the velocity axis, right? So let's say we were only given this, and let's say we didn't know that the antiderivative of the velocity function is the distance function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how much time goes by.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that <EXPRESSION> =, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this presentation, I actually want to show you how we can use the antiderivative to figure out the area under a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we draw the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have a constant, this red is kind of bloody.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Skinny and tall, right? It's almost infinitely skinny, but it's, we're assuming for these purposes it has some very notional amount of width.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually I'm going to focus more a little bit more on the intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should switch back to, let me write that, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me undo that too, because I just want to do it for <EXPRESSION>, right? Because you can't really go back in time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the distance that the object travels over the small time would be the small time times the velocity, right? It would be whatever the value of this red line is, times the width of this distance, right? So what's another way? Visually I kind of did it ahead of time, but what's happening here? If I take this change in time, right, which is kind of the base of this rectangle, and I multiply it times the velocity which is really just the height of this rectangle, what have I figured out? Well I figured out the area of this rectangle, right? Right, the velocity this moment, times the change in time at this moment, is nothing but the area of this very skinny rectangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have, over any small period of time, right, or if we have a constant velocity, when you have a constant velocity, distance is just velocity times time, right? So let's say we had a very small time fragment here, right? I'll draw it big, but let's say this time fragment it is really small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this curve will essentially just be a parabola, right? It'll look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we know the instant rate of change of distance with respect to time, we'll know the velocity, right? So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, =? So what's the derivative here? It's <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you can actually view it as instantaneous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me take do it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it would also get you pretty much the exact amount of distance you've traveled after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's actually <EXPRESSION> of the initial uses of what made derivatives so useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll use distance and velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this, I'll draw it in red, this is this going to be a line, right? <EXPRESSION> it's a line with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I think I'm running into the <EXPRESSION> minute wall, so I'm just going to pause here, and I'm going to continue this in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what if we wanted to figure out what the velocity of this object, right? This is, let's see, this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is, I don't know if it's clear, but this is kind of <EXPRESSION> a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, let's just assume we started at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's graph this function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all that says.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone <EXPRESSION> feet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's pretty straight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After <EXPRESSION> seconds, right? Well then, all we would have to do is, we would have to just figure, we would just do a bunch of <EXPRESSION>'s, right? You'd do another <EXPRESSION> here, you'd figure out the area of this column, you'd figure out the area of this column, the area of this column, right? Because each of these areas of each of these columns represents the distance that the object travels over that <EXPRESSION>, right? So if you wanted to know how far you traveled after <EXPRESSION> seconds, you'd essentially get, or an approximation would be, the sum of all of these areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of distance is velocity, the antiderivative of velocity is distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm doing pretty good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is that graph, and this is distance, right? So in case you hadn't learned already, and maybe I'll do a whole presentation on kind of using calculus for physics, and using derivatives for physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What would the velocity be? Well the velocity is just, what's velocity? It's distance divided by time, right? And since this velocity is always changing, we want to figure out the instantaneous velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The object, every second you go, it's going a little bit further, right? So it's actually accelerating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that'll have to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have to use the line tool, might have better luck.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually this could be a good review for derivatives, or actually an application of derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Graph it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How would we figure out, how would we figure out what the distance would be at any given time? Well let's think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This will actually be a fairly straightforward graph to draw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there we figured out the area of this column, right? Well, if we wanted to figure out the distance that you travel after, let's say, you know, I don't know, let's say <EXPRESSION>, let's say <EXPRESSION>, right? This is just a particular <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we have a very small change of time, and over that very small change in time, we have a roughly constant velocity, let's say the roughly constant velocity is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So s is distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that I described the position of something moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's assume that we were only given this graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way I've used <EXPRESSION> is like, it's like a change in time that's unbelievably small, right? So it's like almost instantaneous, but not quite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know why I switched colors, but I'll stick with the yellow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One would think, well actually, I know, why won't they use <EXPRESSION>? Because <EXPRESSION> is the letter used for differential, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the distance function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as you got more and more, as you made the dt's smaller and smaller, skinnier, skinnier, skinnier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's called this very small time fragment, let call this delta <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although you won't know where, at what position, the object started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Introduction to definite integrals Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we said, you know, this is the graph of the velocity of some object.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you had more and more and more and more of these rectangles, then your approximation will get pretty close to, well, <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where I left off, we said that we had this, I guess you could call it, equation or this function, although I didn't write it with the function notation, where I said, the distance = <EXPRESSION>, and I graphed it, it's like a parabola, right, for positive time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So and the way you evaluate an indefinite integral, and let me show you that first, is that you figure out the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tells us <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, well, after <EXPRESSION> seconds, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's a way that you could start to try to approximate how far you've traveled after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds? Well [? as I said, ?] you graph this, and you say, let's assume over some change in time, velocity is roughly constant, right? Let's say velocity is right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So let's say we call this distance <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm running out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also, the area under this curve is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, right? That's evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract it, evaluate at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "Let me clear it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as these <EXPRESSION>'s approach <EXPRESSION>, the number of rectangles actually approach infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, maybe I'll stick with this example, but I'll clear it a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it actually turns out that they're the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could approximate how far you travel over that small change in time by multiplying that change in time, let's say that's like, you know, a millionth of a second, times the velocity at roughly that time, or maybe even the average velocity over that time, and you'd get the distance you've traveled over that very small fraction of time, right? But if you look at it visually, that also happens to be the area of this rectangle, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just, the velocity is always changing, you can't just take the slope, you actually have to take the derivative, right? So we took the derivative with respect to time of this function, or this equation, and we got <EXPRESSION>, and this is the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is the definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "and I'm going to take the sum of each of the heights, the height at any given point, which is the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we could actually figure it out, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? We start at <EXPRESSION> feet, and then we moved forward from there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm actually going to, I'll do that more rigorously later, but I think it's very important to get this intuitive feel of just what an integral is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you know all this stuff now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, so going back to the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, let's say we didn't know this at all, and let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, because we just showed that, you know, the derivative of distance is velocity, so the antiderivative of velocity is distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It isn't just this voodoo that happens to be there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The definite integral is literally, and they never do this in math texts, and that's what always kind of confused me, is that you can kind of view it like a sum, like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is where I'm going to teach you the indefinite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, that's how, if you ever write a computer program to approximate an integral, or approximate the area under a curve, that's the way a computer program would actually do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So after <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone <EXPRESSION> feet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, and we evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say you couldn't just take the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I just looked at the clock.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? And the way you evaluate this, is you figure out the antiderivative, and you really don't have to do the <EXPRESSION> here, so the antiderivative, we know, is <EXPRESSION>, right? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the way you figure out the indefinite integral, is you say, and sometimes they won't write <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's actually how I view it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Erasing might be a good option with this one, since it's fairly messy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we said, is if you want to know how far you travel after <EXPRESSION> seconds, you just draw a bunch of these rectangles, and you sum up the area, right? And you could imagine, and you don't have to imagine, it's actually true, the smaller the bases of these rectangles, and the more of these rectangles you have, the more accurate your approximation will be, and you'll approach <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So it's very interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me continue this in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They'll just say from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, that's ugly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The indefinite integral tells us <EXPRESSION> things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the s, or distance, axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's use this to do a couple more examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just need space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we graphed it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could have been a variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the actual indefinite integral says, well, this is a sum, but it's the limit as the bases of these rectangles get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and we have more and more and more of these rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the integral from this is now a definite integral, extending from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that the distance, yeah, well, let's just say it looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the indefinite integral, I don't know how comfortable you are with summation, I remember the first time I learned calculus, I wasn't that comfortable with summation, but it's really, all the indefinite integral, is is you can kind of view it as a sum, right? So now, you'll maybe understand a little bit more why this symbol looks kind of like a sigma.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tells us the area of the curve from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>, right, it tells us this whole area, and it also tells us how far the object has gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe, OK, so we have that indefinite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what's the formula for the velocity? It's <EXPRESSION> and then I'm at times the base at each of these rectangles, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is something pretty interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say you start at some distance, and then it goes off like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to know how far is this thing gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this axis is of course time, this axis, maybe I shouldn't do <EXPRESSION>, because it looks so much like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just say, let me continue with the problem, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's just call this, you know, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll now do it more general, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was like, well, we want to figure out, if we were given this, if we were given just this, and I asked you, what is the distance that this object travels after time, you know, after <EXPRESSION> seconds? Let's, you know, let's say this <EQUATION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of a sudden, we see that the antiderivative is pretty darn similar to the area under the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> feet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we said, well, the velocity, if we know the distance, the velocity is just the change of the distance with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As you can tell, I don't plan much for these presentations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me give you another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, maybe I should erase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, I'm going to do that right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll approach the area under this curve, right, almost the exact area under this curve, and you'd also get almost the exact value of the distance after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds in this case, right? But <EXPRESSION> didn't have to be an exact number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's kind of the sum of each of these rectangles, but it's the limit, as if these were discrete rectangles, you could just do a sum, and you could make the rectangle bases smaller and smaller, and have more and more rectangles, and just do a regular sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells us area, and it also tells us the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw this twice, once for the distance, and once for its derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? We're already familiar with it as an antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, I want to show you why we do this subtraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And please look it up so you can see properly drawn integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in this case, the indefinite integral is just saying, well, I'm going to take the sum from <EQUATION>, right, so from <EQUATION>, to let's say in this example, <EQUATION>, right, because I said <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I asked a question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Definite integrals (part II) Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, I think it's silly that they're taught as <EXPRESSION> separate classes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? It's going to look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just continuing on with hopefully giving you, one, how to actually solve indefinite integrals and also giving you a sense of why you solve it the way you do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just want to know how far do I travel between <EQUATION> seconds and <EQUATION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you're doing the exact same thing we did here when we actually had this graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me lower the volume, because you're more important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is just <EXPRESSION> and that's, what, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me stick to the old numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we did here, right? This is what we did here intuitively when we worked with distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, interestingly enough, if I just changed this from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and, in general, if you want to figure out the area under a curve from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, it's just the indefinite integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> actually, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you're starting to get a little intuition about why we evaluated that previous indefinite integral in the previous video the way we did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, depending on how you say it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in this case, <EXPRESSION>, right? If these weren't <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, if this was just <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just figure out the antiderivative and we evaluated at <EXPRESSION> and we evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This capital F is just the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? To figure out how far I travelled between <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, I just say <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, right? How far did I go after <EXPRESSION> seconds minus how far I already was after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We evaluated it at <EXPRESSION> and you evaluated it at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, my phone is ringing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll talk about that at another time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the derivative? So let me just call that <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll see you in the next presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because time times a constant velocity = distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So an easy way to do that is I could just evaluate this function at <EQUATION> let me use a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way you evaluate this is you figure out the antiderivative of this inside function, and then you evaluate the antiderivative at <EXPRESSION>, and then from that, you subtract it out at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? I think, actually, this is the fundamental theorem of calculus, but I don't want to throw out things without knowing for sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me graph that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I did all of this, not to confuse you further, but really just to give you an intuition of why <EXPRESSION>, why the antiderivative is the area under the curve, and then <EXPRESSION>, why let's say that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and then why we evaluate it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you evaluated it at <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, going back to this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as you can see this also tells me the area between <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think, actually, the rate of acceleration, if I'm not mistaken, is actually called jerk, but I might have to Wikipedia that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might see this in your books.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we did these <EXPRESSION> videos really just to give you or actually, is this the third or the second just to give you an intuition of why this is, because I think that's really important if you're ever going to really use calculus in your life or write a computer program or whatever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just saying, if I want to figure out the area under a curve from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, that we figure out the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to go make sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's actually draw the derivative of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me clear this up and just rewrite that last thing I wrote, but maybe a little bit cleaner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> should be the larger one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? I'm not looking for the total distance I've traveled.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of this velocity function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say that the distance, s this time I'll write it as a function let's say the distance is I said it started at <EXPRESSION>, so let's say it's <EXPRESSION> let's say this is actually a cubic function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, not only did I figure out the distance between how far I traveled from <EXPRESSION> seconds to <EXPRESSION> seconds, I also figured out the area under this curve from <EXPRESSION> seconds to <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> is just the derivative, right, because it's the rate of change of distance with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> feet is how far I travelled between <EXPRESSION> seconds and <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say that <EXPRESSION> with a big, fat capital <EXPRESSION> = actually, let me do it a better way let me say that the derivative of big fat <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Your velocity doesn't really matter about where your starting position is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and the constant disappears, right? So it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? So this might be <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Definite Integrals (area under a curve) (part III) Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're not only accelerating, your rate of acceleration is increasing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next presentation, I'll use this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>, so the object has gone <EXPRESSION> feet at <EQUATION>, right? And then, at <EQUATION>, the object has gone how far? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, I haven't done math in a long time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually pretty easy to use once you know how to use antiderivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write that in a different color because I think I'm making it messier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See? You're actually learning a little physics while you're learning calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm giving you all this based on intuition, not necessarily what I'm reading.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I did this to give you an intuition of why this works and why the antiderivative is the area under a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, let's say that this is the distance and let me give you a formula, actually, for the distance, just for fun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this case, the antiderivative of this is <EXPRESSION> and we evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and we evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's graph this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's getting messy I could just evaluate this function at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that makes sense, right? Because your velocity doesn't care about where you started off from, right? You're going to be the same velocity if you started from <EXPRESSION> feet or if you started from <EXPRESSION> feet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say I wanted to know how far I travel between <EQUATION> seconds and <EQUATION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say its <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because remember, the area of each of these rectangles represents how far I traveled in that little amount of time, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and all we're saying is that if we take the integral of small <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that this is big <EXPRESSION>, it's antiderivative, at <EXPRESSION> minus the antiderivative at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just going to look like a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think that's often missing in some textbooks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if we just had this velocity graph, if we didn't know all of this over here and I asked you the same question, though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I said, how far does this thing travel between <EXPRESSION> seconds and <EXPRESSION> seconds? Right? Well, I could do it the way that we learned in the previous video where I draw a bunch of small rectangles, each of a really small width, and I multiply it times its instantaneous velocity at that exact moment, right? And then I sum up all of those rectangles look how pretty that is I sum up all of the rectangles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the next couple videos I'll actually apply this to a bunch of problems and you'll hopefully see that it's a pretty straightforward thing to actually compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll get a pretty good approximation for how far I've travelled between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think physics and calculus should just be <EXPRESSION> fun <EXPRESSION>-hour class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "b to a.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative and the antiderivative don't only apply to distance and velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's gone <EXPRESSION> feet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I want to figure out the area between the curve and the x-axis from <EQUATION> to, I don't know, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we can do is maybe you want to pause it and think about it yourself we can figure out the area under the grey curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to shade it in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, right? They both intersect at <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might be confused right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm now going to use definite integrals to figure out the areas under a bunch of curves and, if we have time, maybe even between some curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say I want to figure out the area under the curve between the curve and, really, the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it'll start at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is exactly how we're going to do it in the next video because I have run out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me right down the fundamental theorem of calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "y-intercept at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just the notation they use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But when you subtract here, the constants will cancel out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw a graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do a slight variation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us if this top line is true, then the definite integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> = its antiderivative evaluated at <EXPRESSION> minus its antiderivative evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why I actually said the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'm making a mistake with negative signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could square both sides or well, actually, this is the same thing as doing it by intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of this stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just mechanically compute it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's apply this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could pick an arbitrary <EXPRESSION> right here and it'll just cancel out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>? This just = the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've done worse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, it'll continue on this side as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even this point, you could probably do it from intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you'll get the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right? This is just big <EXPRESSION>, right? Because I figured out the end This is big <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is true for both of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that = <EXPRESSION>, correct? I think so.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to evaluate that at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and we're going to subtract out big <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> from big <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that my <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to figure out this area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's actually a pretty nice looking, kind of sideways parabola, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Draw the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we put <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we have our answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you watched the last videos, hopefully that hit the point home.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm kind of running out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it is defined for negative numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know if I'm going to have time to do it in this video but I'll try.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this = So if I evaluate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that big <EQUATION>, right? That's also like saying that the that's equivalent to saying that <EXPRESSION> = the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, right? Well, let's just that it's <EXPRESSION> of the possible antiderivatives of <EXPRESSION>, right? Because there's always a constant term here and you're not sure whether it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I know I said here that big f isn't the only antiderivative, right? Because you could at any constant to this and that would also be the antiderivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a little bit not true, but I think you get the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we'll just mechanically compute because, actually, understanding it is a bit harder than just doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, from that we'll subtract big <EXPRESSION>, right? Minus big <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But not to be confused with small, cursive <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we will now use the fundamental theorem of calculus and hopefully you have an intuition of why this works and how the integral is really just a sum of a bunch of little, little, small squares with infinitely small bases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll just be a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know I covered it really fast in the last presentation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops! I was doing well and then something happened.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's just <EXPRESSION> we could say <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, right? The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You figure out the antiderivative and you say where you're going to evaluate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we don't have to worry about <EXPRESSION> because we're going to subtract out the <EXPRESSION>'s.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> of the antiderivatives of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Squared units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would have been very difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is what? That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to subtract that, right? So if I'm subtracting <EXPRESSION>, it's the same thing as adding <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could figure out this area and then we could figure out the entire area under the green curve separately and then we could subtract the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is actually going to look something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the area I want to figure out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it really doesn't matter which of the constants you pick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> squared units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think it's pretty obvious that the only places where <EQUATION> are the points <EQUATION>, which you already know, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could write this as a mixed number as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is big <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could figure out this area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is why people tend to use this standard because we know that <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could imagine, before you knew calculus, figuring out an area of something with a curve it's kind of top boundary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is more algebra, so I won't go into that in too much detail.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to figure out this is a boundary, right? Between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Look how straight that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we are essentially just going to figure out the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, my question to you, or my question to myself, really, is what is the area between the curves where they intersect? What is this? What is this area? Well, the first thing you have to figure out is just what are the boundary points? What is this point? And what is this point? Well this point, I think, is pretty clear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you don't, I guess, want to do it through intuition, you could just set these <EXPRESSION> equations = each other, right? You could say <EQUATION>, right? And then you could do a bunch of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say I have another function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just to make sure you understand this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can kind of view this as big <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to figure out the area between these <EXPRESSION> curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The last couple presentations were really to give you an intuition for this exact formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, it's <EXPRESSION> whatever units.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see how good I can draw this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not perfect but it'll do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I always try.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The constant actually doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this big <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION>, right? So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hope I didn't confuse you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is that? That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's kind of neat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just want to make a point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just a fraction problem there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's a function that's a line that just goes straight at <EQUATION>? I think I just gave you the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually instead of doing this, I think you could see that there's symmetry here, so we could just figure out this area and multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's figure out the entire area under <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and we can subtract from that, this purple area, which is the area under <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me stick with that greenish color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Who knows, maybe it'll involve some you know a circle involves pi, which is this really messy number, so maybe all curves have these kind of messy areas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The area under just the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when <EQUATION> what is this expression =? Well that's easy too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do it in a loud color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just put <EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I guess we could figure it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So instead of doing that, let's do the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to have to evaluate this thing at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and subtract the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where I had just left off we were trying to figure out this area between these <EXPRESSION> curves, and we figured out that it's really the area between the curves between the point <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we divide by this new exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, you might actually find this easy, but let's figure out the area between <EXPRESSION> = I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know I find is this of exciting because if just my intuition I was like, oh I have these <EXPRESSION> curves, and I mean they do intersect at the nice integer number, but you know what it's probably going to be some really messy number of what the areas between these <EXPRESSION> curves, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to figure out this area inside the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should have done something with an even exponent so I could have had this cup shape, but anyway the absolute value solved my problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I say <EQUATION>, I think you see where I realized my mistake.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This problem's a little hairy, just because I had a bad choice of initial function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have committed so much to this cup shape that I'll make it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I want to figure out the area inside of the curve where the height here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, and that's half of it, right? So we want to multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't know what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this <EXPRESSION> it's just <EXPRESSION> of those neat things about math.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm about to run out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually that might be even simpler because when you evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> it simplify things a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This could have just been rewritten this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We raise it <EXPRESSION> more power so it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could have said this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we do that? Well <EXPRESSION> way we could do it is just like we did the last <EXPRESSION>, we can figure out some function that's essentially a line, a horizontal line that goes straight across here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I'm running out of space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I was proposing of a way to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the indefinite integral for <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of the top function, the top boundary, <EXPRESSION>, minus the bottom boundary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not exactly what I wanted, but we'll work on forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the mistake, obviously <EXPRESSION> is not a parabola looking thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, some people start this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So dividing by a fraction is like multiplying by its reciprocal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I say <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, there's <EXPRESSION> places where that's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's Kind of like the combined area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could just rewrite a new function, which is the difference of these <EXPRESSION> functions, and it would have been equivalent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do something simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, it was <EXPRESSION>, we added <EXPRESSION> to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Subtract this expression evaluated at <EXPRESSION> from this expression evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we multiply that by <EXPRESSION>, we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a bit of a trick problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to subtract from that the area from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> what's under <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to go up real fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me do <EXPRESSION> more problem since I have time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, the integral of <EXPRESSION>, because <EXPRESSION> is the green function, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and the next is <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, so the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is this area? We know it's between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so we just set up the indefinite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can multiply if I wanted to, but I have <EXPRESSION> seconds left so I'll leave you there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all we just have to figure out what the antiderivative of this inner expression is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could do this <EXPRESSION> separate problems, <EXPRESSION> separate indefinite integrals, or you could do it as <EXPRESSION> indefinite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's stick with the second one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just based on the last example we did, we could just write the indefinite integral, and I'm not going to rewrite the fundamental theorem from calculus, because I think you know that by now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll essentially just be figuring out the area between the <EXPRESSION> functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "x to the fifth goes negative like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we need to figure out what the area is between the <EXPRESSION>, so we need to figure out what are these <EXPRESSION> points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just goes straight across.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that this is not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens when <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, and actually, you know what? I made a mistake.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me draw it actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't figured out what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the <EXPRESSION> points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See those are the same thing as the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could say <EQUATION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this will be a little bit tricky, but <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you haven't seen <EXPRESSION> yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when does <EQUATION>? I mean you could solve it algebraically, you know, you could say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The area between the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is a pretty clean number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "x to the fifth is going to go up super fast, something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I wanted to figure out the areas this side's going to go real fast too between that, and instead of figuring out the area between x-axis and that, <EXPRESSION>, I want to figure out the area between <EXPRESSION> and Instead of figuring out this bottom area, right? Like the normal problems we've done, we would figure out this type of area, you know, between <EXPRESSION> points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do you think you know how to do it? Well, I think you do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I'm going to draw the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This isn't kind of a step of the problem, but you could have done it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to know the larger area, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Magenta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that = <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, right? So we just use the same antiderivative rules we've always used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> and then minus I think the second term is pretty easy for you <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just a constant function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's now evaluate this definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This definite integral is from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now it should be clearer to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to do it however it is least confusing to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How did I know to substitute <EQUATION>? Well because I say, well the derivative of this function is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's really the same thing as what we just did with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we are done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now let's take the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me do it with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just I didn't formally do the substitution, but it's the exact same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing is <EXPRESSION> did that here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, how did I do this? What allowed me to treat this <EXPRESSION> just like an <EXPRESSION> or like a <EXPRESSION> when I did it with the substitution? Well I had its derivative sitting right here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's exactly the same with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well essentially we're just going to do the same thing, but we're going to do it with substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the way I always think about it is, well I have a cosine and a sin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That hopefully we've learned already.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we care about, we're defining the definite integral between <EXPRESSION>, which is roughly here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I find du, this whole thing is going to end up being du, and let me show that to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean if this cube right here is <EXPRESSION>, then that looks about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's good to be able to do it with substitution, helps you from making careless mistakes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is going from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION> going from? Well when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me do it with substitution, just because the way I was just doing is kind of my shortcut back in the day when I was a mathlete.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have cosine of <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just wanted to show you that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the fun part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we erase all of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since the a curve is below the x-axis here, this area is going to be a negative number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've graphed this function right here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was our original substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this is a very important thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what was the chain rule? The chain rule said if I took the derivative of <EXPRESSION> that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's just the same thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the derivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully you found that vaguely useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So before we just chug through the math and do the antiderivatives and use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral, let's think about what we're even doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the antiderivative is <EXPRESSION>, and I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me since we have a little bit of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So between <EXPRESSION> which is right there, and between <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cosine is squared, so all these crazy things are happening to it, so it seems like I could use substitution or the reverse chain rules some out here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me rewrite this first of all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Since the derivative is here, I can just treat this whole thing like an <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we look at this area from our original graph, what we just solved, as we said the area of the curve between here and here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the integral from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The intuition all works out at least.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the cosine of <EXPRESSION>, and then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> or the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Transcript for: Definite integral with substitution So I've been sent this definite integral problem and it seemed as good as any, and I think the key with this is just to see a lot of examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if we have this integral right here, what I do is I say, well I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well it's actually <EXPRESSION>, and we have a minus sin here, so that works out well too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>? If we multiply both sides by the differential <EXPRESSION> get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little bit quicker sometimes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is pretty straightforward and I'm just going to rewrite it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this seems like a simple problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I did is I increased this exponent to get the third, and I divided by that exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That might completely confuse you, but I just wrote that here because we could say, well what if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could just take the derivative of this, you get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you understood this, and if you did, don't worry about what I'm going to do now, but I want to show you how I tend to do it where I just think of it is the reverse chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, hope you found that helpful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we get the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same thing as the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that looks about right, that looks about <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we look at the original equation, this right here we just showed = <EXPRESSION>, and this right here is what? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this confuse you, ignore it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK let me erase that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have a function and it's being squared, and I have its derivative, so I can figure out its antiderivative by using substitution or the reverse chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that gives us immediately an intuition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we're going to have to evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and subtract from that, it evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>? <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make a substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will arbitrarily switch colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what gave me the license to just take the antiderivative, pretend like this <EXPRESSION> is just an <EXPRESSION>, is just a <EXPRESSION>, you could even say, and just take it's exponent, raise it by <EXPRESSION> and divide it by <EXPRESSION> and then evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same thing, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'll rearrange some of the terms here just to make it a little bit easier to read.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or we could do the substitution and reverse the substitution and then evaluate the boundaries, but let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, and so this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, well that's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you're going to do substitution, if we're going to say <EQUATION>, we're going to have to actually make this substitution on the boundaries.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, which is fairly straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the definite integral of this function between here and here is essentially the area of the curve between the curve and the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We should be getting a negative number when we evaluate this and just to prove this I actually typed it in up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if we wanted the absolute area because you can't really have a negative area, it's <EXPRESSION> but we know it's negative because this curve is below the x-axis here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so this = <EXPRESSION> minus this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me a erase this if this confuses people.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: So, we're ready to begin the fifth lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm glad to be back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you for entertaining my colleague, Haynes Miller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, today we're going to continue where he started, namely what he talked about was the chain rule, which is probably the most powerful technique for extending the kinds of functions that you can differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to use the chain rule in some rather clever algebraic ways today.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So the topic for today is what's known as implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So implicit differentiation is a technique that allows you to differentiate a lot of functions you didn't even know how to find before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a technique - let's wait for a few people to sit down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Physics, huh?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, more Physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take a break.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can get those after class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so we're talking about implicit differentiation, and I'm going to illustrate it by several examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is one of the most important and basic formulas that we've already covered part way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what we've got so far is the exponents, <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You did the positive integer powers in the first lecture, and then yesterday Professor Miller told you about the negative powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're going to do right now, today, is we're going to consider the exponents which are rational numbers, ratios of integers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So a is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are integers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's our goal for right now, and we're going to use this method of implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, it's important to realize that this covers the case <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And those are the nth roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when we take the <EXPRESSION>, we're going to cover that right now, along with many other examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is our first example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we get started?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well we just write down a formula for the function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "The function is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we're trying to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there's really only two steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first step is to take this equation to the nth power, so write it <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "Alright, so that's just the same equation re-written.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what we're going to do is we're going to differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to apply <EXPRESSION> to the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "Now why is it that we can apply it to the second equation, not the first equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I should call these equation <EXPRESSION> and equation <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the point is, we can apply it to equation <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason is that we don't know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "That's something we just don't know yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we do know how to differentiate integer powers.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "Those are the things that we took care of before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we're in shape to be able to do the differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to write it out explicitly over here, without carrying it out just yet.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now you see this expression here requires us to do something we couldn't do before yesterday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, this <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have to apply the chain rule here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "So this is the same as - this is by the chain rule now - <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "And then, on the right hand side, we can just carry it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, now this is our scheme.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll see in a minute why we win with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first of all, there are two factors here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One of them is unknown.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it's what we're looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the other one is going to be a known quantity, because we know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "That's the same formula, although the letter has been changed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is the same as - I'll write it underneath here - <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, now comes, if you like, the non-calculus part of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember the non-calculus part of the problem is always the messier part of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to figure out this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This formula, the answer over here, which maybe I'll put in a box now, has this expressed much more simply, only in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we have to do now is just solve for <EXPRESSION> using algebra, and then solve all the way in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "So, first of all, we solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So I do that by dividing the factor on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to plug in-- so I'll write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now over here I'm going to put in for <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So now we're almost done, but unfortunately we have this mess of exponents that we have to work out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to write it one more time.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So I already recognize the factor a out front.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "That's not going to be a problem for me, and that's what I'm aiming for here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now I have to encode all of these powers, so let's just write it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and then it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's the law of exponents applied to this ratio here.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "And then we'll do the arithmetic over here on the next board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have here <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I multiply n by this, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if the second factor is minus minus, that's a plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Altogether the two m's cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And lo and behold that's the same thing as a <EXPRESSION>, just what we wanted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, again just a bunch of arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From this point forward, from this substitution on, it's just the arithmetic of exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so we've done our first example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to give you a couple more examples, so let's just continue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next example I'll keep relatively simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have example two, which is going to be the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's not really a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a way of defining y as a function of x implicitly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the idea that I could solve for y if I wanted to.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "And indeed let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you solve for y here, what happens is you get <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So this, if you like, is the implicit definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here is the explicit function <EXPRESSION>, which is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now just for my own convenience, I'm just going to take the positive branch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just really a circle in disguise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm just going to take the top part of the circle, so we'll take that top hump here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that means I'm erasing this minus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just taking the positive branch, just for my convenience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could do it just as well with the negative branch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so now I've taken the solution, and I can differentiate with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So rather than using the <EXPRESSION> notation over here, I'm going to switch notations over here, because it's less writing.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 77}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "I'm going to write y' and change notations.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "Okay, so I want to take the derivative of this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "Well this is a somewhat complicated function here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and the right way always to look at functions like this is to rewrite them using the fractional power notation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 88}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 130}]}
{"text": "That's the first step in computing a derivative of a square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the second step here is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does somebody want to tell me?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Chain rule, right.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have two things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We start with one, and then we do something else to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So whenever we do two things to something, we need to apply the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the first factor I claim is the derivative of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> blah to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm doing this kind of by the advanced method now, because we've already graduated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You already did the chain rule last time.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So what does this mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an abbreviation for the derivative with respect to blah of blah <EXPRESSION>, whatever it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's the first factor that we're going to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Rather than actually write out a variable for it and pass through as I did previously with this <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> variable here, I'm just going to skip that step and let you imagine it as being a placeholder for that variable here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this variable is now parenthesis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to multiply that by the rate of change of what's inside with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now again, we couldn't have done this example two before example one, because we needed to know that the power rule worked not just for a integer but also for <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 119}]}
{"text": "We're using the case <EQUATION> right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> times, and this <EXPRESSION> here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "- So this is the case <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> happens to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I'm putting all those things together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know within a week you have to be doing this very automatically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to do it at this speed now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You want to do it even faster, ultimately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: The question is could I have done it implicitly without the square roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I'm about to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an illustration of what's called the explicit solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this guy is what's called explicit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to contrast it with the method that we're going to now use today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it involves a lot of complications.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It involves the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And as we'll see it can get messier and messier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's the implicit method, which I claim is easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see what happens if you do it implicitly The implicit method involves, instead of writing the function in this relatively complicated way, with the square root, it involves leaving it alone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't do anything to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this previous case, we were left with something which was complicated, say <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or something complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We had to simplify it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "We had an equation one, which was more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We simplified it then differentiated it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that was a simpler case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well here, the simplest thing us to differentiate is the one we started with, because squares are practically the easiest thing after first powers, or maybe zeroth powers to differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're leaving it alone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the simplest possible form for it, and now we're going to differentiate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "So what happens?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again what's the method?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me remind you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're applying <EXPRESSION> to the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "So you have to differentiate the left side of the equation, and differentiate the right side of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's this, and what you get is <EXPRESSION> = what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the chain rule again.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "I did it a different way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to get you used to many different notations at once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well really just two.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just the prime notation and the <EXPRESSION> notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is what I get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now all I have to do is solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "So that <EXPRESSION>, if I put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side, is <EXPRESSION>, and then divide by <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's compare our solutions, and I'll apologize, I'm going to have to erase something to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's compare our two solutions.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "I'm going to put this underneath and simplify.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what was our solution over here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was what we got over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is the same thing, if I cancel the 2's, and I change it back to looking like a square root, that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula for the derivative when I do it the explicit way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll just compare them, these two expressions here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice they are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the same, because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: The question is why did the implicit method not give the bottom half of the circle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer to that is that it did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just didn't mention it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wait, I'll explain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So suppose I stuck in a minus sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would have gotten this with the difference, so with an extra minus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then when I compared it to what was over there, I would have had to have another different minus sign over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually both places would get an extra minus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they would still coincide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually the implicit method is a little better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't even notice the difference between the branches.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does the job on both the top and bottom half.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way of saying that is that you're calculating the slopes here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's look at this picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's a slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just take a look at a positive value of <EXPRESSION> and just check the sign to see what's happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take a positive value of <EXPRESSION> over here, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "This denominator is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slope is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see that it's tilting down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now on the bottom side, it's going to be tilting up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly what's happening up here is that both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, and this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> are positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the slope is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, on the bottom side,  is still positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's tilting up because the denominator is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The numerator is positive, and this minus sign has a positive slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it matches perfectly in every category.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This complicated, however, and it's easier just to keep track of one branch at a time, even in advanced math.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so we only do it one branch at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now I want to give you a slightly more complicated example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed some of the-- so here's a little more complicated example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not going to be the most complicated example, but you know it'll be a little tricky.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this example, I'm going to give you a fourth order equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now it just so happens that there's a trick to solving this equation, so actually you can do both the explicit method and the non-explicit method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the explicit method would say okay well, I want to solve for this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 63}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "So I'm going to use the quadratic formula, but on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "This is quadratic in <EXPRESSION>, because there's a fourth power and a second power, and the first and third powers are missing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, and <EQUATION> in the quadratic formula.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now you can see this problem of branches, this happens actually in a lot of cases, coming up in an elaborate way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have two choices for the sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have two choices for the sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Conceivably as many as four roots for this equation, because it's a fourth degree equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's quite a mess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You should have to check each branch separately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this really is that level of complexity, and in general it's very difficult to figure out the formulas for quartic equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But fortunately we're never going to use them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, we're never going to need those formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the implicit method is far easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The implicit method just says okay I'll leave the equation in its simplest form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now differentiate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So when I differentiate, I get <EXPRESSION> plus - now here I have to apply the product rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 75}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "So I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> separately.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "First I differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION>, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Then I differentiate with respect to the other factor, the <EXPRESSION> factor.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the implicit differentiation step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I just want to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So I'm going to factor out <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "That's the factor on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the formula for the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have a question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is for the y would we have to put in what solved for in the explicit equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is absolutely yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not a complete solution to a problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We started with an implicit equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We differentiated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we got in the end, also an implicit equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't tell us what <EXPRESSION> is as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to go back to this formula to get the formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example, let me give you an example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this hides a degree of complexity of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's a degree of complexity that we must live with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example, at <EQUATION>, you can see that <EQUATION> solves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That happens to be-- solves <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why I picked the <EXPRESSION> actually, so it would be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just wanted to have a convenient solution there to pull out of my hat at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I did that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we now know that when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at (1, 1) along the curve, the slope = what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have to plug in here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "That's just plugging in that formula over there, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can get it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, at say <EQUATION>, we're stuck using this formula star here to find <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so let me just make two points about this, which are just philosophical points for you right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first is, when I promised you at the beginning of this class that we were going to be able to differentiate any function you know, I meant it very literally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I meant is if you know the function, we'll be able give a formula for the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't know how to find a function, you'll have a lot of trouble finding the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we didn't make any promises that if you can't find the function you will be able to find the derivative by some magic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will never happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And however complex the function is, a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients, we're stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the big advantage of his method, notice, is that although we've had to find star, we had to find this formula star, and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically, by the way, which we'll learn later, so there's a good method for doing it numerically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although we had to find star, we never had to differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We had a fast way of getting the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we had to know what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> we got by an algebraic formula, in terms of the values here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is very fast, forgetting the slope, once you know the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: What's in the parentheses?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Sorry, this is-- Well let's see if I can manage this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is this the parentheses you're talking about?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah, 'say'.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That says 'say'.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so maybe I should put commas around it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it was S A Y, comma comma, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well here was at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just throwing out a value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually there is one value, my favorite value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well this is easy to evaluate right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, I can do it there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's maybe the only one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The others are a nuisance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have to do something more here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this implicit differentiation method has one very, very important application to finding inverse functions, or finding derivatives of inverse functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's talk about that next.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first, maybe we'll just illustrate by an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have the function <EXPRESSION>, for <EXPRESSION> positive, then of course this idea is that we should simplify this equation and we should square it so we get this somewhat simpler equation here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 117}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 131}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 152}]}
{"text": "And then we have a notation for this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we call <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, this is the reversal of this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is that it should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in general, if we start with any old <EQUATION>, and we just write down, this is the defining relationship for a function <EXPRESSION>, the property that we're saying is that <EXPRESSION> has got to bring us back to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we write that in a couple of different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We call <EXPRESSION> the inverse of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also we call <EXPRESSION> the inverse of <EXPRESSION>, although I'm going to be silent about which variable I want to use, because people mix them up a little bit, as we'll be doing when we draw some pictures of this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's draw pictures of both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> on the same graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, I'm going to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "That's some shape like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, in order to understand what <EXPRESSION> is, so let's do the analysis in general, but then we'll draw it in this particular case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have <EQUATION>, that's really just the same equation right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the equation <EQUATION>, that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>, those are the same equations, it's the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But suppose now that we wanted to write down what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "In other words, we wanted to switch the variables, so draw them as I said on the same graph with the same <EXPRESSION>, and the same <EXPRESSION> axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then that would be, in effect, trading the roles of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to rename every point on the graph which is the ordered pair (x, y), and trade it for the opposite one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when you exchange <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so to do this, exchange <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and when you do that, graphically what that looks like is the following: suppose you have a place here, and this is the <EXPRESSION> and this is the <EXPRESSION>, then you want to trade them.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "So you want the y here right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's sort of the opposite place over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is the place which is directly opposite this point across the diagonal line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you reflect across this or you flip across that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get this other shape that looks like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll draw it with a colored piece of chalk here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this guy here is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, if you look at these graphs, this one is the square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one happens to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you take this one, and you turn it, you reverse the roles of the x axis and the y axis, and tilt it on its side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the picture of what an inverse function is, and now I want to show you that the method of implicit differentiation allows us to compute the derivatives of inverse functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just say it in general, and then I'll carry it out in particular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of any inverse function, provided we know the derivative of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that for what is an example, which is truly complicated and a little subtle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has a very pretty answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll carry out an example here, which is the function <EXPRESSION> is = the inverse tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, for the inverse tangent all of the things that we're going to do are going to be based on simplifying this equation by taking the tangent of both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, us let me remind you by the way, the inverse tangent is what's also known as arctangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just another notation for the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we're going to use to describe this function is the equation tan <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what happens when you take the tangent of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is how we're going to figure out what the function looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, I want to draw it, and then we'll do the computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make the diagram first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to do something which is analogous to what I did over here with the square root function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, I remind you that the tangent function is defined between two values here, which are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it starts out at minus infinity and curves up like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the one that we have to sketch is this one which we get by reflecting this across the axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well not the axis, the diagonal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This slope by the way, should be less - a little lower here so that we can have it going down and up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me show you what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the front, it's going to look a lot like this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one had curved down, and so the reflection across the diagonal curved up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here this is curving up, so the reflection is going to curve down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to look like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should, sorry, let's use a different color, because it's reversed from before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just call it green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the original curve in the first quadrant eventually had an asymptote which was straight up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one is going to have an asymptote which is horizontal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that level is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the highest?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now similarly, the other way, we're going to do this: and this bottom level is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the picture of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's defined for all <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this green guy is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's defined all the way from minus infinity to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to use a notation that we had from limit notation as x goes to infinity, let's say, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's an example of one value that's of interest in addition to the finite values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now the first ingredient that we're going to need, is we're going to need the derivative of the tangent function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to recall for you, and maybe you haven't worked this out yet, but I hope that many of you have, that if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 121, "end_offset": 156}]}
{"text": "So this you do by the quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is of the form <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You use the quotient rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So I'm going to get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what you get in the end is some marvelous simplification that comes out to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can recognize <EXPRESSION> from the fact that you should get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, and somehow the numerators all cancel and simplifies to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is also known as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that something that if you haven't done yet, you're going to have to do this as an exercise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need that ingredient, and now we're just going to differentiate our equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "And what do we get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get, again, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you like, <EXPRESSION> times, in the other notation, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've just used the formulas that I just wrote down there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now all I have to do is solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unfortunately, this is not the form that we ever want to leave these things in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the same problem we had with that ugly square root expression, or with any of the others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to rewrite in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Our original question was what is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now so far we have the following answer to that question: it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this is a correct answer, but way too complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now that doesn't mean that if you took a random collection of functions, you wouldn't end up with something this complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But these particular functions, these beautiful circular functions involved with trigonometry all have very nice formulas associated with them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this simplifies tremendously.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So one of the skills that you need to develop when you're dealing with trig functions is to simplify this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "And so let's see now that expressions like this all simplify.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's only one formula, one ingredient that we need to use to do this, and then we're going to draw a diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the ingredient again, is the original defining relationship that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> can be encoded in a right triangle in the following way: here's the right triangle and <EXPRESSION> means that <EXPRESSION> should be represented as an angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, its tangent is the ratio of this vertical to this horizontal side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm just going to pick two values that work, namely <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the simplest ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've encoded this equation in this picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now all I have to do is figure out what the <EXPRESSION> is in this right triangle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In order to do that, I need to figure out what the hypotenuse is, but that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can read off what the <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> divided by the hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> over square root, whoops, yeah, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so our answer over here, the preferred answer which is way simpler than what I wrote up there, is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll stop here for one more question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have one more calculation which I can do even in less than a minute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have a whole minute for questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: What happens to the inverse tangent?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The inverse tangent-- Okay, this inverse tangent is the same as this <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I did was I skipped this step here entirely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I never wrote that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the inverse tangent was that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The issue was what's a good formula for <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I am evaluating that, but I'm doing it using the letter <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, what happened to the inverse tangent is that I called it <EXPRESSION>, which is what it's been all along.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now I'm going to do the case of the <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll show you how easy this is if I don't fuss with-- because this one has an easy trig identity associated with it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, and now watch how simple it is when I do the differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just differentiate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "I get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, <EXPRESSION>, so that implies that = <EXPRESSION>, and now to rewrite that in terms of <EXPRESSION>, I have to just recognize that this is the same as this, which is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "So all told, the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these implicit differentiations are very convenient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, I warn you that you do have to be careful about the range of applicability of these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to draw a picture like this one to make sure you know where this makes sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, you have to pick a branch for the sine function to work that out, and there's something like that on your problem set.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's also discussed in your text.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll stop here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "- [Voiceover] Let's now introduce ourselves to the idea of a differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And as we'll see, differential equations are super useful for modeling and simulating phenomena and understanding how they operate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll get into that later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For now let's just think about or at least look at what a differential equation actually is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to write, so let's see here is an example of differential equation, if I were to write that the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of <EQUATION>, this right over here is a differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way we could write it if we said that <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, we could write this in function notation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 130}]}
{"text": "We could write the second derivative of our function with respect to <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of our function = <EXPRESSION> times our function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Or if we wanted to use the Leibniz notation, we could also write, the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All three of these equations are really representing the same thing, they're saying OK, can I find functions where the second derivative of the function plus <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of the function = <EXPRESSION> times the function itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just to be clear, these are all essentially saying the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you might have just caught from how I described it that the solution to a differential equation is a function, or a class of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not just a value or a set of values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the solution here, so the solution to a differential equation is a function, or a set of functions, or a class of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's important to contrast this relative to a traditional equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write that down.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So a traditional equation, maybe I shouldn't say traditional equation, differential equations have been around for a while.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write this as maybe an algebraic equation that you're familiar with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "An algebraic equation might look something like, and I'll just write up a simple quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solutions to this algebraic equation are going to be numbers, or a set of numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can solve this, it's going to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> could be = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> could be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solutions here are numbers, or a set of values that satisfy the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here it's a relationship between a function and its derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the solutions, or the solution, is going to be a function or a set of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's make that a little more tangible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What would a solution to something like any of these three, which really represent the same thing, what would a solution actually look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually let me move this over a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Move this over a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can take a look at what some of these solutions could look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me erase this a little.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "This little stuff that I have right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm just gonna give you examples of solutions here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll verify that these indeed are solutions for I guess this is really just one differential equation represented in different ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you'll hopefully appreciate what a solution to a differential equation looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that there is often more than one solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a whole class of functions that could be a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So one solution to this differential equation, and I'll just write it as our first one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So one solution, I'll call it y one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I could even write it as <EXPRESSION> to make it explicit that it is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "One solutions is <EQUATION> to the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I encourage you to pause this video right now and find the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and verify that it does indeed satisfy this differential equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's work through this together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>, so we just have to do the chain rule here, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 62}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "And the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we take the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>, this = the same exact idea, the derivative of this is <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "And now we could just substitute these values into the differential equation, or these expressions into the differential equation to verify that this is indeed going to be true for this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's verify that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we first have the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's that term right over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's going to be <EXPRESSION> times this right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be <EXPRESSION>, I'll just write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "Notice I just took this two times the first derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times the first derivative is going to be =, or needs to be =, if this indeed does satisfy, if <EXPRESSION> does indeed satisfy the differential equation, this needs to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if that indeed is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these <EXPRESSION> terms right over here, <EXPRESSION>, essentially <EXPRESSION>, that's gonna be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is indeed = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is indeed a solution to this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as we'll see, it is not the only solution to this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, let's say <EQUATION> is also a solution to this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I encourage you to pause the video again and verify that it's a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So assuming you've had a go at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first derivative of this is pretty straight-forward, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Second derivative, one of the profound things of the exponential function, the second derivative here is also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the second derivative, let me just do it in those same colors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the second derivative is going to be <EXPRESSION> is indeed going to be = to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is absolutely going to be true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is also a solution to this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a start.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the next few videos, we'll explore this more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll start to see what the solutions look like, what classes of solutions are, techniques for solving them, visualizing solutions to differential equations, and a whole toolkit for kind of digging in deeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: So, again welcome to 18.", "entities": []}
{"text": "01.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're getting started today with what we're calling Unit One, a highly imaginative title.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me first tell you, briefly, what's in store in the next couple of weeks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The main topic today is what is a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we're going to look at this from several different points of view, and the first one is the geometric interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we'll spend most of today on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we'll also talk about a physical interpretation of what a derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's going to be something else which I guess is maybe the reason why Calculus is so fundamental, and why we always start with it in most science and engineering schools, which is the importance of derivatives, of this, to all measurements.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means pretty much every place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means in science, in engineering, in economics, in political science, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Polling, lots of commercial applications, just about everything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's what we'll be getting started with, and then there's another thing that we're gonna do in this unit, which is we're going to explain how to differentiate anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how to differentiate any function you know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's kind of a tall order, but let me just give you an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want to take the derivative - this we'll see today is the notation for the derivative of something - of some messy function like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll work this out by the end of this unit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anything you can think of, anything you can write down, we can differentiate it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "All right, so that's what we're gonna do, and today, as I said, we're gonna spend most of our time on this geometric interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's begin with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go with the geometric interpretation of derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what we're going to do is just ask the geometric problem of finding the tangent line to some graph of some function at some point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is to say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the problem that we're addressing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so here's our problem, and now let me show you the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, well, let's graph the function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "Here's its graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's some point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, maybe I should draw it just a bit lower.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's above the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, by the way, this was supposed to be an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was some fixed place on the x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, in order to perform this mighty feat, I will use another color of chalk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about red?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the tangent line, well, not quite straight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Close enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the geometric problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I achieved what I wanted to do, and it's kind of an interesting question, which unfortunately I can't solve for you in this class, which is, how did I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, how physically did I manage to know what to do to draw this tangent line?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's what geometric problems are like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We visualize it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can figure it out somewhere in our brains.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the task that we have now is to figure out how to do it analytically, to do it in a way that a machine could just as well as I did in drawing this tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what did we learn in high school about what a tangent line is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, a tangent line has an equation, and any line through a point has the equation <EQUATION>, the slope, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the equation for that line, and now there are two pieces of information that we're going to need to work out what the line is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first one is the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's that point <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to specify <EXPRESSION>, given <EXPRESSION>, we need to know the level of <EXPRESSION>, which is of course just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not a calculus problem, but anyway that's a very important part of the process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the first thing we need to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the second thing we need to know is the slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's this number <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in calculus we have another name for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the calculus part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the tricky part, and that's the part that we have to discuss now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So just to make that explicit here, I'm going to make a definition, which is that <EXPRESSION> , which is known as the derivative, of <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>, is the slope of the tangent line to <EQUATION> at the point, let's just call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's what it is, but still I haven't made any progress in figuring out any better how I drew that line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to say something that's more concrete, because I want to be able to cook up what these numbers are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to figure out what this number <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one way of thinking about that, let me just try this, so I certainly am taking for granted that in sort of non-calculus part that I know what a line through a point is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I know this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But another possibility might be, this line here, how do I know - well, unfortunately, I didn't draw it quite straight, but there it is - how do I know that this orange line is not a tangent line, but this other line is a tangent line?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's actually not so obvious, but I'm gonna describe it a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not really the fact-- this thing crosses at some other place, which is this point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's not really the fact that the thing crosses at two place, because the line could be wiggly, the curve could be wiggly, and it could cross back and forth a number of times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not what distinguishes the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna have to somehow grasp this, and I'll first do it in language.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the following idea: it's that if you take this orange line, which is called a secant line, and you think of the point <EXPRESSION> as getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we draw it close enough, then that's gonna be the correct line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's really what I did, sort of in my brain when I drew that first line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's the way I'm going to articulate it first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, so the tangent line is = the limit of so called secant lines <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here we're thinking of P as being fixed and <EXPRESSION> as variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is still the geometric discussion, but now we're gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll be able to work out formulas in any example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, I'm gonna write out these points <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So maybe we'll put <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm thinking of this line through them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess it was orange, so we'll leave it as orange.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to compute its slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this, gradually, we'll do this in two steps.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus, including multi-variable calculus, across the board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first notation that's used is you imagine here's the x-axis underneath, and here's the <EXPRESSION>, the location directly below the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're traveling here a horizontal distance which is denoted by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>, so called.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we could also call it the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's one thing we want to measure in order to get the slope of this line <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other thing is this height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this distance here, which we denote <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "And then, the slope is just the ratio, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the slope of the secant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the process I just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself, but also in particular to its slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we write that is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And that's going to be our slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the slope of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, This is still a little general, and I want to work out a more usable form here, a better formula for this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to do that, I'm gonna write <EXPRESSION>, the numerator more explicitly here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "The change in f, so remember that the point <EXPRESSION> is the point (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, that's what we got for the formula for the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to compute these distances and in particular the vertical distance here, I'm gonna have to get a formula for <EXPRESSION> as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this horizontal distance is <EXPRESSION>, then this location is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the point above that point has a formula, which is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> of - and this is a mouthful - <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so there's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can write a different formula for the derivative, which is the following: so this <EXPRESSION> , which is the same as <EXPRESSION>, is going to be the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the change in <EXPRESSION>, well the change in <EXPRESSION> is the value of <EXPRESSION> at the upper point here, which is <EXPRESSION>, and minus its value at the lower point <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so this is the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to put this in a little box, because this is by far the most important formula today, which we use to derive pretty much everything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the way that we're going to be able to compute these numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This example, we'll call this example one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll take the function <EXPRESSION> , which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "That's sufficiently complicated to have an interesting answer, and sufficiently straightforward that we can compute the derivative fairly quickly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it that we're gonna do here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "All we're going to do is we're going to plug in this formula here for that function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's all we're going to do, and visually what we're accomplishing is somehow to take the hyperbola, and take a point on the hyperbola, and figure out some tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we're accomplishing when we do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're accomplishing this geometrically but we'll be doing it algebraically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first, we consider this difference <EXPRESSION> and write out its formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to have a place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna make it again above this point <EXPRESSION>, which is the general point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll make the general calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the value of <EXPRESSION> at the top, when we move to the right by <EXPRESSION>, so I just read off from this, read off from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The formula, the first thing I get here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the left hand term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's the right hand term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to divide that by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here's our expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And by the way this has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This thing is called a difference quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's pretty complicated, because there's always a difference in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in disguise, the denominator is a difference, because it's the difference between the value on the right side and the value on the left side here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now we're going to simplify it by some algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this =, let's continue on the next level here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I'm going to do is put it over a common denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the common denominator is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so in the numerator for the first expressions I have <EXPRESSION>, and for the second expression I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same thing as I had in the numerator before, factoring out this denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here I put that numerator into this more amenable form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there are two basic cancellations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first one is that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel, so we have this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the second step is that these two expressions cancel, the numerator and the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have a cancellation that we can make use of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll write that under here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the very last step is to take the limit as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, and now we can do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before we couldn't do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the numerator and the denominator gave us <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now that I've made this cancellation, I can pass to the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all that happens is I set this <EXPRESSION>, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So that's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so in other words what I've shown - let me put it up here - is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's look at the graph just a little bit to check this for plausibility, all right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's happening here is, first of all it's negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's less than <EXPRESSION>, which is a good thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You see that slope there is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the simplest check that you could make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the second thing that I would just like to point out is that as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, that as we go farther to the right, it gets less and less steep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, less and less steep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's also consistent here, when <EXPRESSION> is very large, this is a smaller and smaller number in magnitude, although it's always negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's always sloping down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so I've managed to fill the boards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I should stop for a question or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is to explain again this limiting process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the formula here is we have basically <EXPRESSION> numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, why is it that this expression, when <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> ?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me illustrate it by sticking in a number for <EXPRESSION> to make it more explicit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so for instance, let me stick in here for <EXPRESSION> the number <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the situation that we've got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the question is what happens as this number gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and gets to be practically <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, literally what we can do is just plug in <EXPRESSION> there, and you get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what I'm saying in general with this extra number here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is what happened between this step and this step, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Explain this step here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, so there were two parts to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first is this <EXPRESSION> which is sitting in the denominator, I factored all the way out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what's in the parentheses is supposed to be the same as what's in the numerator of this other expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, at the same time as doing that, I put that expression, which is the difference of two fractions, I expressed it with a common denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in the denominator here, you see the product of the denominators of the two fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I just figured out what the numerator had to be without really.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "Other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claim that on the whole, calculus gets a bad rap, that it's actually easier than most things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's a perception that it's harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I really have a duty to give you the calculus made harder story here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have to make things harder, because that's our job.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is actually what most people do in calculus, and it's the reason why calculus has a bad reputation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the secret is that when people ask problems in calculus, they generally ask them in context.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are many, many other things going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the little piece of the problem which is calculus is actually fairly routine and has to be isolated and gotten through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But all the rest of it, relies on everything else you learned in mathematics up to this stage, from grade school through high school.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the complication.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we're going to do a little bit of calculus made hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By talking about a word problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We only have one sort of word problem that we can pose, because all we've talked about is this geometry point of view.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far those are the only kinds of word problems we can pose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're gonna do is just pose such a problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So find the areas of triangles, enclosed by the axes and the tangent to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's a geometry problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me draw a picture of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's practically the same as the picture for example one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We only consider the first quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's our shape.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, it's the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's maybe one of our tangent lines, which is coming in like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we're trying to find this area here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, so there's our problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why does it have to do with calculus?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has to do with calculus because there's a tangent line in it, so we're gonna need to do some calculus to answer this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But as you'll see, the calculus is the easy part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's get started with this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, I'm gonna label a few things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one important thing to remember of course, is that the curve is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's perfectly reasonable to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And also, we're gonna calculate the areas of the triangles, and you could ask yourself, in terms of what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we're gonna have to pick a point and give it a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since we need a number, we're gonna have to do more than geometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna have to do some of this analysis just as we've done before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna pick a point and, consistent with the labeling we've done before, I'm gonna to call it (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's almost half the battle, having notations, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> for the variables, and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, for the specific point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, once you see that you have these labelings, I hope it's reasonable to do the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, and over here is the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's something that we're used to in graphs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to figure out the area of this triangle, it's pretty clear that we should find the base, which is that we should find this location here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we should find the height, so we need to find that value there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's go ahead and do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how are we going to do this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so let's just take a look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it that we need to do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim that there's only one calculus step, and I'm gonna put a star here for this tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to understand what the tangent line is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once I've figured out what the tangent line is, the rest of the problem is no longer calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just that slope that we need.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the formula for the tangent line?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put that over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "it's going to be <EXPRESSION> =, and here's the magic number, we already calculated it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's in the box over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the only bit of calculus in this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we're not done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to finish it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to figure out all the rest of these quantities so we can figure out the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, to find this point, this has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're gonna find the so called <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "That's the first thing we're going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to do that, what we need to do is to find where this horizontal line meets that diagonal line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the equation for the <EXPRESSION> is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we plug in <EQUATION>, that's this horizontal line, and we find this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that into star.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EXPRESSION> minus, oh one other thing we need to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , so this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's <EXPRESSION>, and here's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so in order to find this x value, I have to plug in one equation into the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this simplifies a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is plus <EXPRESSION> because the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel somewhat.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And so if I put this on the other side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I then multiply through - so that's what this implies - and if I multiply through by <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "OK, so I claim that this point we've just calculated, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm almost done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to get the other one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to get this one up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm gonna use a very big shortcut to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the shortcut to the y-intercept is to use symmetry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, I claim I can stare at this and I can look at that, and I know the formula for the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what that one is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason I know this is the following: so here's the symmetry of the situation, which is not completely direct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a kind of mirror symmetry around the diagonal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It involves the exchange of (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>) with (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>); so trading the roles of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the symmetry that I'm using is that any formula I get that involves <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, if I trade all the <EXPRESSION> and replace them by <EXPRESSION> and trade all the <EXPRESSION> and replace them by <EXPRESSION>, then I'll have a correct formula on the other way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 112}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 138, "end_offset": 145}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 171, "end_offset": 176}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 202, "end_offset": 209}]}
{"text": "So if everywhere I see a <EXPRESSION> I make it an <EXPRESSION>, and everywhere I see an <EXPRESSION> I make it a <EXPRESSION>, the switch will take place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just an accident of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because, so the symmetry explained.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that the equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's the same thing as <EQUATION>, if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's where the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> get reversed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK now if you don't trust this explanation, you can also get the y-intercept by plugging <EQUATION> into the equation star.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We plugged <EQUATION> in and we got the <EXPRESSION>-value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can do the same thing analogously the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right so I'm almost done with the geometry problem, and let's finish it off now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me hold off for one second before I finish it off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I'd like to say is just make one more tiny remark.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the hardest part of calculus in my opinion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the hardest part of calculus is that we call it one variable calculus, but we're perfectly happy to deal with <EXPRESSION> variables at a time or <EXPRESSION>, or any number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this problem, I had an <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>, an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's already <EXPRESSION> different things that have various relationships between them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course the manipulations we do with them are algebraic, and when we're doing the derivatives we just consider what's known as one variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really there are millions of variable floating around potentially.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what makes things complicated, and that's something that you have to get used to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now there's something else which is more subtle, and that I think many people who teach the subject or use the subject aren't aware, because they've already entered into the language and they're so comfortable with it that they don't even notice this confusion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's something deliberately sloppy about the way we deal with these variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason is very simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are already <EXPRESSION> variables here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't wanna create six names for variables or eight names for variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really in this problem there were about eight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just slipped them by you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So why is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well notice that the first time that I got a formula for <EXPRESSION> here, it was this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION>, which I plugged in right here, was from the equation of the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The second time I did it, I did not use <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used this equation here, so this is not <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the wrong thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an easy mistake to make if the formulas are all a blur to you and you're not paying attention to where they are on the diagram.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You see that x-intercept calculation there involved where this horizontal line met this diagonal line, and <EQUATION> represented this line here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the sloppiness is that <EXPRESSION> means two different things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we do this constantly because it's way, way more complicated not to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's much more convenient for us to allow ourselves the flexibility to change the role that this letter plays in the middle of a computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, later on, if I had done this by this more straightforward method, for the y-intercept, I would have set <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would have been this vertical line, which is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I didn't change the letter <EXPRESSION> when I did that, because that would be a waste for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is one of the main confusions that happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you can keep yourself straight, you're a lot better off, and as I say this is one of the complexities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so now let's finish off the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me finally get this area here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually I'll just finish it off right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area of the triangle is, well it's the base times the height.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The base is <EXPRESSION>, the height is <EXPRESSION>, and a half of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> , which is <EXPRESSION>, which is, lo and behold, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the amusing thing in this case is that it actually didn't matter what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get the same answer every time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just an accident of the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens to be the function with that property.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so we have some more business today, some serious business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me continue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first of all, I want to give you a few more notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are just other notations that people use to refer to derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the first one is the following: we already wrote <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so when we write <EXPRESSION>, that means the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That's a typical notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And previously we wrote <EXPRESSION> for the derivative, so this is Newton's notation for the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there are other notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one of them is <EXPRESSION>, and another one is <EXPRESSION>, meaning exactly the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And sometimes we let the function slip down below so that becomes <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are all notations that are used for the derivative, and these were initiated by Leibniz.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these notations are used interchangeably, sometimes practically together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They both turn out to be extremely useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one omits - notice that this thing omits - the underlying base point, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one of the nuisances.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't give you all the information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there are lots of situations like that where people leave out some of the important information, and you have to fill it in from context.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's another couple of notations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I have one more calculation for you today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I carried out this calculation of the derivative of the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanna take care of some other powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So Example <EXPRESSION> is going to be the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>; one of these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what we're trying to figure out is the derivative with respect to <EQUATION> in our new notation, what this =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, we're going to form this expression, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to make some algebraic simplification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we plug in for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "Now before, let me just stick this in then I'm gonna erase it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before, I wrote <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now I'm going to get rid of it, because in this particular calculation, it's a nuisance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have an <EXPRESSION> floating around, which means something different from the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I just don't wanna have to keep on writing all those symbols.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a waste of blackboard energy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a total amount of energy, and I've already filled up so many blackboards that, there's just a limited amount.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus, I'm trying to conserve chalk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, no <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So think of <EXPRESSION> as fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, <EXPRESSION> moves and <EXPRESSION> is fixed in this calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right now, in order to simplify this, in order to understand algebraically what's going on, I need to understand what the nth power of a sum is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's a famous formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We only need a little tiny bit of it, called the binomial theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the binomial theorem which is in your text and explained in an appendix, says that if you take the sum of two guys and you take them to the nth power, that of course is <EXPRESSION> multiplied by itself <EXPRESSION> times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the first term is <EXPRESSION>, that's when all of the <EXPRESSION> factors come in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you could have this factor of <EXPRESSION> and all the rest <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at least <EXPRESSION> term of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And how many times does that happen?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it happens when there's a factor from here, from the next factor, and so on, and so on, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a total of n possible times that that happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the great thing is that, with this alone, all the rest of the terms are junk that we won't have to worry about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to be more specific, there's a very careful notation for the junk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The junk is what's called <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What that means is that these are terms of order, so with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> or higher.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, that's how.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very exciting, higher order terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this is the only algebra that we need to do, and now we just need to combine it together to get our result.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now I'm going to just carry out the cancellations that we need.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION>, which remember was <EXPRESSION> times this, which is this times, now this is <EXPRESSION> this junk term, minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we have so far based on our previous calculations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to do the main cancellation, which is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION> plus this term here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And now I can divide in by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION> plus, now it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "There's at least one factor of <EXPRESSION> not two factors of <EXPRESSION>, because I have to cancel one of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I can just take the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the limit this term is gonna be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why I called it junk originally, because it disappears.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in math, junk is something that goes away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this tends to, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what I've shown you is that <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>-- sorry, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now this is gonna be super important to you right on your problem set in every possible way, and I want to tell you one thing, one way in which it's very important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One way that extends it immediately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this thing extends to polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get quite a lot out of this one calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if I take <EXPRESSION> of something like <EXPRESSION> that's gonna be = <EXPRESSION>, that's applying this rule to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then here, I'll get <EXPRESSION> so <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the type of thing that we get out of it, and we're gonna make more hay with that next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I turned myself off.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: The question was the binomial theorem only works when <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, the binomial theorem is a general formula which also specifies exactly what the junk is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's very much more detailed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we only needed this part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't care what all these crazy terms were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's junk for our purposes now, because we don't happen to need any more than those first two terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, because <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, see you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far we have learned about partial derivatives and how to use them to find minima and maxima of functions of two variables or several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we are going to try to study, in more detail, how functions of several variables behave, how to compete their variations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How to estimate the variation in arbitrary directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so for that we are going to need some more tools actually to study this things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "More tools to study functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today's topic is going to be differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, just to motivate that, let me remind you about one trick that you probably know from single variable calculus, namely implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that you have a function <EQUATION> then you would sometimes write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "And then maybe you would -- We use implicit differentiation to actually relate infinitesimal changes in y with infinitesimal changes in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one thing we can do with that, for example, is actually figure out the rate of change <EXPRESSION> by , but also the reciprocal <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, for example, let's say that we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then we can write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And, from there, we can actually find out what is the derivative of this function if we didn't know the answer already by writing <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That tells us that <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now <EXPRESSION> for relation to <EXPRESSION> is basically <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is how you find the formula for the derivative of the inverse sine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A formula that you probably already knew, but that is one way to derive it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we are going to use also these kinds of notations, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and so on, but use them for functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, we will have to learn what the rules of manipulation are and what we can do with them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The actual name of that is the total differential, as opposed to the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The total differential includes all of the various causes that can change -- Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the contributions that can cause the value of your function <EXPRESSION> to change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, let's say that you have a function maybe of three variables, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, then you would write <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 131}]}
{"text": "Maybe, just to remind you of the other notation, partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is this object?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What are the things on either side of this equality?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, they are called differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they are not numbers, they are not vectors, they are not matrices, they are a different kind of object.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These things have their own rules of manipulations, and we have to learn what we can do with them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do we think about them?", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, how do we not think about them?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is an important thing to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is not the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is meant to be a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is going to be a number once you have a small variation of <EXPRESSION>, a small variation of <EXPRESSION>, a small variation of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are actual numbers, and this becomes a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This guy actually is not a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You cannot give it a particular value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All you can do with a differential is express it in terms of other differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, this <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, well, they are mostly symbols out there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you want to think about them, they are the differentials of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, you can think of these differentials as placeholders where you will put other things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, they represent, you know, there is this idea of changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One way that one could explain it, and I don't really like it, is to say they represent infinitesimal changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another way to say it, and I think that is probably closer to the truth, is that these things are somehow placeholders to put values and get a tangent approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, if I do replace these symbols by <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> numbers then I will actually get a numerical quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that will be an approximation formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It will be the linear approximation, a tangent plane approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we can do -- Well, let me start first with maybe something even before that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first thing that it does is it can encode how changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> affect the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I would say that is the most general answer to what is this formula, what are these differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is a relation between <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a placeholder for small variations, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to get an approximation formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION> is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is getting cramped, but I am sure you know what is going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And observe how this one is actually = while that one is approximately =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they are really not the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another thing that the notation suggests we can do, and they claim we can do, is divide everything by some variable that everybody depends on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say, for example, that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> actually depend on some parameter <EXPRESSION> then they will vary, at a certain rate, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what the differential will tell us then is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>, when you plug in these values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, you will get <EXPRESSION> by dividing everything by <EXPRESSION> in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first thing we can do is divide by something like dt to get infinitesimal rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me just say rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that corresponds to the situation where <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means you can plug in these values into <EXPRESSION> to get, well, the value of <EXPRESSION> will depend on <EXPRESSION>, and then you can find the rate of change with <EXPRESSION> of a value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 148}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 167}]}
{"text": "These are the basic rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is known as the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "It is one instance of a chain rule, which tells you when you have a function that depends on something, and that something in turn depends on something else, how to find the rate of change of a function on the new variable in terms of the derivatives of a function and also the dependence between the various variables.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "Any questions so far?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A word of warming, in particular, about what I said up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is kind of unfortunate, but the textbook actually has a serious mistake on that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean they do have a couple of formulas where they mix a d with a delta, and I warn you not to do that, please.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean there are d's and there are delta's, and basically they don't live in the same world.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They don't see each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The textbook is lying to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first and the second claims, I don't really need to justify because the first one is just stating some general principle, but I am not making a precise mathematical claim.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The second one, well, we know the approximation formula already, so I don't need to justify it for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, on the other hand, this formula here, I mean, you probably have a right to expect some reason for why this works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is this valid?", "entities": []}
{"text": "After all, I first told you we have these new mysterious objects.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I am telling you we can do that, but I kind of pulled it out of my hat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean I don't have a hat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is this valid?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How can I get to this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is a first attempt of justifying how to get there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we said <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we know if <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we plug these into that formula, we will get that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I have a relation between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, I got <EXPRESSION> = sometimes times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> should be that coefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I divide by <EXPRESSION> then I get the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "That kind of works, but that shouldn't be completely satisfactory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that you are a true skeptic and you don't believe in differentials yet then it is maybe not very good that I actually used more of these differential notations in deriving the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is actually not how it is proved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The way in which you prove the chain rule is not this way because we shouldn't have too much trust in differentials just yet.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "I mean at the end of today's lecture, yes, probably we should believe in them, but so far we should be a little bit reluctant to believe these kind of strange objects telling us weird things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is a better way to think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One thing that we have trust in so far are approximation formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We should have trust in them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We should believe that if we change <EXPRESSION> a little bit, if we change <EXPRESSION> a little bit then we are actually going to get a change in <EXPRESSION> that is approximately given by these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is true for any changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, but in particular let's look at the changes that we get if we just take these formulas as function of time and change time a little bit by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will actually use the changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> in a small time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's divide everybody by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Here I am just dividing numbers so I am not actually playing any tricks on you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean we don't really know what it means to divide differentials, but dividing numbers is something we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I take <EXPRESSION> very small, this guy tends to the derivative, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Remember, the definition of <EXPRESSION> is the limit of this ratio when the time interval <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means if I choose smaller and smaller values of <EXPRESSION> then these ratios of numbers will actually tend to some value, and that value is the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, here <EXPRESSION>, when <EXPRESSION> is really small, will tend to the derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly for the others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means, in particular, we take the limit as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION> and we get <EXPRESSION> on one side and on the other side we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "And the approximation becomes better and better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember when we write approximately = that means it is not quite the same, but if we take smaller variations then actually we will end up with values that are closer and closer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When we take the limit, as <EXPRESSION>, eventually we get an equality.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean mathematicians have more complicated words to justify this statement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will spare them for now, and you will see them when you take analysis if you go in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions so far?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's check this with an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that we really don't have any faith in these things so let's try to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I give you a function that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that maybe <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does the chain rule say?", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Well, the chain rule tells us that <EXPRESSION> is, we start with <EXPRESSION>, well, what is that?", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION>, and maybe I should point out that this is <EXPRESSION> -- Well, <EXPRESSION>, which is going to be just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now let's plug in the actual values of these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so that will be <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the end of calculation we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is what the chain rule tells us.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "How else could we find that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we could just plug in values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, and take its derivative.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "Let's do that just for verification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It should be exactly the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, in this case, the two calculations are roughly = in complication.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But say that your function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> was much more complicated than that, or maybe you actually didn't know a formula for it, you only knew its partial derivatives, then you would need to use the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 222, "end_offset": 225}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 230, "end_offset": 240}]}
{"text": "So, sometimes plugging in values is easier but not always.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just check quickly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other method would be to substitute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, so you get <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, we know how to take the derivative using single variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we should know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we don't know then we should take a look at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The product rule that will be derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And that is the same answer as over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I ended up writing, you know, maybe I wrote slightly more here, but actually the amount of calculations really was pretty much the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What kind of object is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can think of <EXPRESSION> as just another variable that is given as a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, for example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would have a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> defined by this formula, and I call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I call its value <EXPRESSION> so that I can substitute <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "Well, let's think of <EXPRESSION> as a function of three variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, when I plug in the dependents of these three variables on <EXPRESSION>, then it becomes just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, really, my <EXPRESSION> here is pretty much what I called <EXPRESSION> before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is no major difference between the two.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is an application of what we have seen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that you want to understand actually all these rules about taking derivatives in single variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I showed you at the beginning, and then erased, basically justifies how to take the derivative of a reciprocal function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for that you didn't need multivariable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's try to justify the product rule, for example, for the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "An application of this actually is to justify the product and quotient rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's think, for example, of a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, that is just the product <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are actually functions of one variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, well, <EXPRESSION> is given by the chain rule applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now what is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is going to be just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get back the usual product rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "That is a slightly complicated way of deriving it, but that is a valid way of understanding how to take the derivative of a product by thinking of the product first as a function of variables, which are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then say, oh, but <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were actually functions of a variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you do the differentiation in two stages using the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, you can do the quotient rule just for practice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I give you the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right now I am thinking of it as a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> themselves are actually going to be functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, well, <EXPRESSION> is going to be partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How much is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How much is partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> -- Well, next we need to have partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we need to know how to differentiate the inverse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is actually the usual quotient rule just written in a slightly different way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, just in case you really want to see it, if you clear denominators for <EXPRESSION> then you will see basically <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's go to something even more crazy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim we can do chain rules with more variables.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "Let's say that I have a quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's call it <EXPRESSION> for now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I have quantity <EXPRESSION> as a function of say variables <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so in the previous setup <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depended on some parameters <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, actually, let's now look at the case where <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> themselves are functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say of two more variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am going to stay with these abstract letters, but if it bothers you, if it sounds completely unmotivated think about it maybe in terms of something you might now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say, polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say that I have a function but is defined in terms of the polar coordinate variables on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I know I want to switch to usual coordinates <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "Or, the other way around, I have a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and I want to express it in terms of the polar coordinates <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I would want to know maybe how the derivatives, with respect to the various sets of variables, related to each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One way I could do it is, of course, to say now if I plug the formula for <EXPRESSION> and the formula for <EXPRESSION> into the formula for <EXPRESSION> then <EXPRESSION> becomes a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and it can try to take partial derivatives.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "If I have explicit formulas, well, that could work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe the formulas are complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Typically, if I switch between rectangular and polar coordinates, there might be inverse trig, there might be maybe arctangent to express the polar angle in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I don't really want to actually substitute arctangents everywhere, maybe I would rather deal with the derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is what are partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> and partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> in terms of, let's see, what do we need to know to understand that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, probably we should know how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we don't know that then we are probably toast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>, partial  over partial <EXPRESSION> should be required.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What else should we know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it would probably help to know how <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we don't know that then we don't really know how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need also <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a lot of partials in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see how we can do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's start by writing <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is partial <EXPRESSION>, well, I don't know why I have two names, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are really the same thing here, but let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So far that is our new friend, the differential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what do we want to do with it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we would like to get rid of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> because we like to express things in terms of, you know, the question we are asking ourselves is let's say that I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit, how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, what happens, if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit, is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> will change.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"text": "How do they change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that is given to me by the differential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be, well, I can use the differential again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, again, taking the differential of a function of two variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that make sense?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we have the other guy, <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, similarly <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we have a relation between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We are expressing how <EXPRESSION> reacts to changes in <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which was our goal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's actually collect terms so that we see it a bit better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we have <EXPRESSION> = something <EXPRESSION> plus something <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the coefficient here has to be partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What else could it be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> if I forget what happens when I change <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the definition of a partial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, this one has to be partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is because it is the rate of change with respect to , if I keep <EXPRESSION> constant, so that these guys are completely ignored.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now you see how the total differential accounts for, somehow, all the partial derivatives that come as coefficients of the individual variables in these expressions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me maybe rewrite these formulas in a more visible way and then re-explain them to you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is the chain rule for this situation, with two intermediate variables and two variables that you express these in terms of.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "In our setting, we get partial <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the other one, the same thing with <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to explain various things about these formulas because they look complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, actually, they are not that complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A couple of things to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first thing, how do we remember a formula like that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to know how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what does <EXPRESSION> depend on?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we will put partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> and partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, why are they here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, they are here because they actually depend on <EXPRESSION> as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How does <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How does <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, the structure of this formula is simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To find the partial of f with respect to some new variable you use the partials with respect to the variables that <EXPRESSION> was initially defined in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you multiply them by the partials of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in terms of the new variable that you want to look at, <EXPRESSION> here, and you sum these things together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the structure of the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why does it work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me explain it to you in a slightly different language.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This asks us how does <EXPRESSION> change if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "Well, why would <EXPRESSION> change if <EXPRESSION> changes a little bit?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it would change because <EXPRESSION> actually depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I change <EXPRESSION>, how quickly does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I change <EXPRESSION> at this rate, how does that have to change?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION> times this guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, at the same time, <EXPRESSION> is also changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How fast is <EXPRESSION> changing if I change <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "Well, at the rate of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now if I change this how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "Well, the rate of change is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The product is the effect of how you change it, changing <EXPRESSION>, and therefore changing <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what happens in real life, if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "Well, both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> change at the same time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is the sum of the two effects.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does that make sense?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, if <EXPRESSION> depends on more variables then you just have more terms in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is another thing that may be a little bit confusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is tempting?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is tempting here would be to simplify these formulas by removing these partial x's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's simplify by partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Let's simplify by partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "We get partial <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something is not working properly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why doesn't it work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is precisely because these are partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are not total derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you cannot simplify them in that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is actually the reason why we use this <EXPRESSION> rather than a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "It is to remind us, beware, there are these simplifications that we can do with straight d's that are not legal here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somehow, when you have a partial derivative, you must resist the urge of simplifying things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No simplifications in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the simplest formula you can get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions at this point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When would you use this and what does it describe?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it is basically when you have a function given in terms of a certain set of variables because maybe there is a simply expression in terms of those variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But ultimately what you care about is not those variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but another set of variables, here <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are giving you a nice formula for <EXPRESSION>, but actually the relevant variables for your problem are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you know <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are related to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, of course, what you could do is plug the formulas the way that we did substituting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe that will give you very complicated expressions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe it is actually easier to just work with the derivates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The important claim here is basically we don't need to know the actual formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All we need to know are the rate of changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we know all these rates of change then we know how to take these derivatives without actually having to plug in values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, you could certain do the same things in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were functions of <EXPRESSION> instead of being functions of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> then it would be the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you would have the same formulas that I had, well, over there I still have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why does that one have straight d's?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the answer is I could put <EXPRESSION> if I wanted, but I end up with a function of a single variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a single variable then the partial, with respect to that variable, is the same thing as the usual derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't actually need to worry about curly in that case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that one is indeed special case of this one where instead of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depending on two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they depend on a single variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, of course, you can call variables any name you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just a slight generalization of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, not quite because here I also had a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, I am trying to just confuse you by giving you functions that depend on various numbers of variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have a function of 30 variables, things work the same way, just longer, and you are going to run out of letters in the alphabet before the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> themselves depended on another variable then you would continue with your chain rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe you would know to express partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> in terms using that chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are dependent on yet another variable then you could get the derivative with respect to that using first the chain rule to pass from <EXPRESSION> to that new variable, and then you would plug in these formulas for partials of f with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 152}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 160}]}
{"text": "In fact, if you have several substitutions to do, you can always arrange to use one chain rule at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just have to do them in sequence.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why we don't actually learn that, but you can just do it be repeating the process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, probably at that stage, the easiest to not get confused actually is to manipulate differentials because that is probably easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> does not exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> makes no sense by itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't exist alone.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What exists is only <EXPRESSION> some variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that accounts only for the rate of change with respect to that variable leaving the others fixed, while straight <EXPRESSION> is somehow a total variation of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It accounts for all of the partial derivatives and their combined effects.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any more questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just finish up very quickly by telling you again one example where completely you might want to do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have a function that you want to switch between rectangular and polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To make things a little bit concrete.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have polar coordinates that means in the plane, instead of using <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, you will use coordinates <EXPRESSION>, distance to the origin, and <EXPRESSION>, the angles from the x-axis.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 112, "end_offset": 115}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "The change of variables for that is <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that means if you have a function <EXPRESSION> that depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, in fact, you can plug these in as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 122}]}
{"text": "Then you can ask yourself, well, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is going to be, well, you want to take <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "That will end up being actually <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can do the same thing to find <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you can express derivatives either in terms of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> or in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> with simple relations between them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the one last thing I should say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On Thursday we will learn about more tricks we can play with variations of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one that is important, because you need to know it actually to do the p-set, is the gradient vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The gradient vector is simply a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You use this downward pointing triangle as the notation for the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is simply is a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, in a way, you can think of a differential as a way to package partial derivatives together into some weird object.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the gradient is also a way to package partials together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will see on Thursday what it is good for, but some of the problems on the p-set use it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have the differential equation <EXPRESSION> or the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we don't know how to find the solutions to this, but we at least want to get a sense of what the solutions might look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to do that what we could do is we could look at a coordinate plane, so let me draw some axes here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me draw relatively straight line alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's my y-axis and this is my x-axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me mark this as <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I could do is since this differential equation is just in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and first derivatives of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, I could sample points on the coordinate plane, I could look at the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> coordinates substitute them in here, figure out what the slope is going to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I could visualize the slope if a solution goes through that point what the slope needs to be there and I can visualize that with a line segment, a little small line segment that has the same slope as the slope in question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's actually do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me setup a little table here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do a little table here to do a bunch of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again I'm just sampling some points on the coordinate plane to be able to visualize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's say when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, what is the derivative of  with<EXPRESSION> respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION> so it's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so at the point <EXPRESSION> if a solution goes through this point its slope is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we can visualize that by doing a little horizontal line segment right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's keep going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well then <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at the point <EXPRESSION> if a solution goes through that point, it would have a slope of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I draw a little line segment that has a slope of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do this in a new color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well then it's <EXPRESSION>, so this is actually undefined, but it's a clue that maybe the slope there if you had a tangent line at that point, maybe it's vertical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll put that as a question mark, vertical there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe it's something like that if you actually did have, I guess it wouldn't be a function, if you had some kind of relation that went through it, but let's not draw that just yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's try some other points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try the point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we have <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well you'd have a slope of <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> you'd have a slope of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about if you had <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well now it's <EXPRESSION>, your slope is now <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, if a solution goes through this its slope would look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we could keep going, we could even do <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to have a slope of one as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you did <EXPRESSION>, that would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd have a slope of <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we could do a bunch of points, just keep going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm just doing them in my head, I'm not going on the table.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you get a sense of what's going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here you're slope, what if it was <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to have a slope of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at this point your slope <EXPRESSION> so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so you're going to have a slope like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At negative two two same exact idea, it would look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so when you keep drawing these line segments over these kind of sample points in the cartesian or in the x-y plane, you start to get a sense of well what would a solution have to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can start to visualize that hey maybe a solution would have to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This would be a solution, so maybe it would have to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if we're looking only at functions and not relations I'll make it so it's very clear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe it would have to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if the function started here based on what we've seen so far maybe it would have to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if this were a point on the function over here, it would have to do something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And once again I'm doing this based on what the slope field is telling me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this field that I'm creating where I'm sampling a bunch of points and I'm visualizing the slope with a line segement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once again this is called a slope field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So hopefully that gives you kind of the basic idea of what a slope field is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the next two videos we'll explore this idea even deeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "-- <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and -- okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here is a lecture on the applications of eigenvalues and, if I can -- so that will be Markov matrices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you what a Markov matrix is, so this matrix A will be a Markov matrix and I'll explain how they come in applications.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And -- and then if I have time, I would like to say a little bit about Fourier series, which is a fantastic application of the projection chapter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's a Markov matrix?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I just write down a typical Markov matrix, say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, let's say, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a -- a totally just invented Markov matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What makes it a Markov matrix?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Two properties that this -- this matrix has.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So two properties are -- <EXPRESSION>, every entry is greater = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All entries greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, when I square the matrix, the entries will still be greater/= <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to be interested in the powers of this matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this property, of course, is going to -- stay there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It -- really Markov matrices you'll see are connected to probability ideas and probabilities are never negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other property -- do you see the other property in there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I add down the columns, what answer do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all columns add to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All columns add to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually when I square the matrix, that will be true again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that the powers of my matrix are all Markov matrices, and I'm interested in, always, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this question of steady state will come up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You remember we had steady state for differential equations last time?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When -- what was the steady state -- what was the eigenvalue?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What was the eigenvalue in the differential equation case that led to a steady state?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When -- you remember that we did an example and one of the eigenvalues was <EQUATION>, and that -- so then we had an <EXPRESSION>, a constant <EXPRESSION> -- as time went on, there that thing stayed steady.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what -- in the powers case, it's not a <EXPRESSION> eigenvalue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually with powers of a matrix, a <EXPRESSION> eigenvalue, that part is going to die right away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> that's all important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this steady state will correspond -- will be totally connected with an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> and its eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, the steady state will be the eigenvector for that eigenvalue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what's coming.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, for some reason then that we have to see, this matrix has an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This property, that the columns all add to <EXPRESSION> -- turns out -- guarantees that <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue, so that you can actually find the eigenvalue -- find that eigenvalue of a Markov matrix without computing any determinants of <EXPRESSION> -- that matrix will have an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION>, and we want to see why.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other thing is -- so the key points -- let me -- let me write these underneath.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The key points are -- the key points are <EQUATION> is an eigenvalue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll add in a little -- an additional -- well, a thing about eigenvalues -- key point two, the other eigenval- values -- all other eigenvalues are, in magnitude, smaller than <EXPRESSION> -- in absolute value, smaller than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there could be some exceptional case when -- when an eigen -- another eigenvalue might have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It never has an eigenvalue larger than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these two facts -- somehow we ought to -- linear algebra ought to tell us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, of course, linear algebra is going to tell us what the -- what's -- what happens if I take -- if -- you remember when I solve -- when I multiply by <EXPRESSION> time after time the K-th thing is <EXPRESSION> and I'm asking what's special about this -- these powers of <EXPRESSION>, and very likely the quiz will have a problem to computer <EXPRESSION>- to computer some powers of <EXPRESSION> or -- or applied to an initial vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you remember the general form?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The general form is that there's some amount of the first eigenvalue to the K-th power times the first eigenvector, and another amount of the second eigenvalue to the K-th power times the second eigenvector and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A -- just -- my conscience always makes me say at least once per lecture that this requires a complete set of eigenvectors, otherwise we might not be able to expand u0 in the eigenvectors and we couldn't get started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But once we're started with <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then every <EXPRESSION> brings in these <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now you can see what the steady state is going to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> -- so <EQUATION> and these other eigenvalues are smaller than <EXPRESSION> -- so I've sort of scratched over the equation there to -- we had this term, but what happens to this term -- if the lambda's smaller than <EXPRESSION>, then the -- when -- as we take powers, as we iterate as we -- as we go forward in time, this goes to <EXPRESSION>, Can I just -- having scratched over it, I might as well scratch right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "further.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That term and all the other terms are going to <EXPRESSION> because all the other eigenvalues are smaller than <EXPRESSION> and the steady state that we're approaching is just -- whatever there was -- this was -- this was the -- this is the <EXPRESSION> part of un- of the initial condition <EXPRESSION> -- is the steady state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This much we know from general -- from -- you know, what we've already done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to see why -- let's at least see number <EXPRESSION>, why <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's actually -- in this chapter we're interested not only in eigenvalues, but also eigenvectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's something special about the eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write down what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The eigenvector <EXPRESSION> -- <EXPRESSION> is the eigenvector and all its components are positive, so the steady state is positive, if the start was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the start was -- so -- well, actually, in general, I -- this might have a -- might have some component <EXPRESSION> always, but no negative components in that eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I come to that point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How can I look at that matrix -- so that was just an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How could I be sure -- how can I see that a matrix -- if the columns add to <EXPRESSION> -- add to <EXPRESSION>, sorry -- if the columns add to <EXPRESSION>, this property means that <EQUATION> is an eigenvalue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just think that through.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I saying about -- let me ca- let me look at <EXPRESSION>, and if I believe that <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue, then I should be able to subtract off <EXPRESSION> times the identity and then I would get a matrix that's, what, -.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 149}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, -.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and -.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> -- wh- I took the <EXPRESSION> away and the other parts, of course, are still what they were, and this is still.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and -- okay, what's -- what's up with this matrix now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've shifted the matrix, this Markov matrix by <EXPRESSION>, by the identity, and what do I want to prove?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I -- what is it that I believe this matrix -- about this matrix?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I believe it's singular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Singular will -- if <EXPRESSION> is singular, that tells me that <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The eigenvalues are the numbers that I subtract off -- the shifts -- the numbers that I subtract from the diagonal -- to make it singular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now why is that matrix singular?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I -- we could compute its determinant, but we want to see a reason that would work for every Markov matrix not just this particular random example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it about that matrix?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I guess you could look at its columns now -- what do they add up to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The columns add to <EXPRESSION>, so all columns -- let me put all columns now of -- of -- of <EXPRESSION> add to <EXPRESSION>, and then I want to realize that this means <EXPRESSION> is singular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could I -- you know, that could be a quiz question, a sort of theoretical quiz question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I give you a matrix and I tell you all its columns add to <EXPRESSION>, give me a reason, because it is true, that the matrix is singular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess actually -- now what -- I think of -- you know, I'm thinking of <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> ways to see that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How would you do it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't want to take its determinant somehow.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the matrix to be singular, well, it means that these <EXPRESSION> columns are dependent, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The determinant will be <EXPRESSION> when those <EXPRESSION> columns are dependent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You see, we're -- we're at a point in this course, now, where we have several ways to look at an idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can take the determinant -- here we don't want to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "B- but we met singular before that -- those columns are dependent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do I see that those columns are dependent?", "entities": []}
{"text": "They all add to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Let's see, whew -- well, oh, actually, what -- another thing I know is that the -- I would like to be able to show is that the rows are dependent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe that's easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I know that all the columns add to <EXPRESSION>, that's my information, how do I see that those <EXPRESSION> rows are linearly dependent?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What -- what combination of those rows gives the <EXPRESSION> row?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How -- how could I combine those <EXPRESSION> rows -- those <EXPRESSION> row vectors to produce the <EXPRESSION> row vector?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And that would tell me those rows are dependent, therefore the columns are dependent, the matrix is singular, the determinant is <EXPRESSION> -- well, you see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just add the rows.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> times that row plus <EXPRESSION> times that row plus <EXPRESSION> times that row -- it's the <EXPRESSION> row.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rows are dependent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In a way, that <EXPRESSION>, because it's multiplying the rows, is like an eigenvector in the -- it's in the left null space, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is in the left null space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's singular because the rows are dependent -- and can I just keep the reasoning going?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this vector <EXPRESSION> is -- it's not in the null space of the matrix, but it's in the null space of the transpose -- is in the null space of the transpose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's good enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have a square matrix -- if we have a square matrix and the rows are dependent, that matrix is singular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it turned out that the immediate guy we could identify was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, the -- there will be somebody in the null space, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, who will it be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's -- so -- so now I want to ask about the null space of -- of the matrix itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What combination of the columns gives <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I -- I don't want to compute it because I just made up this matrix and -- it will -- it would take me a while -- it looks sort of doable because it's <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> but wh- my point is, what -- what vector is it if we -- once we've found it, what have we got that's in the -- in the null space of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the eigenvector, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's where we find <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then <EXPRESSION>, the eigenvector, is in the null space of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how we find eigenvectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So those <EXPRESSION> columns must be dependent -- some combination of columns -- of those <EXPRESSION> columns is the <EXPRESSION> column and that -- the <EXPRESSION> components in that combination are the eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that guy is the steady state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm happy about the -- the thinking here, but I haven't given -- I haven't completed it because I haven't found <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I -- another thought came to me as I was doing this, another little comment that -- you -- about eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What can you tell me about eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION> -- of <EXPRESSION> and eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're -- so this is a little comment -- we -- it's useful, since eigenvalues are generally not easy to find -- it's always useful to know some cases where you've got them, where -- and this is -- if you know the eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION>, then you know the eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION> are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And can I just, like, review why that is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to find the eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION>, this would be determinate of <EQUATION>, that gives me an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> -- now how can I get <EXPRESSION> into the picture here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll use the fact that the determinant of a matrix and the determinant of its transpose are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The determinant of a matrix = the determinant of a -- of the transpose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was property ten, the very last guy in our determinant list.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll transpose that matrix.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "This leads to -- I just take the matrix and transpose it, but now what do I get when I transpose <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "I just get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's -- that's all there was to the reasoning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reasoning is that the eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION> solved that equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The determinant of a matrix is the determinant of its transpose, so that gives me this equation and that tells me that the same lambdas are eigenvalues of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that, backing up to the Markov case, <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> transpose and we actually found its eigenvector, <EXPRESSION>, and that tell us that <EXPRESSION> is also an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> -- but, of course, it has a different eigenvector, the -- the left null space isn't the same as the null space and we would have to find it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's some vector here which is <EXPRESSION> that produces <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, it wouldn't be that hard to find, you know, I -- as I'm talking I'm thinking, okay, I going to follow through and actually find it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I can tell from this one -- look, if I put a point six there and a point seven there, that's what -- then I'll be okay in the last row, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I only -- remains to find one guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me take the first row, then.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> -- there's some big number going in there, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have -- just to make the first row come out <EXPRESSION>, I'm getting <EXPRESSION>, so that was <EXPRESSION> and what -- what do I want?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the first time in the history of linear algebra that an eigenvector has every had a component <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I guess it's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because then I multiply by <EXPRESSION> -- oh no, it was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So is this just -- oh, shoot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Only <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Only <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so there's the eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, and notice that it -- that it turned -- did turn out, at least, to be all positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that was, like, the theory -- predicts that part, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I won't give the proof of that part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> -- <EXPRESSION> -- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now those are the ma- that's the linear algebra part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I get to the applications?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where do these Markov matrices come from?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that's -- that's part of this course and absolutely part of this lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where's -- what's an application of Markov matrices?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Markov matrices -- so, my equation, then, that I'm solving and studying is this equation <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now <EXPRESSION> is a Markov matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A is Markov.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to give an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can I just create an example?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's one I've used before because it seems to me to bring out the idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's -- because we have <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, we have <EXPRESSION> states, let's say California and Massachusetts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm looking at the populations in those two states, the people in those two states, California and Massachusetts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my matrix A is going to tell me in a -- in a year, some movement has happened.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some people stayed in Massachusetts, some people moved to California, some smart people moved from California to Massachusetts, some people stayed in California and made a billion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that -- there's a matrix there with four entries and those tell me the fractions of my population -- so I'm making -- I'm going to use fractions, so they won't be negative, of course, because -- because only positive people are in- involved here -- and they'll add up to one, because I'm accounting for all people.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why I have these two key properties.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The entries are greater = <EXPRESSION> because I'm looking at probabilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do they move, do they stay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those probabilities are all between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the probabilities add to one because everybody's accounted for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not losing anybody, gaining anybody in this Markov chain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's -- it conserves the total population.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what would be a typical matrix, then?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this would be u, California and u Massachusetts at time <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's some matrix, which we'll think of, times <EXPRESSION> California and <EXPRESSION> Massachusetts at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice this matrix is going to stay the same, you know, forever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a severe limitation on the example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The example has a -- the same Markov matrix, the same probabilities act at every time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's a reasonable, say -- say point nine of the people in California at time <EXPRESSION> stay there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> of the people in California move to Massachusetts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice why that column added to <EXPRESSION>, because we've now accounted for all the people in California at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nine tenths of them are still in California, one tenth are here at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the people who are in Massachusetts?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is going to multiply column two, right, by our fundamental rule of multiplying matrix by vector, it's the -- it's the population in Massachusetts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Shall we say that -- that after the Red Sox, fail again, eight -- only <EXPRESSION> percent of the people in Massachusetts stay and <EXPRESSION> percent move to California.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, this adds to one, which accounts for all people in Massachusetts where they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there is a Markov matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Non-negative entries adding to one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the steady state?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If everybody started in Massachusetts, say, at -- you know, when the Pilgrims showed up or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then where are they now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where are they at time <EXPRESSION>, let's say, or maybe -- I don't know, how many years since the Pilgrims?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or -- and actually where will they be, like, way out a million years from now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I -- I could multiply -- take the powers of this matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, you'll -- you would -- ought to be able to figure out what is the hundredth power of that matrix?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why don't we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let me follow the steady state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what -- what's my starting -- my starting <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION> is, shall we say -- shall we put anybody in California?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's make -- let's make <EXPRESSION> there, and say the population of Massachusetts is -- let's say <EXPRESSION> just to -- okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the population is -- so the populations are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at the start.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What can you tell me about this population after -- after <EXPRESSION> steps?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What will <EXPRESSION> add to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those thousand people are always accounted for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But -- so <EXPRESSION> will start dropping from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> will start growing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, we could see -- why don't we figure out what it is after one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "After one time step, what are the populations at time one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens in one step?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You multiply once by that matrix and, let's see, <EXPRESSION> times this column -- so it's just <EXPRESSION> times this column, so I think we're getting <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So after the first step, <EXPRESSION> people have -- are in California.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now at the following step, I'll multiply again by this matrix -- more people will move to California.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Some people will move back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Twenty people will come back and, the -- the net result will be that the California population will be above <EXPRESSION> and the Massachusetts below <EXPRESSION> and they'll still add up to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do that a few times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do that <EXPRESSION> times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the population?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, okay, to answer any question like that, I need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "As soon as I've -- I've created an example, but as soon as I want to solve anything, I have to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and tell me its eigenvalues.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> = -- so tell me one eigenvalue?", "entities": []}
{"text": "One, thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And tell me the other one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the other eigenvalue -- from the trace or the determinant -- from the -- I -- the trace is what -- is, like, easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the trace of that matrix is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the other eigenvalue is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it -- notice that it's less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice that that determinant is <EXPRESSION>-.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is point <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now to find the eigenvectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is -- so that's <EXPRESSION> and the eigenvector -- I'll subtract <EXPRESSION> from the diagonal, right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "So can I do that in light let -- in light here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Subtract one from the diagonal, I have <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and of course these are still there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm looking for its -- here's -- here's -- this is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the null space of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, everybody sees that it's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now how about -- so that -- and it -- notice that that eigenvector is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, we can jump to infinity right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the population at infinity?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a multiple -- this is -- this eigenvector is giving the steady state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's some multiple of this, and how is that multiple decided?", "entities": []}
{"text": "By adding up to a thousand people.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the steady state, the <EXPRESSION> -- this is the <EXPRESSION>, but that adds up to <EXPRESSION>, so I really want two -- it's going to be <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, making a total of <EXPRESSION> people.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That'll be the steady state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's really all I need to know at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if I want to know what's happened after just a finite number like <EXPRESSION> steps, I'd better find this eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So can I -- can I look at -- I'll subtract <EXPRESSION> time -- ti- from the diagonal and I'll get that and I'll look at the null space of that one and I -- and this is going to give me <EXPRESSION>, now, and what is it?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "So what's in the null space of -- that's certainly singular, so I know my calculation is right, and -- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm prepared now to write down the solution after <EXPRESSION> time steps.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "The -- the populations after <EXPRESSION> time steps, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can -- can we remember the <EXPRESSION> -- the -- the one with this <EXPRESSION> eigenvector and the point <EXPRESSION> with the <EXPRESSION> eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll -- let me -- I'll just write it above here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> after <EXPRESSION> steps is some multiple of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> eigenvector and some multiple of point <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> eigenvector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's -- I -- this is how I take -- how powers of a matrix work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I apply those powers to a <EXPRESSION>, what I -- so it's <EXPRESSION>, which was <EXPRESSION> -- that has to be corrected <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So I'm plugging in <EQUATION> and I get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> equations, <EXPRESSION> constants, certainly independent eigenvectors, so there's a solution and you see what it is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, I guess we already figured that <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, I think -- did we think that had to be <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe <EXPRESSION> would be -- excuse me, let -- get an eraser -- we can -- I just -- I think we've -- get it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, we want to get a <EXPRESSION> here, so maybe we need plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that has to work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that'll give us the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> will give us <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what we approach -- this part, with the point k-th power is the part that's disappearing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's -- that's Markov matrices.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's an example of where they come from, from modeling movement of people with no gain or loss, with total -- total count conserved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I -- just if I can add one more comment, because you'll see Markov matrices in electrical engineering courses and often you'll see them -- sorry, here's my little comment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes -- in a lot of applications they prefer to work with row vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they -- instead of -- this was natural for us, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "For all the eigenvectors to be column vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our columns added to <EXPRESSION> in the Markov matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just so you don't think, well, what -- what's going on?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we work with row vectors and we multiply vector times matrix -- so we're multiplying from the left -- then it'll be the then we'll be using the transpose of -- of this matrix and it'll be the rows that add to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other textbooks, you'll see -- instead of col- columns adding to <EXPRESSION>, you'll see rows add to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, that's what I wanted to say about Markov, now I want to say something about projections and even leading in -- a little into Fourier series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because -- but before any Fourier stuff, let me make a comment about projections.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This -- so this is a comment about projections onto -- with an orthonormal basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, of course, the basis vectors are <EXPRESSION> up to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let -- let me imagine -- let me imagine this is a basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let -- let's say I'm in <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm -- I've got, eh, <EXPRESSION> orthonormal vectors, I'm in <EXPRESSION> dimensional space so they're a complete -- they're a basis -- any vector <EXPRESSION> could be expanded in this basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So any vector <EXPRESSION> is some combination, some amount of <EXPRESSION> plus some amount of <EXPRESSION> plus some amount of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- so any <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just want you to tell me what those amounts are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What are <EXPRESSION> -- what's <EXPRESSION>, for example?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm looking for the expansion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is -- this is really our projection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could -- I could really use the word expansion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm expanding the vector in the basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the special thing about the basis is that it's orthonormal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that should give me a special formula for the answer, for the coefficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how do I get <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What -- what's a formula for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could -- I can go through the projection -- the <EXPRESSION>, all that -- normal equations, but -- and I'll get -- I'll come out with this nice answer that I think I can see right away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How can I pick -- get a hold of <EXPRESSION> and get these other <EXPRESSION>-s out of the equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how can I get a nice, simple formula for <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we want to see, sure, we knew that all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The good way is take the inner product of everything with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "Take the inner product of that whole equation, every term, with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What will happen to that last term?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The inner product -- when -- if I take the dot product with <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "Because this basis was orthonormal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take the dot product with <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "If I take the dot product with <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So that tells me what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> transpose <EXPRESSION>, that's taking the dot product, is <EXPRESSION> plus a bunch of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And this is a one, so I can forget that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION> immediately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- do you see what I'm saying -- is that I have an orthonormal basis, then the coefficient that I need for each basis vector is a cinch to find.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me -- let me just -- I have to put this into matrix language, too, so you'll see it there also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I write that first equation in matrix language, what -- what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm writing -- in matrix language, this equation says I'm taking these columns -- are -- are you guys good at this now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm taking those columns times the <EXPRESSION> and getting <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the matrix form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, that's the matrix <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the solution to that equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's -- of course, it's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, but what's the point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in this case is going to -- is simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have to work to invert this matrix <EXPRESSION>, because of the fact that the -- these columns are orthonormal, I know the inverse to that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "And it is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you see a <EXPRESSION>, a square matrix with that letter <EXPRESSION>, the -- that just triggers -- <EXPRESSION> is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first component, then -- the first component of <EXPRESSION> is the first row times <EXPRESSION>, and what's that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first component of this answer is the first row of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just -- that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we concluded here, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- so nothing Fourier here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The -- the key ingredient here was that the <EXPRESSION>-s are orthonormal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now that's what Fourier series are built on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, in the remaining time, let me say something about Fourier series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So Fourier series is -- well, we've got a function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we want to write it as a combination of -- maybe it has a constant term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it has some <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it has some <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it has some <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a -- and some <EXPRESSION>, and forever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's -- what's the difference between this type problem and the one above it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one's infinite, but the key property of things being orthogonal is still true for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so it's the property that makes Fourier series work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's called a Fourier series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Better write his name up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fourier series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it was Joseph Fourier who realized that, hey, I could work in function space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of a vector <EXPRESSION>, I could have a function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead of orthogonal vectors, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> , <EXPRESSION>, I could have orthogonal functions, the constant, the <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>, but infinitely many of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need infinitely many, because my space is infinite dimensional.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is, like, the moment in which we leave finite dimensional vector spaces and go to infinite dimensional vector spaces and our basis -- so the vectors are now functions -- and of course, there are so many functions that it's -- that we've got an infin- infinite dimensional space -- and the basis vectors are functions, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, the constant function one -- so my basis is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason Fourier series is a success is that those are orthogonal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what do I mean by orthogonal?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know what it means for two vectors to be orthogonal -- <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Dot product = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "But what's the dot product of functions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm claiming that whatever it is, the dot product -- or we would more likely use the word inner product of, say, <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>, also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I -- let me tell you what I mean by that, by that dot product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, how do I compute a dot product?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "So, let's just remember for vectors <EXPRESSION> trans- <EXPRESSION> for vectors, so this was vectors, <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "+vnwn.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I have <EXPRESSION> functions, let's call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's with them now?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The vectors had n components, but the functions have a whole, like, continuum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To graph the function, I just don't have <EXPRESSION> points, I've got this whole graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have functions -- I'm really trying to ask you what's the inner product of this function <EXPRESSION> with another function <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to make it parallel to this the best I can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the best parallel is to multiply <EXPRESSION> at every <EXPRESSION> -- and here I just had n multiplications, but here I'm going to have a whole range of <EXPRESSION>-s, and here I added the results.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do I do here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the analog of addition when you have -- when you're in a continuum?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that the -- the dot product of <EXPRESSION> functions will be the integral of those functions, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I have to say -- say, well, what are the limits of integration?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for this Fourier series, this function <EXPRESSION> -- if I'm going to have -- if that right hand side is going to be <EXPRESSION>, that function that I'm seeing on the right, all those <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they're all periodic, with -- with period <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- so that's what <EXPRESSION> had better be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll integrate from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "My -- all -- everything -- is on the interval <EXPRESSION> now, because if I'm going to use these <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is periodic -- periodic functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I know what -- I've got all the right words now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got a vector space, but the vectors are functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got inner products and -- and the inner product gives a number, all right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just happens to be an integral instead of a sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got -- and that -- then I have the idea of orthogonality -- because, actually, just -- let's just check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Orthogonality -- if I take the integral -- s- I -- let me do <EXPRESSION> -- <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> -- I think we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the differential of that, so it would be <EXPRESSION>, was that right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> -- and, of course, we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the same would be true with a little more -- some trig identities to help us out -- of every other pair.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have now an orthonormal infinite basis for function space, and all we want to do is express a function in that basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I -- the end of my lecture is, okay, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the coefficient -- how much <EXPRESSION> is there in a function compared to the other harmonics?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How much constant is in that function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That'll -- that would be an easy question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer <EXPRESSION> will come out to be the average value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the amount of the constant that's in there, its average value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's take <EXPRESSION> as more typical.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "How will I get -- here's the end of the lecture, then -- how do I get <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first Fourier coefficient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do just as I did in the vector case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take the inner product of everything with <EXPRESSION> Take the inner product of everything with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "Then on the left -- on the left I have -- the inner product is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And on the right, what do I have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I -- so what I -- when I say take the inner product with <EXPRESSION>, let me put it in ordinary calculus words.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Multiply by <EXPRESSION> and integrate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "That's what inner products are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I multiply that whole thing by <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> integrate, I get a whole lot of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "The only thing that survives is that term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All the others disappear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- and that term is <EXPRESSION> times the integral of <EXPRESSION>", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: So we've been developing the procedure to describe a quantum gas of identical particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our non-interacting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what does that mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that we are thinking about the Hamiltonian for a system of <EXPRESSION> particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If they are not interacting, it can be written as the sum of the contributions for the individual particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if they are identical, it's basically the same particle for each one of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same Hamiltonian for each one of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we handle these?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you regard this as a quantum problem, for a single particle-- so for each one of these Hamiltonians-- we can find the eigenstates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a bunch of states that say label by <EXPRESSION> because we are ultimately have in mind the plane waves that describe gas particles in a box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there is corresponding energy levels for the single particles, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the single particle spectrum can therefore can be described by a bunch of energies, a lot of energy levels, with different values of <EXPRESSION> and different allowed discretized energies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, when we want to describe a case of <EXPRESSION> particles that are non-interacting, we said that we could, in principle, pick one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if we are dealing with bosons, potentially more than one at each side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the state would then be described by a bunch of occupation numbers <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> if you are talking about fermions, but any integer if you are talking about bosons.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> being plus or minus was used to distinguish appropriate symmetrization or anti-symmetrization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, once we have a state such as this, clearly the <EXPRESSION> particle hamintonium acting on a state that is symmetrized with these bunch of occupation numbers will give us back this state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The energy that we would be getting is summing over all possible <EXPRESSION> values, epsilon <EXPRESSION> times the number of occurrance of that in this state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, multiplying this state back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, we have a constraint that the number of particles matches the sum of the occupation numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then we said, OK, this is just a description of the state that they want to describe, or the set of states that represent this system of identical non-interacting partners in quantum mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next stage, we want to do some kind of first statistics for them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we had seen that basically, in order to assign appropriate statistics in case of quantum systems, we have to deal with a density matrix.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we saw that in the canonical representation, the density matrix is complicated and amounts to some kind of interaction among particles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although there is no interaction at this level, the symmetrization or anti-symmetrization create states that are intermixed in a manner that appears as if you have an interaction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We found that, however, we could get rid of that by going to the grand canonical ensemble where we would trade in the constraint that the number of particles is fixed with a chemical potential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in this ensemble, we found that the density matrix is diagonal in this representation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the diagonal elements can be thought of as the probability of one of these occupation number sets.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the probability of a particular set of occupations in this grand canonical prescription is proportional to e to the beta-- of course we have mu if we are going to this grand canonical ensemble-- <EXPRESSION>, and then we had <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the probability that a particular one of these is occupied <EXPRESSION> times in this grand canonical prescription is simply an exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, the different <EXPRESSION> levels are completely independent of each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the probability factor arises in this fashion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, as any probability, we have to normalize this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Normalization is appropriate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We call the grand canonical partition function and will be different whether we are dealing with boson statistics or fermion statistics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, because we have a structure such as this, Q is going to be the product of the normalization of each individual one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, <EXPRESSION> is going to be a sum of the contributions that I would get for the normalization of each individual ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course, the log of whatever normalization I have for the individual one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I have the case of a fermions where <EXPRESSION> gets <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> as the two possibilities, then the normalization will be simply <EXPRESSION> plus this exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I choose to write that as <EXPRESSION> where I have introduced <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Because this combination occurs all the time, I don't want to keep repeating that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this was for the case of fermions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the case of bosons where <EXPRESSION> goes <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, et cetera, this is a geometric series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the geometric series, when I sum it, I would get <EXPRESSION> over this factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I take the log I will have a minus sign here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And I can put the Boson and Fermi cases together by simply putting a factor of <EXPRESSION> here so that I have the plus for the case of fermions and the minus for the case of bosons.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is one thing that we will be using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other thing is that this is the probability for this level having a certain occupation number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In k we can always ask, what is the average of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "And from this probability it is easy to calculate the average.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer, again, can be collapsed into one expression for the case of bosons and fermions as <EXPRESSION> encompassing both fermions and bosons.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these results give some idea both at the microscopic level-- in terms of occupation numbers of these different levels-- and macroscopic level a grand partition function from which we can construct thermodynamics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, full probability, again, in this ensemble which we can transform in principle and get density matrices, et cetera, in other basis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But these are the kinds of things that we can do for any interacting Hamiltonian.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what I said over here was that I'm actually interested in the case of a gas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's again think about the type of gas such as the one in this room that we are interested.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, to make a contrast with something that we may want to do later, let's emphasize that it is a non-relativistic gas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the Hamiltonian <EXPRESSION> is essentially free particle in a box of volume <EXPRESSION>, the thing that we have been using all the time, just the kinetic energy of a one particle state.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for that we know that the single particle energy levels are characterized by a vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As three components, in fact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we've discussed what the discretization of <EXPRESSION> is appropriate to the size of the box.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We won't go over that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, maybe it is important to mention that because of the discretizatoin of the <EXPRESSION> values, the spacing between possible values of <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION> in each direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And ultimately what we want to do is to replace these sums over <EXPRESSION> in the limit of large boxes with integrals over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "So these go over to an integral over <EXPRESSION> times the density factor that you get in going from the sum to the integral, which is <EXPRESSION> times the volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will introduce one other factor here, which is that when we are talking about quantum particles and bosons and fermions, they are typically assigned also another state-- another parameter-- that characterizes their spin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And depending on the possible values of spin, you will have <EXPRESSION> copies of the system.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this <EXPRESSION> will be related to the quantum spin-- to the formula <EXPRESSION>-- so that when you have fermions, typically <EXPRESSION> is half integer and this will be an even number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whereas for bosons it will be an odd number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's, again, something that we've seen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You just, essentially says multiply everything by some factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if I go through this procedure that I have outlined here, I will ultimately get the grand partition function of the gas-- which as we will see is related to its pressure-- in terms of the chemical potential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Throughout the course we've seen that the more interesting thing to look at is how things depend on density rather than chemical potential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'd better use this result to get what the density is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, once I have determined what the chemical potential is, the average number of particles will be the sum over and the average occupation numbers that I have in all of these states.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And according to the prescription that we have over here, in the limit of a large box, this sum over <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ultimately I will divide by <EXPRESSION> so I will have the formula for the density.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have the formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and then I have a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I divide through by <EXPRESSION>, really I will have the density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Get rid of this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have to do that integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now for this and a lot of other things, you can see that always I will have sums or integrations over the combination that appears in the exponent and enhances dimension list which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me introduce a new variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me call <EXPRESSION> to be the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So I'm going to call this <EXPRESSION>, if you like.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So I have changed variables from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION> is simply <EXPRESSION>-- which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I took a square root so it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I realize that <EXPRESSION> is in fact <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> I can put in the numerator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "And then I remember that actually the combination <EXPRESSION>, I was calling these thermal wavelength <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> should have the dimensions of an inverse landscape, so that's the appropriate thing to choose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take <EXPRESSION> inside and I'm left with <EXPRESSION> divided by this parameter <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "Again, for later clarity, let's make sure we remember this was our <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the variable <EXPRESSION> that I need.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, for the-- for the integration I have to also make a change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I not that <EXPRESSION>, if I take a derivative here, I will get <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "Actually, the factor that I need over here is <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now everything only depends on the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will take advantage of spherical symmetry, write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "And then I substitute from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> above in terms of this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So I will have a <EXPRESSION> from this division.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is simply <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see lots of things cancel out and the answer is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is left from all of these <EXPRESSION> et cetera, is a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or <EXPRESSION> in the numerator or <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I do these set of changes that I have on the right part of the board, what do I have for density?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The density becomes simply <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have this integral over <EXPRESSION> that I have recast as an integral that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me pull out the factor of <EXPRESSION> on the outside.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will pull out to that factor of <EXPRESSION> that I had before.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And then I have the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me write it in this fashion.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the denominator, what do I have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> universe into the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we did all of these and we ended up with an integral that we don't recognize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we are going to do is to pretend that we recognize it and give it a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we define a set of functions <EXPRESSION> of variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once I do the integration over <EXPRESSION>, I will get a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So that function of <EXPRESSION> I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "But clearly I have a different <EXPRESSION> if I have <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> for bosons of fermions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there is two classes of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I had the integral <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out that you will get a whole bunch of these integrals where the [INAUDIBLE] that is out front in the numerator is different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will generalize this <EXPRESSION>, this <EXPRESSION> to something that I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if these normalized so that what is in front is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are very important functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everything we will do later on we will be expressing in terms of these functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, clearly what is happening here corresponds to <EXPRESSION> being = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> being <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is this normalization?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, for the normalization, if this is <EXPRESSION> I would need <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you go and look at the various definitions that we have for the gamma function or the factorial, you can check that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, indeed, we saw this already when we wrote the expression for the surface area in general dimensions that involved factorial function appearing as fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in order to get the right result in two or three dimensions, you can check that this <EXPRESSION> is correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, indeed, I already have this <EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was properly normalized.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the whole thing here can be written as <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the expression that relates the density to the chemical potential or this communication <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> or the fugacity is simply this nice formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what we want is to calculate something like the pressure for the gas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me remind you that <EXPRESSION>, essentially, quite generally, <EXPRESSION> comes from normalizing something that is like mu times the total number of particles minus the energy-- you can kind of read that from here-- and then there would be <EXPRESSION> from the number of states.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was the general formula that we had.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when we substitute for a system that is extensive, where <EXPRESSION> for a gas is <EXPRESSION>, we see that the <EXPRESSION> of the partition function is simply the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Of course, again, this pressure as a function of density or chemical potential would be different whether we are thinking about bosons of fermions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it can be calculated from the kind of sum that we have over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION> which is something like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is obtained by doing this sum over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will get-- first of all, I have the <EXPRESSION> [INAUDIBLE] with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The volume factor cancels because I divided by volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION>-- again, <EXPRESSION>-- are the energy that I'm dealing with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do we do with this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We make the same change of variables that we have over here from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then I would have <EXPRESSION> gets replaced with this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have the integral <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Huh.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It seems like-- yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: What happened to your factor <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anything else?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I was hoping to have integrals that are all expressible in terms of this-- these set of functions that I defined.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> does not fall into this category.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Should I define something else?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the answer is no because I can make that integral look like this by simbly doing an integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we do integrate by parts in which case what I do is I take a derivative of this and I take an integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 93}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "Integral of <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is, of course, a minus sign involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this minus becomes plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make sure I have the <EXPRESSION> this time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> became <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> I will bring out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have to take the derivative of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the argument of the <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this minus becomes plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's arrange things a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can get rid of these etas because eta squared will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is the answer, therefore?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION>, and I multiply <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION>, what I will get is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what do I have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, divide the numerator and denominator by <EXPRESSION> and you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "And lo and behold, we have a function of the variety that we had defined on the board corresponding to <EXPRESSION> being <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> being <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we have here is that <EXPRESSION>, depending on whatever statistics we are dealing with, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what you have to do is always ensure what is happening to the boundary terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Boundary terms will be a product of <EXPRESSION> and this factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> will ensure that you are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, the exponential will ensure that you're to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the boundary terms are important and indeed you have to check them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can check that they are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: I think the factor that multiples <EXPRESSION> is [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's-- the argument still holds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: The argument still holds because as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, you can ask, how does it go to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes to <EXPRESSION> exponentially.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exponentially it will [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you for the correction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's one other thing that we can take a look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The total energy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the energy in each one of these states is given by that formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I ask, what is the total expectation value of energy?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, in thermodynamics we expect the extensive quantities such as the energy should have, in an aerodynamic sense, well defined values so I won't write the expectation value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is going to be a sum over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this will depend on the statistics that I'm looking at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I will have is that this will go over to an integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have epsilon of <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The expectation value of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>-- sorry-- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the simplest way to do this is to first of all divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can define an energy density.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "Actually, since I'm going to change variables to this combination that is <EXPRESSION>, I notice that up to a factor of betas the numerator is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me actually calculate the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "That only depends on this combination <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is g-- the integral over <EXPRESSION>, I know how to replace it with something that involves <EXPRESSION>-- is going to give me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Integral <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From the change of variables, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I introduced one factor of <EXPRESSION> here because I have this energy factor in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that changes this to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then again, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if is one of the integrals that we have defined.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it is exactly what I have above for the pressure, except that I don't have the factor of <EXPRESSION> that appeared nicely to give the right normalization.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I conclude is that this quantity is in fact <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But they are exactly the same functions for energy and pressure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that, irrespective of what the chemical potential is doing, I can state that for the quantum system <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, we have seen this expression classically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what happens quantum mechanically is that the pressure starts to vary in some complicated way with density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what we learn is that energy will also vary in the same complicated way with density, such that always this formula <EXPRESSION> is valid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is some nice symmetry reason for why that is the case that you explore in one of the problems that you will see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the characteristics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In some sense we have solved the problem because we know both density and pressure in terms of chemical potential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all we need to do is to invert this, get the chemical potential as a function of density, insert it in the formula for pressure and we have pressure as a function of density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But since these are kind of implicit through these f functions, we don't quite know what that means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next stage is to really study how these f functions behave and how we can relate their behaviors to dependence on density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will see that we have to distinguish between low density and high density regimes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does it mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can see that both have players on the right hand side is dimensionless.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only dimension full combination that we have here is <EXPRESSION>-- well, we can make it dimensionless by multiplying by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it turns out that whether or not you see things that are classical or things that are very quantum mechanical depend on this degeneracy factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which, within our context of statistical physics of gases, we define to be the communication <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will regain classical behaviors when degeneracy is small, density is small enough such that <EXPRESSION> is much less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will see totally new behavior that is appropriate to quantum mechanics in other limit where [?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> ?", "entities": []}
{"text": "] becomes large.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this distinguishes classical versus quantum behavior.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we expect to regain classical behavior in the limit of very low densities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we've been kind of saying from the very first lecture that low density gas has this ideal behavior where <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, therefore, let's focus on the limit where <EXPRESSION> is much less than <EXPRESSION>, which is classical.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, we need the behavior of the function when it is small-- and I'll show you [INAUDIBLE] consistently that the function is small when it's argument is small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll see that <EXPRESSION> less than <EXPRESSION> implies or is implied by <EXPRESSION> being less than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take a look at one of these functions, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'd like to explore the limit of this when <EXPRESSION> is small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's currently not very good because I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I will do is I will multiply by <EXPRESSION> both numerator and denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I will have <EXPRESSION> integral <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have-- oops, there was an <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I say, well, the thing that is appearing in the denominator, I can write as a sum of a geometric series in powers of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's, after all, what I'm attempting to do, make an expansion in powers of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It starts with <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> I can write as the sum alpha going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "This geometric series sums to what I have over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's rearrange this a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will take the sum over alpha outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I notice that actually I have here, this first term, which is different from this by a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me multiply by an <EXPRESSION> and get another <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have a sum that starts from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have one other <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have the integration over <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I didn't write <EXPRESSION> because I pulled it out the integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will write it now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I didn't write <EXPRESSION> factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, once more, this is an integration that you have seen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The result of doing integral <EXPRESSION> is simply <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except that it is not <EXPRESSION> but it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can rescale everything by <EXPRESSION> and I will pull out a factor of <EXPRESSION> to there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do we have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have that <EXPRESSION> [?", "entities": []}
{"text": "power series ?", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "] representation, <EXPRESSION> running from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an alternating series that starts with plus and then becomes a minus, et cetera.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I were to explicitly write this, you will see how nice it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you can see why it is such a nice thing that really deserves to have a function named after it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we call that nice series [?", "entities": []}
{"text": "to Vf.", "entities": []}
{"text": "?", "entities": []}
{"text": "] Now, for future reference, note the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take a derivative of this function with respect to <EXPRESSION>-- its argument-- then in this power series, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> will cancel one of the <EXPRESSION> that I have here and it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that the coefficients that were powers of m become powers of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Numerator has gone down by one factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the numerator is now what it was before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The denominators, rather than being raised to the power of <EXPRESSION>, are raised to the power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So clearly, this is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So basically these functions have this nice character that they are like a ladder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You take a derivative of one and you get the one that is indexed by one less.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: Is there a factor of eta that comes out to be [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: In the derivatives?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: I mean, it seems to me that there's an eta-- like, in that relation that-- PROFESSOR: In this relation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it by step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take a derivative, divide <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "Then I multiply by <EXPRESSION>, this becomes <EXPRESSION>, this becomes <EXPRESSION>, this becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And you can see that the etas are exactly where they should be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: Would you explain why the index of summation starts from-- PROFESSOR: One?", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: --one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take a look at this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see there is a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I made it into a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that if <EXPRESSION> is very small, if will start with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what happened here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wrote this as a sum of geometric series.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I pulled out this factor of <EXPRESSION> that was in the numerator, and the denominator I wrote as a series that starts with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then there is this <EXPRESSION> out front.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I pulled this <EXPRESSION> in front here and then it starts with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could have written it-- I can put this in here and write it as <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> starting from <EXPRESSION>, et cetera.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "Or I can write it [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Or, alternatively, you can say, let's put the <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "And then I see that this is the geometric series where the first term is this <EXPRESSION> [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to erase this board but keep this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me erase it and then rewrite it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "So this I will rewrite as <EXPRESSION>, which is my degeneracy factor, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And in the limit where <EXPRESSION> goes to small, I can use the expansion that I just derived, which is <EXPRESSION> to the-- what is it-- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can see that precisely because as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, this series goes to <EXPRESSION>, that smallness of <EXPRESSION> is the same thing or implied by the smallness of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION> only at the lowest order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens at higher orders, <EXPRESSION>-- inverting this-- is <EXPRESSION>, and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we saw this when I was doing the calculation for the interacting gas, that clearly to lowest order <EQUATION>, if I want to get the next order, I substitute the result of the previous order into this expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> I substitute for <EXPRESSION>, I will <EXPRESSION> as the first contribution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And then something that is order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I want the answer to the <EXPRESSION> order, I take this whole thing that is that order of <EXPRESSION> and substitute in this series.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "And so what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will get <EXPRESSION>-- which is the square of this quantity-- square of this quantity is <EXPRESSION> minus twice the product of these two terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have twice <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then square of this term, but that's order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't care for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have, from here, plus <EXPRESSION> ignoring terms of the order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] <EQUATION> [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: Ah, great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Saves me having to go back later when the answer doesn't match.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let's organize terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The lowest order I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At order of <EXPRESSION> I have still just this one term, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We knew that was the correct result at order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At order of <EXPRESSION> I have two terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is the product of these two terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> disappear, <EXPRESSION>, and this will give me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And from other part, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I haven't calculate things at order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have calculated in a power series that we can go to whatever order you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> which is related to chemical potential as a function of this degeneracy that is simply related to density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the formula for the pressure is up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So reorganizing this a little bit, the dimensionless form is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> we can make an expansion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION> and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For <EXPRESSION> I substitute from the line above.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the first term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to square what is up here and here keeping terms to order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So what do I have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> from squaring this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a term that is twice the product of these two terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the only term that is order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I haven't calculated anything at all of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can see that everything is going to be proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's put out the factor of <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "So this is just one factor of <EXPRESSION> that I have pulled out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that then I start with <EXPRESSION>, and then the next correction I have an <EXPRESSION> here, <EXPRESSION> here with opposite sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is twice bigger than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the sum total of them would be <EXPRESSION>-- one factor of <EXPRESSION> I have out front-- the other factor I will write here and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 124}]}
{"text": "And then at order of <EXPRESSION>, I have a bunch of terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a <EXPRESSION> here, and from the product of these terms, I will have <EXPRESSION> disappear, I have <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the product of these things will give me a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> I will get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we have <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is three times larger than this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Subtract one of them, I will be left <EXPRESSION> [?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> ?", "entities": []}
{"text": "] <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you can see that the form that we have is <EXPRESSION>-- the pressure-- starts with density.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I essentially divide it through by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "I start with the ideal gas result, <EXPRESSION>, and then I have a correction that is order of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "In view up our [INAUDIBLE] co-efficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we see that our <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times-- sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember that <EXPRESSION>, et cetera, had dimensions of volume.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if the volume is provided by <EXPRESSION>, it is an additional factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For fermions it's a positive pressure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the pressure goes up because fermions repel each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For bosons it is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Bosons attract each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "The task for today is to find particular solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me remind you where we've gotten to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're talking about the second-order equation with constant coefficients, which you can think of as modeling springs, or simple electrical circuits.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what's different now is that the right-hand side is an input which is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we are considering, I'm going to use <EXPRESSION> as your book does, keeping to a neutral letter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, again, in the applications, and in many of the applications at any rate, it wants to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I make it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So, the independent variable is <EXPRESSION>, and the problem is, remember, that to find a particular solution, and the reason why we want to do that is then the general solution will be of the form <EXPRESSION> = that particular solution plus the complementary solution, the general solution to the reduced equation, which we can write this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, all the work depends upon finding out what that <EXPRESSION> is, and that's what we're going to talk about today, or rather, talk about for two weeks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the point is, not all functions that you could write on the right-hand side are equally interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's one kind, which is far more interesting, but more important in the applications than all the others.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's the one out of which, in fact, as you will see later on this week and into next week, an arbitrary function can be built out of these simple functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the important function is on the right-hand side to be able to solve it when it's a simple exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if you allow me to make it a complex exponential, so, here are the important right-hand sides where we want, we want to be able to do it when it's of the form, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In general, that will be, in most applications, a is not a growing exponential, but a decaying exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, typically, <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it doesn't have to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll put it in parentheses, though, often.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "That's not any assumption that I'm going to make today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just culture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, we want to be able to do it for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, when the right-hand side is a pure oscillation, that's another important type of input both for electrical circuits, think alternating current, or the spring systems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a pure vibration is you're imposing pure vibration on the spring-mass-dashpot system, and you want to see how it responds to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, you could put them together, and make these decaying oscillations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we could also have something like e to the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the point is, all of these together are really just special cases of one general thing, exponential, if you allow the exponent not to be a real number, but to be a complex number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, they're all special cases of e to the, I'll write it <EXPRESSION>, well, why don't we write it <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then I've got this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, I got this case separating into its real and imaginary parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if neither is <EXPRESSION>, I have this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I don't want to keep writing <EXPRESSION> all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to write that simply as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And, you understand that <EXPRESSION> is a complex number now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't look like a real number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so the complex number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the equation we are solving is which one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This pretty purple equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we are trying to find a particular solution of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the special functions we are going to use are these, well, this one in particular, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be our input.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it turns out this is amazingly easy to do because it's an exponential because I write it in exponential form.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "The idea is simply to use a rule which, in fact, you know already, the rule of substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to write the equation in the form, so, there it is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I'm going to think of the left-hand side as the polynomial operator, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are constants, applied to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the way I write the thing.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And, this part, I'm going to think of in the form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, a polynomial in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it's a simple quadratic polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, most of what I'm going to say today would apply equally well if we were a higher order polynomial, a polynomial of higher degree.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, just to reinforce the idea, I've given you one problem in your problem set when <EXPRESSION> is a polynomial of higher degree.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should say, the notes are written for general polynomials, not just for quadratic ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm simplifying it by leaving it, today, I'll do what's in the notes, but I'll do it in the quadratic case to save a little time, and because that's the one you will be most concerned with in the problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, there are just a couple of basic formulas that we're going to use all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first is that if you apply <EXPRESSION> to a complex exponential, or a real one, it doesn't matter, the answer is you get just what you started with, with <EXPRESSION> substituted by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, put an alpha wherever you saw a <EXPRESSION> in the polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what is this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is now just an ordinary complex number, and multiply that by what you started with, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's a basic formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called in the notes the substitution rule because the heart of it is, you substitute for the <EXPRESSION>, you substitute <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 89}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "Now, this hardly requires proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's prove it just so you see, to reinforce things and make things go a little more slowly to make sure you are on board all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How would I prove that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, just calculate it out, what in fact is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's <EXPRESSION> by linearity plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "Well, what are these?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's a second derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you remember from the exam, you can do tenth derivatives now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the second derivative is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, this law, what I'm saying really is that this law is obviously, quote unquote, 'true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "' Okay, I'm not even going to put it in quotes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's obviously true for the operator, <EXPRESSION>, and the operator <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, therefore, it's true for linear combinations of these as well by linearity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, therefore, also true for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, so if you calculate it out, what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> times the coefficient plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "So, it's in fact exactly this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, how are we going to use this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the idea is very simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, we're trying to solve this, I should have some consistent notation for these equations.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "Purple, I think, will be the right thing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You are solving purple equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The formulas which will solve them will be orange formulas, and we will see what we need as we go along.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I would like to just formulate it, this solution, the particular solution now.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "I'm going to call it a theorem.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "It's really too simple to be a theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, it's too important not to be a theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's call it, as I called it in the notes, the exponential input theorem, which says it all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Theorem says it's important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exponential input means it's taking <EXPRESSION> to be an exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's an exponential input, and the theorem tells you what the response is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for that equation, I'm not going to recopy the equation for the purple equation, adequately indicated this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now try to take notes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the purple equation, a solution is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somewhere I neglected to say that <EXPRESSION>, all right, so for the purple = <EXPRESSION>, how about that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That equation, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's the exponential input.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solution is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's a very useful formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, Haynes Miller, who also teaches this course, in his notes calls of the most important theorem in the course.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I don't have to totally agree with him, but it's certainly important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's probably the most important theorem for these two weeks, anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you will have others as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so that's a theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The theorem is going green.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can tell what they are by their color code.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in other words, what I've done is simply write down the solution for you, write down the particular solution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 52}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "But let's verify it in general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the proof would be what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I have to substitute it into the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So, the equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I want to know, when I substitute that expression in, is it the case that when I plug it in, that the right-hand side, I calculate it out, apply <EXPRESSION> to it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 90}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 135}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 149}]}
{"text": "Is it the case that I get <EXPRESSION> on the right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, all you have to do is do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the substitution rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "What about this guy?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This guy is a constant, so it just gets dragged along because this operator is linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this applied to that is this, then if I apply it to one half that, I get one half the answer, and so on.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> is a constant and just gets dragged along.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, they cancel each other, and the answer is, indeed, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That's not much of a proof.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope that to at least half this class, you're wondering, yes, but what if Peter had not caught the wolf?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, what if?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm looking stern.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, we will take care of it in the simplest possible way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We will assume that <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "The case <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is, in fact, an extremely important case, one that makes the world go 'round, one that contributes to all sorts of catastrophes, and they occur first here in the solution of differential equations, and that's what controls all the catastrophes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, there's a good side to it, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It also makes a lot of good things happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there are no moral judgments in mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the time being, let's assume <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "And, that proof is okay because the <EXPRESSION>, being in the denominator, it's okay to be in the denominator if you're not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's work in a simple example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm picking the most complicated example I can think of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Simple examples, I'll leave for your practice and for the recitations, can start off with simple examples if you are confused by this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's solve an equation, find a particular solution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Gulp.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so, the input is this function, <EXPRESSION>, it's a decaying oscillation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're seeing those already on the computer screen if you started your homework, if you've done problem one on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a decaying exponential, and I want to find a particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's find a particular and the general solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the general solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the main part of the work is finding the particular solution, but let's quickly, the general solution, let's find first the complementary part of it, in other words, the solution to the homogeneous equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, let's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to solve messy quadratics.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Okay, we're going to find a particular solution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "I thought it was going to come out easy, and then I realized it wasn't because I picked the wrong signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so if you don't like, just change the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can do that, but you cannot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't forget that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we want a particular solution in our equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is this = that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's complexify it to make this part of a complex exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the complex exponential that's relevant is <EXPRESSION>, you see that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the imaginary part of this complex exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is imaginary part of that guy, <EXPRESSION>, and the imaginary part of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>, of course, just comes along for the ride.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, well, now, since this is a complex equation, I shouldn't call this <EXPRESSION> anymore by my notation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "I like to call it <EXPRESSION> to indicate that the solution we get to this is not going to be the original solution to the original problem, but you will have to take the imaginary part of it to get it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So, we are looking, now, for the complex solution to this complexified equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the complex particular solution I can write down immediately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>, that, of course, just gets dragged along by linearity, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "And, it's over this polynomial evaluated at this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, just write it down with, have faith.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So, what do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "square that, because I'm substituting this <EXPRESSION> into that polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason I'm doing that is because the formula tells me to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be that solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I've done is substitute <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> in that polynomial, the quadratic polynomial.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And now, all I want is the imaginary part of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The imaginary part of this will be the solution to the original problem because this was the right hand side with the imaginary part of the complexified right hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, now, let's make it look a little better, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Clearly, what we have to do something nice to the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'll copy the numerator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> and how about the denominator?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, again, don't expand things out because it's already this long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what's the point of making it this long?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You want to make it as long, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, then there is room here for one real number, and another real number times <EXPRESSION>, there's no more room.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, what's the real number?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, we're looking for the real part of this expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, just put it in and keep it mentally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION>: that's <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can forget about that term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The term gives me <EXPRESSION> for the real part, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "The answer is that the real part is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about the imaginary part?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, from here, there's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm expanding that out by the binomial theorem, or whatever you like to call that, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "Is that right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it is <EXPRESSION>, and now in the denominator I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll put that in the numerator, make it <EXPRESSION>, but I have to divide by the product of <EXPRESSION> and its complex conjugate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 77}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 89}]}
{"text": "In other words, I'm multiplying both top and bottom by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, that makes here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, of that, what we want is just the imaginary part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> goes into <EXPRESSION> makes <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're practically at our solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The solution, then, finally, is going to be <EXPRESSION> is the imaginary part of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what's that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's the coefficient out front, first of all?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, so let's pull out to <EXPRESSION> before we forget it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "And, we'll pull out the <EXPRESSION> before we forget that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "And then, the rest is simply a question of seeing what's left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want the imaginary part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the imaginary part is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and then the other imaginary part comes from these <EXPRESSION> pieces, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that should be the particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice that most of the work is not getting this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's turning it into something human that you can take the real and imaginary parts of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we don't like this form, you can put it in the other form, which many engineers would do almost automatically, make it <EXPRESSION>, and what will that be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can use the general formula if you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION> coefficients are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it is times, this part makes <EXPRESSION> over the angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, all right, now let's address the case which is going to occupy a lot of the rest of today, and in a certain sense, all of next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in order to be able to handle this decently, it's necessary to have one more formula, which is very slightly more complicated than the substitution rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's the same kind of rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to call this, or it is called the exponential.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So, I'm going to first prove a formula, which is the analog of that, and then I will prove a green formula, which is what to do here if <EXPRESSION> turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "But, in order to be able to prove that, we're going to be the analog of the orange formula.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "And, the analogue of the orange formula, that tells you how to apply <EXPRESSION> to a simple exponential.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "I need a formula which applies <EXPRESSION> to that simple exponential times another function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I found I got into trouble by continuing to call that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "So, I'm now going to change the name of <EXPRESSION> to change <EXPRESSION> name to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "But, it's still complex.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't mean it's guaranteed to be complex.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean it's allowed to be complex.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a is now allowed to be a complex number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm thinking of it, in general, as a complex number, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I hope this doesn't upset you too much, but you know, you change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "This is no worse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, what we going to do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm going to use this exponential shift rule, I'll call it, exponential shift rule or formula or law.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "That's the substitution rule for me.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So, this is going to be exponential shift law.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "And, to apply, it tells you how to apply the polynomial to not <EXPRESSION>, not just the exponential, but the exponential times some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "What's that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the rule is very simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, you can understand the difficulty.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you try to start differentiating, you're going to have to calculate second derivatives of the stuff, and God forbid, higher order equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You would have to calculate fourth derivatives, fifth derivatives.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "You barely even want to calculate the first derivative.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "That's okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, second derivative, do I have to?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No, not if you know the exponential shift rule, which says you can get rid of the <EXPRESSION>, make it pass to the left of the operator where it's not in any position to do any harm any longer, or upset the differentiation.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "And, all you have to do is, when it passes over that operator, it changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the answer is, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There, it's passed over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, when it did so, it changed <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what about the u?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the u just stayed there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nothing happened to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, there's our orange formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess we better put the thing around the whole business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Should I prove that, or the proof is quite easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do it just again to give you a chance to try to see, now, if somebody gives you a formula like that, you first stare at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might try a couple of special cases, try it on a function and see if it works, but already, you probably don't want to do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, even if you took a function like <EXPRESSION> here, you'd have to do a certain amount of differentiating, and some quadratic thing here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'd calculate and calculate away for a little while, and then if you did it correctly, the two would in fact turn out to be =.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "But, you would not necessarily feel any the wiser.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A better procedure in trying to understand something like this is say, well, let's keep the u general.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose we make <EXPRESSION> simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, well, if <EXPRESSION> is a constant, of course there's nothing to happen because if this is just a constant, both sides of these are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This doesn't make any sense if <EXPRESSION> doesn't really have a <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what's the simplest polynomial which would have a <EXPRESSION> in it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's take a special case.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, and check the formula in that case; see if it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the formula is asking us, what is <EXPRESSION>, that's the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not going to put in the variable here because it's just a waste of chalk.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know how to calculate that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "I'll use the product rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So, it's the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you what; let's do the other order first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do you follow that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the product rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, which is this thing times <EXPRESSION>, the other factor.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "Now, is that right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to make it look like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, to make it look like that I should first factor <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what's left?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I factor <EXPRESSION>, what's left is <EXPRESSION>, which is exactly <EXPRESSION> operating on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Well, hey, that's just what the formula said it should be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you make <EXPRESSION> pass over <EXPRESSION>, it changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, now here's the main thing I want to show you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, now, well let's try, if this is true, also works out for <EXPRESSION>, then the formula is clearly true by linearity because an arbitrary <EXPRESSION> is just a linear combination with constant coefficients of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and that constant thing, which we agreed there was nothing to prove about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, hack, you're a hack if you take <EXPRESSION> and start calculating the second derivative of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, it's question about hacks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it's just, you haven't learned the right thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, that will work, but it's not what you want to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Instead, you bootstrap your way up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have already a formula telling me how to handle this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you can be anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Look at this not as <EXPRESSION> all by itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Calculate, instead, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "Think of that as <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, we will do it one step at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you see now immediately the advantage of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I just calculated that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, don't go back to the beginning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't go back to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Use the formula.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "After all, you worked to calculate it, or I did.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> of, and what's this inside?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that looks like a mess, but it isn't because I'm taking <EXPRESSION> times something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I already know how to take <EXPRESSION> times something.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "It doesn't matter what that something is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, the something was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, the something is <EXPRESSION> operating on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the principle is the same, and the answer is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, to take <EXPRESSION> times something, you pass the <EXPRESSION> over the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "That changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you apply that to the other guy, which is <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "What's the answer?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just what you would have gotten if you had taken <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, pass it over, and then changed <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, another advantage to doing it this way is you can see that this argument is going to generalize to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, you would continue on in the same way by the process of mathematical, one word, mathematical, begins with an I, induction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By induction, you would prove the same formula for the nth derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you don't know what mathematical induction is, shame on you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A lot of you will be able to go through life without ever having to learn what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the rest of you will be computer scientists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so that's the idea of this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, we can use it to calculate something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, I'm going to need green for this, I guess, for our better formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The formula, now, that tells you what to do if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're trying to solve the equation, <EXPRESSION>, we are trying to find a particular solution, <EXPRESSION>, let's say.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION> is complex.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> could be complex.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't have to be real.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the problem is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do I get a particular solution?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I will write it down for you.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So, this is part of that exponential input theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's the way it is in the notes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I gave all the cases together, but I thought pedagogically it's probably a little better to do the simplest case first, and then build up on the complexity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, except now you have to multiply it by <EXPRESSION> out front.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "Where have you done something like that before?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, don't tell me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know you know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what should go in the denominator?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Clearly not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What goes in the denominator is the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, but what if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Couldn't that happen?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, it could happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we better make cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This case is, the case where this is okay corresponds to the case where we're going to assume that alpha is a simple root, is a simple root of the polynomial, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know what to call the variable, <EXPRESSION> is okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A simple <EXPRESSION>, in other words, it's not double.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, suppose is double.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One of the consequences you will see just in a second, if it's a simple <EXPRESSION>, that means this derivative is not going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's automatic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, well, suppose it's not as simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, suppose is a double root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How did a-- How did that get changed to, argh! [LAUGHTER] That's not an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, well, yes it is, obviously.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Change! All of you, I want you to change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They should have something like in a search key where <EXPRESSION> occurrences of alpha have been changed to a with a stroke of a, just your thumb.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They don't have that for the blackboard, unfortunately.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, too bad, for the future.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Correctable blackboards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what if a is double root?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It can't be more than a double root because you've only got a quadratic polynomial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Quadratic polynomials only have two roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the worst that can happen is that both of them are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, in that case the formula should be <EXPRESSION> =, you are now going to need <EXPRESSION> up there times <EXPRESSION>, and in the denominator what you are going to need is the second derivative of, evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "Now, you can guess the way this going to go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For higher degree things, if you've got a triple root, you will need here <EXPRESSION>, except you're going to need a factorial there, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, don't worry about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's in the notes, but I'm not going to give you that for higher roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't even know if I will give it to you for double root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, I already did, so it's too late.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's too late.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so we will make this two formulas according to whether a is a single or a double root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's prove one of these, and all of that will be good enough for my conscience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's prove the first one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Mostly, it's an exercise in using the first exponential shift rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, this will be a first example actually seeing a work in practice as opposed to proving it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so what does that thing look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what does the polynomial look like, which has a as a simple root?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we're going to try to prove the simple root case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm just going to calculate what those guys actually look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does <EXPRESSION> look like if a is a simple root?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if it's a simple root, that means it has a factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When it factors, it factors into the product of <EXPRESSION> times something which isn't, <EXPRESSION> minus some other root.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"text": "And, the point is that <EXPRESSION> is not = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The roots are really distinct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, what's, then, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to have to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "What is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's calculate <EXPRESSION> first.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "It is, well, by the ordinary product rule, it's the derivative of this times, which is <EXPRESSION> plus, that's one thing plus the same thing on the other side, the derivative of this, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 41}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 104}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And therefore, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's nothing but, this part is <EXPRESSION>, and that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, this is not <EXPRESSION> because it's a simple root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's the proof for you if you want, that if the root is simple, that p prime of a is guaranteed not to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you can see, it's going to be <EXPRESSION> exactly when <EQUATION>, and that root occurs twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I'm assuming that didn't happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, then all the rest we have to do is calculate, do the calculation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what I want to prove now is that with this <EXPRESSION>, what I'm trying to calculate that <EXPRESSION> times that guy, <EXPRESSION>, except I'm going to write it as <EXPRESSION>, guess why, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 89}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 113}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 158, "end_offset": 163}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 195, "end_offset": 205}]}
{"text": "This is my proposed particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what I have to do is calculate it, and see that it turns out to be, what do I hope it turns out to be?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "What the right hand side of the equation, the input?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The input is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is true, then <EXPRESSION>, a particular solution, indeed, nothing will be a particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, there could be others, but in this game, I only have to find one particular solution, and that certainly by far is the simple as one you could possibly find.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I have to calculate this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And now, you see why I did the exponential shift rule because this is begging to be differentiated by something simpler than hack.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, you can also see why I violated the natural order of things and put the e to the ax on the left in order that it pass over more easily.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the answer on the left-hand side is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Write it in this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is, change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So, the first factor is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what's the second factor?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "It turns into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All this is the result of taking that <EXPRESSION>, and changing <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, this is to be applied to what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is already passed over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's to be divided by the constant, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "Now, what does this all come out to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, what's <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "One, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what's this thing applied to the constant one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the <EXPRESSION> kills it, so it has no effect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It makes it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rest just multiplies it by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the answer to the top is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the answer to the bottom is <EXPRESSION>, which I showed you by just explicit calculation is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the answer is, <EXPRESSION> comes out right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the other one, the other formula comes out the same way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll leave that as an exercise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Also, I don't dare do it because it's much too close to the problem I asked you to do for homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's by way of conclusion, I'll do one more simple example, okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you can feel you understand something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm sort of bothered that I haven't done any examples of this more complicated case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'll pick an easy version instead of the one that you have in your notes, which is the one you have for homework, which is even easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this one's epsilon less easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, notice that one is a simple root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The one I'm talking about is the a here, which is one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is a simple root of the polynomial <EXPRESSION>, isn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put <EQUATION> and you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "It's a simple root because anybody can see that one is not a double root because you know from critical damping, if one were a double root, you know just what the polynomial would look like, and it wouldn't look like that at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would not look like <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would look differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Therefore, that proves that <EXPRESSION> is a simple root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, what's the particular solution, therefore?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The particular solution is <EXPRESSION> divided by the derivative, the derivative evaluated at the point, so, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I evaluate it at the point, <EXPRESSION>, it is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So, if this is to be divided by <EXPRESSION>, in other words, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "And, if you don't believe it, you could plug it in and check it out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "Okay, I'm letting you out one minute early.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to pay off the accumulated debt.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: All right, so let's begin lecture six.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're talking today about exponentials and logarithms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these are the last functions that I need to introduce, the last standard functions that we need to connect with calculus, that you've learned about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're certainly as fundamental, if not more so, than trigonometric functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, we'll start out with a number, <EXPRESSION>, which is positive, which is usually called a base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we have these properties that <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how we get started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And of course <EXPRESSION>, not surprisingly, is <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the general rule is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the basic rule of exponents, and with these two initial properties, that defines the exponential function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's an additional property, which is deduced from these, which is the composition of exponential functions, which is that you take <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 139, "end_offset": 143}]}
{"text": "Then that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's an additional property that we'll take for granted, which you learned in high school.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in order to understand what all the values of <EXPRESSION> are, we need to first remember that if you're taking a rational power that it's the ratio of <EXPRESSION> integers power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to have to take the nth root of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, when you're defining <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is defined for all <EXPRESSION> by filling in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna use that expression in quotation marks, 'filling in' by continuity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is really what your calculator does when it gives you <EXPRESSION>, because you can't even punch in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't really exist on your calculator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's some decimal expansion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it takes the decimal expansion to a certain length and spits out a number which is pretty close to the correct answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But indeed, in theory, there is an <EXPRESSION>, even though the <EXPRESSION> is irrational.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's <EXPRESSION> and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's the exponential function, and let's draw a picture of one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll try, say <EQUATION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm not going to draw such a careful graph, but let's just plot the most important point, which is the point (0, 1).", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then maybe we'll go back up here to <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is this point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is (-1, 1/2), the reciprocal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And over here, we have <EXPRESSION>, and so that goes all the way up to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then exponentials are remarkably fast.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's off the board what happens next out at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's already above my range here, but the graph looks something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I've just visually, at least, graphically filled in all the rest of the points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have to imagine all these rational numbers, and so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this point here would have been (1, 2).", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so forth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's not too far along.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now what's our goal?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, obviously we want to do calculus here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our goal, here, for now - and it's gonna take a while.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to think about it pretty hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to calculate what this derivative is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "All right, so we'll get started.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way we get started is simply by plugging in the definition of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, the only step that we can really perform here to make this is into something a little bit simpler is to use this very first rule that we have here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That the exponential of the sum is the product of the exponentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I want to use is just the property that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "And if I do that, I see that I can factor out a common factor in the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 41}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "So we'll write this as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> times this ratio, now <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "So far, so good?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're actually almost to some serious progress here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's one other important conceptual step which we need to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a relatively simple one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We actually did this before, by the way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did this with sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next thing I want to point out to you is that you're used to thinking of <EXPRESSION> as being the variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, already we were discussing <EXPRESSION> as being the variable and <EXPRESSION> as being fixed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But for the purposes of this limit, there's a different variable that's moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is fixed and <EXPRESSION> is the thing that's moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that this factor here, which is a common factor, is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can just factor it out of the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't affect the limit at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A constant times a limit is the same as whether we multiply before or after we take the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm just going to factor that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's my next step here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, and then I have the limit <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what I have here, so this is by definition the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here is <EXPRESSION>, and it's = this expression here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I want to stare at this expression, and see what it's telling us, because it's telling us as much as we can get so far, without some-- So first let's just look at what this says.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what it's saying is that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times something that we don't yet know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to call this something, this mystery number, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna make the label, <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of a to the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this mystery number <EXPRESSION> has a geometric interpretation, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me describe that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has a geometric interpretation, and it's a very, very significant number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's work out what that is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So first of all, let's rewrite the expression in the box, using the shorthand for this number.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "So if I just rewrite it, it says <EXPRESSION> = this factor, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 89}]}
{"text": "So the derivative of the exponential is this mystery number times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "So we've almost solved the problem of finding the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just have to figure out this one number, <EXPRESSION>, and we get the rest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me point out two more things about this number, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, if I plug in <EQUATION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION> , at <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "According to this formula, that's <EXPRESSION>, which of course <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of this function at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the slope of <EQUATION>, of the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The graph of <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again over here, if you looked at the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll draw the one tangent line in here, which is this one here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this thing has slope, what we're calling <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I graph the function <EQUATION>, I'll get a certain slope here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "If I graph it with a different base, I might get another slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what we got so far is the following phenomenon: if we know this one number, if we know the slope at this one place, we will be able to figure out the formula for the slope everywhere else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that's actually exactly the same thing that we did for sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We knew the slope of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> function at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The sine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cosine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then from the sum formulas, well that's exactly this kind of thing here, from the sum formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This sum formula, in fact is easier than the ones for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From the sum formulas, we worked out what the slope was everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're following the same procedure that we did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But at this point we're stuck.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're stuck, because that time using radians, this very clever idea of radians in geometry, we were able to actually figure out what the slope is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whereas here, we're not so sure, what <EXPRESSION> is, for instance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just don't know yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the basic question that we have to deal with right now is what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what we're left with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the curious fact is that the clever thing to do is to beg the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to go through a very circular route here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is circuitous, not circular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Circular is a bad word in math.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that one thing depends on another, and that depends on it, and maybe both are wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Circuitous means, we're going to be taking a roundabout route.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to discover that even though we refuse to answer this question right now, we'll succeed in answering it eventually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how are we going to beg the question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we're going to say instead is we're going to define a mystery base, or number <EXPRESSION>, as the unique number, so that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "That's the trick that we're going to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't yet know what <EXPRESSION> is, but we're just going to suppose that we have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to show you a bunch of consequences of this, and also I have to persuade you that it actually does exist.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first, let me explain what the first consequence is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then if you look at this formula over here and you write it down for e, you have something which is a very usable formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so that's an incredibly important formula which is the fundamental one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the only one you have to remember from what we've done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I should have highlighted it in several colors here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a big deal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very happy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, let me just emphasize, also that this is the one which at <EQUATION> has slope <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the way we defined it, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you plug in <EQUATION> here on the right hand side, you got <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Slope <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except of course, since we don't know what <EXPRESSION> is, this is a little bit dicey.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, next even before explaining what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, we won't get to what <EXPRESSION> really is until the very end of this lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have to persuade you why <EXPRESSION> exists.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to have some explanation for why we know there is such a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so first of all, let me start with the one that we supposedly know, which is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll call it <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the first thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember, that the property that it had, was that <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was the derivative of this function, the slope at <EQUATION> of the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of the tangent line, that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, what we're going to consider is any kind of stretching.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to stretch this function by a factor <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "Any number <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we're going to consider is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you do that, that's the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now if I use the second law of exponents that I have over there, that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as some base <EXPRESSION>, where <EXPRESSION> =-- Let's write that down over here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 188, "end_offset": 193}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So whatever it is, if I have a different base which is expressed in terms of <EXPRESSION>, of the form <EXPRESSION>, then that new function is described by this function <EXPRESSION>, the stretch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens when you stretch a function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same thing as shrinking the x axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> gets larger, this corresponding point over here would be over here, and so this corresponding point would be over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you shrink this picture, and the slope here tilts up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, as we increase <EXPRESSION>, the slope gets steeper and steeper.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see that explicitly, numerically, here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Explicitly, numerically, if I take the derivative here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's the chain rule, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if we do it at <EXPRESSION>, we're just getting <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> times this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "So how is it exactly that we cook up the right base <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION> when <EQUATION> over this number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, we can pick all possible slopes that we want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This just has the effect of multiplying the slope by a factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can shift the slope at <EXPRESSION> however we want, and we're going to do it so that the slope exactly matches <EXPRESSION>, the one that we want.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But at least we know that it's there somewhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: How do you know it's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: How do I know?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've decided what <EXPRESSION> is, so therefore there's a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And furthermore, by the chain rule, there's a formula for the derivative.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "And it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, scaling does this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, we did exactly the same thing with the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you think of the sine function here, let me just remind you here, what happens with the chain rule, you get <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "So the fact that we set things up beautifully with radians that this thing is, but we could change the scale to anything, such as degrees, by the appropriate factor <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there would be this scale factor shift of the derivative formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, the one with radians is the easy one, because the factor is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The one with degrees is horrible, because the factor is some crazy number like <EXPRESSION>, or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so there's something going on here which is exactly the same as that kind of re-scaling.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far we've got only one formula which is a keeper here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have a preliminary formula that we still haven't completely explained which has a little wavy line there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have to fit all these things together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so now to fit them together, I need to introduce the natural log.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the natural log is denoted this way, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe I'll call it a new letter name, we'll call it <EQUATION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "But if we were reversing things, if we started out with a function <EQUATION> , the property that it would have is that it's the inverse function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it has the property that the <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this defines the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now the logarithm has a bunch of properties and they come from the exponential properties in principle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You remember these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm just going to remind you of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the main one that I just want to remind you of is that the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe a few more are worth reminding you of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A second is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these correspond to the inverse relationships here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I plug in here, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "If I plug in <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, I get the corresponding numbers here: <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "And maybe it would be worth it to plot the picture once to reinforce this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I'll put them on the same chart.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "If you have here <EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then the logarithm which I'll maybe put in a different color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this crosses at this all-important point here, (0, 1).", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now in order to figure out what the inverse function is, I have to take the flip across the diagonal <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this shape here, going down like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the point (1, 0).", "entities": []}
{"text": "So (1, 0) corresponds to this identity here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice, so this is <EXPRESSION>, the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice it's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive, which corresponds to the fact that <EXPRESSION> is always positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, this white curve is only above this axis, and the orange one is to the right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, one other thing I should mention is the slope here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the slope there is also going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what we're allowed to do relatively easily, because we have the tools to do it, is to compute the derivative of the logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, we're going to use implicit differentiation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "This is how we find the derivative of any inverse function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So remember the way that works is if you know the derivative of the function, you can find the derivative of the inverse function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the mechanism is the following: you write down here <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "Here's the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're trying to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we don't know how to differentiate this equation, but if we exponentiate it, so that's the same thing as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because let's just stick this in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now we can differentiate this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do the differentiation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then this, by the chain rule, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "The product of these two factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this guy, the one little guy that we actually know and can use, that's this guy here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so finally, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we discovered is, and now I get to put another green guy around here, is that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So alright, now we have two companion formulas here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is itself, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's time to return to the problem that we were having a little bit of trouble with, which is somewhat not explicit, which is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We want to now differentiate <EXPRESSION> in general, not just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So let's work that out, and I want to explain it in a couple of ways, so you're going to have to remember this, because I'm going to erase it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what I'd like you to do is, so now I want to teach you how to differentiate basically any exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now to differentiate any exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are two methods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're practically the same method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They have the same amount of arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see both of them, and they're equally valuable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to just describe them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Method one I'm going to illustrate on the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're interested in differentiating this thing, exactly this problem that I still didn't solve yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the procedure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The procedure is to write, so the method is to use base <EXPRESSION>, or convert to base .", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "So how do you convert to base <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Well, you write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> to some power.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So what power is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> to the power <EXPRESSION>, to the power <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've made our conversion now to base <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The exponential of something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm going to carry out the differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, this is a step which causes great confusion when you first see it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you must get used to it, because it's easy, not hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate of change of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is, let me do it by analogy here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because say I had <EXPRESSION> and I were differentiating it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The chain rule would say that this is just <EXPRESSION>, the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the ordinary chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "And what we're doing up here is exactly the same thing, because <EXPRESSION>, as frightening as it looks, with all three letters there, is just a fixed number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the constant just accelerates the rate of change by that factor, which is what the chain rule is doing.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same business here with ln a replacing <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is something you've got to get used to in time for the exam, for instance, because you're going to be doing a million of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So do get used to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, this expression here was the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So another way of writing this, and I'll put this into a box, but actually I never remember this particularly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just re-derive it every time, is that the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm going to get rid of what's underneath it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is another formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the formula I've essentially finished here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice, what is the magic number?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The magic number is the natural log of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't know what it was in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the natural log of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me emphasize to you again, something about what's going on here, which has to do with scale change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, these are the two most obvious bases that you might want to use, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So one of the things that's natural about the natural logarithm is that even if we insisted that we must use base <EXPRESSION>, or that we must use base <EXPRESSION>, we'd still be stuck with natural logarithms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They come up naturally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the ones which are independent of our human construct of base <EXPRESSION> and base <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The natural logarithm is the one that comes up without reference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll be mentioning a few other ways in which it's natural later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I told you about this first method, now I want to tell you about a second method here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the second is called logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how does this work?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, sometimes you're having trouble differentiating a function, and it's easier to differentiate its logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That may seem peculiar, but actually we'll give several examples where this is clearly the case, that the logarithm is easier to differentiate than the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it could be that this is an easier quantity to understand.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we want to relate it back to the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to write it a slightly different way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Let's write it in terms of primes here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "So the basic identity is the chain rule again, and the derivative of the logarithm, well maybe I'll write it out this way first.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "So this would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the two factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the same thing, so remember what the derivative of the logarithm is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I have a <EXPRESSION>, and here I have a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to encode this on the next board here, which is sort of the main formula you always need to remember, which is that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the one to remember here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: The question is how did I get this step here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect <EXPRESSION>, times the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 129, "end_offset": 134}]}
{"text": "That's the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So now I've worked out this identity here, and now let's show how it handles this case, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to get that one, I would take <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "And now let's just take a look at what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I claim that this is pretty easy to differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, it may seem hard, but it's actually quite easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe somebody can hazard a guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same thing that I was talking about before, which is if you've got <EXPRESSION>, and you're taking its derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> here, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the kind of thing you have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, don't be put off by this massive piece of junk here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, keep that in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It comes up regularly in this kind of question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's our formula, that the logarithmic derivative is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's just rewrite that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "That's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which is <EQUATION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is our differentiation formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, if I just multiply through by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what we wanted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the way that logarithmic differentiation works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same arithmetic as the previous method, but we don't have to convert to base <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're just keeping track of the exponents and doing differentiation on the exponents, and multiplying through at the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I'm going to do two trickier examples, which illustrate logarithmic differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, these could be done equally well by using base <EXPRESSION>, but I won't do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Method one and method two always both work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a second example: again this is a problem when you have moving exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this time, we're going to complicate matters by having both a moving exponent and a moving base.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have a function <EXPRESSION>, which is, well maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>, since we already had a function <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "A really complicated looking function here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again you can handle this by converting to base <EXPRESSION>, method one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we'll do the logarithmic differentiation version, alright?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I take the logs of both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "And now I differentiate it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And now when I differentiate this here, I have to use the product rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "This time, instead of having <EXPRESSION>, a constant, I have a variable here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have two factors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> when I differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "When I differentiate with respect to this factor here, I get that <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of that, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So, here's my formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Almost finished.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to multiply these two things together.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "I'll put it on the other side, because I don't want to get it mixed up with <EXPRESSION>, the quantity.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "And now I'm almost done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have <EQUATION>, and that's just <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these two methods always work for moving exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next thing that I'd like to do is another fairly tricky example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this one is not strictly speaking within calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although we're going to use the tools that we just described to carry it out, in fact it will use some calculus in the very end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to evaluate the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "So now, the reason why I want to discuss this is, is it turns out to have a very interesting answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's a problem that you can approach exactly by this method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is that it has a moving exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The exponent n here is changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if you want to keep track of that, a good way to do that is to use logarithms.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "So in order to figure out this limit, we're going to take the log of it and figure out what the limit of the log is, instead of the log of the limit.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "Those will be the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to take the natural log of this quantity here, and that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And now I'm going to rewrite this in a form which will make it more recognizable, so what I'd like to do is I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>, or maybe I should say it this way: <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 121, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is going to infinity, then this <EXPRESSION> is going to be going to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is more familiar territory for us in this class, anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's rewrite it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So here, we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then that is multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the reciprocal of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I want to change this in a very, very minor way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So that's the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "That's just = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not a problem, and I'll put some parentheses around it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now you're supposed to recognize, all of a sudden, what pattern this fits into.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the thing which we need to calculate in order to calculate the derivative of the log function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "So this is, in the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to ,<EXPRESSION> = the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well the base point is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's where we're evaluating it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the base value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the difference quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this by definition tends to the limit here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we know what the derivative of the log function is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of the log function is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this limit is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we got it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We got the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we just have to work backwards to figure out what this limit that we've got over here is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The log approached <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So sorry, the log of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, let's write it this way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "It's the same thing, as well, the thing that we know is the log of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the one that we just figured out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now this thing is the exponential of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's really <EXPRESSION> to this power here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this guy is the same as the limit of the log of the limit of the thing, which is the same as log of the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The limit of the log and the log of the limit are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I take the logarithm, then I'm going to take the exponential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That just undoes what I did before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this limit is just <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the limit that we want here = .", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claim that with this step, we've actually closed the loop, finally.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we have an honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "The first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are many such.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this one is a perfectly honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "We had this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We didn't know exactly what it was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was this <EXPRESSION>, there was <EXPRESSION>, the logarithm, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have all that stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we really need to nail down what this number <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is telling us, if you take for example <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be a very good, perfectly decent anyway, approximation to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "So this is a numerical approximation, which is all we can ever do with just this kind of irrational number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that closes the loop, and we now have a coherent family of functions, which are actually well defined and for which we have practical methods to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, see you next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Today we're going to do a problem about least squares approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Find the quadratic equation through the origin that is a best fit for these three points: (1, 1), (2, 5), and (-1, -2).", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll give you a minute to work that out on your own.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can hit the pause button now, and we'll be back in a minute to work the problem out together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK and we're back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the first step in a problem like this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first step is figuring out what our equation looks like, the one that we're going to find.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So our equation is going to look like <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we're looking for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're looking for a quadratic equation through the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if it were just any quadratic equation, then we would have a constant term, but through the origin just means that the constant term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what's the next step?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Next we need to set up a matrix equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need an <EXPRESSION>, a matrix <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And which matrix is that going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me start with the first coordinate of these three points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to put them in the first column of this matrix, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then my second column is going to be the squares of these coordinates, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my <EXPRESSION>-- that's just <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my <EXPRESSION>-- this is going to be the second coordinates, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, why did I set this problem up like that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, multiply <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first coordinate of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just the same as plugging in this first point into the left-hand side of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And similarly, if I took the second point and plugged it in here, I would just get <EXPRESSION>, which is just the same as the second coordinate in the multiplication <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and where did the <EXPRESSION> come from?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> came from plugging in these points to the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are just the y-coordinates of these three points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it would be great if we could solve <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "But we can't solve <EQUATION>, because there isn't a quadratic equation through the origin that contains these three points.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "But we need to find the best approximation to that, so that's the same as solving <EXPRESSION> = the projection of <EXPRESSION> onto the column space of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we only have a chance of solving <EXPRESSION> = something if it's in the column space of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And remember from our projections part of the class that this is the same as solving <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what we're really going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're really going to solve <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And now all we have to do is just a computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do this kind of quickly, because you should be good at multiplying matrices by now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh this-- I have the negative in the wrong place, thank you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thanks for that correction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have the negative backwards there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what do I get when I multiply these?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll let you check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you multiply this out, I'll let you check that you get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just some computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what we're solving here is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we remember how to do this just by using elimination.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We replace the second row by <EXPRESSION> times the second row minus <EXPRESSION> times the first row.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 62}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "Again, I'm going to do this quickly because you know this from other parts of the class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You similarly change the b vector, and we backsolve to get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> =-- let's plug that in and see-- think you're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 119}]}
{"text": "So what's our final equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our final equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is our best fit quadratic equation through the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now before I end, let me do a couple things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First, let me go back and review what the key steps were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whenever you're faced with such a best fit equation, first, you want to see what the general form of the equation is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Next you want to write it in terms of matrices.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "Write down your matrix <EXPRESSION> and your vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "And lastly, you set up your projection equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then all you have to do is just a computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it might also be worth noting that these three points certainly aren't on this quadratic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For instance, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I don't get (1, 1), I get (1, 3).", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "But that's OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is as close as we can do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: So again, welcome back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And today's topic is a continuation of what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We still have a little bit of work and thinking to do concerning polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to talk about polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And my first job today is to talk a little bit about area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's something we didn't mention last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And since we're all back from Thanksgiving, we can certainly talk about it in terms of a pie.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the basic idea for area in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's our pie, and here's a slice of the pie.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The slice has a piece of arc length on it, which I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "And the area of that shaded-in slice, I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "And let's suppose that the radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Little <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a pie of radius <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it's pretty easy to figure out what the area that slice of pie is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The total area is, of course, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And to get this fraction, <EXPRESSION>, all we have to do is take the percentage of the arc of the total circumference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> / This is the fraction of area-- sorry, fraction of the total circumference, the total length around the rim.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's giving us the total area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you work that out, that's <EXPRESSION> =, the <EXPRESSION> cancel and we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "So here's the basic formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now what we need to do is to talk about a variable pie here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be a pie with a kind of a wavy crust.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is coming around like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The distance from the center is varying with the place where we are, the angle where we're shooting out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I want to subdivide that into little chunks here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the idea for adding up the area, the total area of this piece that's swept out, is to break it up into little slices whose areas are almost easy to calculate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, what we're going to do is to take, and I'm going to label it this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take these little circular arcs, which go-- So I'm going to extend past where this goes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'm going to take each circular arc here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a circular arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then here's another circular arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's another circular arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just right on the nose in that case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in these two cases, so basically the picture that I'm trying to draw for you is this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have some sector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have some circular arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe it takes a little extra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a little extra area, I'm making an error in the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a little extra area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe to draw it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm a little short on this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's say on this one I'm right on the nose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have the same arc as the curve of the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this is a little bit like the step functions that we used in Riemann sums.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's practically the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Eventually, this little band of stuff that we're missing by, if we take very, very narrow little slices here, is going to be negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It'll get closer and closer to the curve itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that area will tend to <EXPRESSION> in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we don't have to worry about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the approximate relationship is sitting here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where this distance now is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so in the approximate case, what we have is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is practically the same thing we had here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except that that <EXPRESSION> is replacing the constant there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's approximately true, because <EXPRESSION> is varying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the limit, we have the exact formula for the differential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the main formula for area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you like, the total area then is going to be the integral from some starting place to some end place of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, this is only useful in the situation that we're in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely-- So this is the other important formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is only useful when <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When this is the way in which the region is presented to us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's our main formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do what example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The example that I'm going to take is the one that we did at the end of last time, or near the end of last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which was this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, that was the same as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what we did last time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We connected this rectangular representation to that polar representation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the picture is of a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where this is the point (2a, 0).", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's figure out what the area is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, first of all, we have to figure out when we sweep out the area, we have to realize that we only go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's something we can get from the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can also get it directly from this formula if you realize that <EXPRESSION> is positive in this range here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at the ends, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the thing encloses a region at these ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So at the ends, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what cinches this up like a little sack, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area is now going to be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: How do I know from looking at the picture that I'm going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, is the question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I do it with my whole body.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I say, here I am pointing down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I sweep up, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I get all the way up to here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the way I do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's really the way I do it, I'm being honest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now if you're a machine, you can't actually look.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you don't have a body, so you can't point your arms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then you would have to go by the formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'd have to actually use something like this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The fact that this is where the loop cinches up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is where the radius comes into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need to know that in order to understand the range.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So when we're doing these, should we just guess that it's going to be a loop?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm probably going to give you some clues as to what's going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's very hard to figure these things out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes it'll be bounded by one curve and another curve, and I'll say it's the thing in between those two curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the kind of thing that I could do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, you really should know this one in advance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is by far the most-- or this is one of the typical cases, anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to give you a couple more examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't get too worked up over this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will somehow be able to visualize it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "I'll give you some examples to help you out with it later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's my integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're faced with a trig integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which we have to remember how to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the trig integral here-- so first let me factor out the constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now you have to remember what you're supposed to do at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So think, if you haven't done it yet, this is practice you need to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This trig integral is handled by a double angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As it happens, I'm going to be giving you these formulas on the review sheet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see they're written on the review sheet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At least in some form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example, there's a formula, and this will be on the exam, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the correct formula to use here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the substitution that you use for the <EXPRESSION> in order to integrate it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "That serves as a little review of trig integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, this is quite easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This integral now is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is it easy?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, because it's the antiderivative of a constant, <EXPRESSION>, its antiderivative you're supposed to be able to write down.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "So the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the antiderivative of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the sine when it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the signs go away because they're both <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all told we get <EXPRESSION>, which is certainly what we would like it to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the area of the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another question?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question, so I'm not sure which question you're asking.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I pivoted my arm around (0, 0).", "entities": []}
{"text": "This point, this is the point we're talking about, (0, 0), is a key point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's where I guess you could say I stuck my elbow there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason is that it's the place where <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's more or less the center of the universe from the point of view of this problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the reference point and if you like, when you're doing this, it's a little bit like a radar screen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Everything is centered at the origin and you're taking rays coming out from it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And seeing where they're going to go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for example, this is the <EQUATION> ray, this is the <EQUATION> ray.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This the <EQUATION> ray.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, if my elbow is right at this center here, I'm pointing in those various directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what I had in mind when I did that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can always get these formulas, by the way, from the original business, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's useful to have the geometric picture as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, if you were a machine you'd have to rely on these formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And plot things using these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Always.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, in terms of plotting I want to expand your brain a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we need just a little bit more practice with plotting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, the first question that I want to ask you is, what happens outside of this range of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, what happens if <EXPRESSION> beyond <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can somebody see what's happening to the formulas in that case?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what I'm looking at now, let's go back to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I'm looking at is this formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But to use the elbow analogy here, I'm swept around like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now I'm going to point this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to point out over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My hand is up here in the northwest direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's going to happen?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Somebody want to tell me?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: It goes around itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens is that when <EXPRESSION> crosses this vertical, <EQUATION>, when it crosses over here it goes negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So although my theta is pointing me this way, the thing is going to go backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's another clue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is very important.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How far backwards is it going?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you don't actually need to know anything but this equation here, to understand that it has to be on the same circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I'm pointing this way, the things points backwards to this point over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens is, it goes around once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then when I point out this way, it sweeps around a second time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just keeps on going around the same circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So over here it's empty.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's pointing the other way and it's sweeping around the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A second time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you were foolish enough to integrate, say, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> or some wider range, what would happen is you would just double the area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because you would have swept it out twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the mistake that you'll make.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sometimes you'll count things as negative and positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But because there's a square here, it's always a positive quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you'll always over-count if you go too far.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, it sweeps out the same region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because these two equations really are equivalent to each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just that this one sweeps it out twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this one doesn't say how it's sweeping it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah, another question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: Doesn't this equation also work if you just go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: Does the integration work if you just go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The answer is yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a very weird object, though.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just show you what that is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you started from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll illustrate it on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first thing that you swept out between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is this part here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was swept out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, when you're going around this next quadrant here, you're actually sweeping out this underside here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually, you're getting it because you're getting half of it on one half, and getting the other half on the other quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's actually giving you the right answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That turns out to be OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little weird way to chop up a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's legal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, that's an accident of this particular figure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can't count on that happening.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's much better to line it up exactly with what the figure does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So don't do that too often.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You might run into troubles.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to give you a couple more examples of practice with these pictures.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe I'm going to get rid of this one up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's another favorite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's another favorite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this, if you like, is Example 2.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess we had an Example 1 up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're really not going to try to do any more area examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The area examples are actually straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's really just figuring out what the picture looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is examples of drawings.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one is one that's kind of fun to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Something like this is on your homework.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what happens here is the following.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens here is that at <EQUATION>, that's the first place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just plot a few places here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not going to plot very many.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>, that's where I get <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then again, at <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>, which is back at <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's-- And the other thing to say is in between here it's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what it does is, it starts out at <EXPRESSION> and it goes out to the radius <EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it comes back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it does something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes out, and it comes back.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now because of the symmetries of the sine function, this is pretty much all you need to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does something similar in all of the quadrants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in order to see what it's doing, it's useful for you to watch me draw it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the order is very important for understanding what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's similar to this weird business with the circle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So watch me draw this guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll draw it in red because it usually has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It does this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it does this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it does this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it does that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's called a four-leaf rose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I drew it in pink because it's kind of a rose here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it started out over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is Step 1.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the range <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It did this part here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then it went <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I should draw these in white, because they're harder to read in red.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now look at what it did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It did not make a right angle turn.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was nice and smooth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It went around here and then it went down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Back here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then over here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Back up here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then around here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And down here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then back where it started and goes around again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is because actually it's switching sign when it crosses the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When it was over in this quadrant the first time, it actually was tracing what's directly behind it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is kind of amusing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From this little tiny formula you get this pretty diagram here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway that's, as I say, an old favorite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here if you want to do the area of one leaf, you've got to make sure you understand that it's a small piece of the whole.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now I have one last drawing example that I want to discuss with you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it involves another skill that we haven't quite gotten enough practice with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to do that one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's also preparation for an exercise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But one that we're going to do after the test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's my last example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're going to discuss what happens with this function here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, that's not legible, is it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the first thing I want to do is just take our time a little bit and plot a few points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the values of <EXPRESSION> and here are the values of <EXPRESSION>, and we'll see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll try to figure out what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The denominator is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If theta-- I'm going to make it easy, we're not going to do so many.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do <EXPRESSION>, that's an easy value of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that value of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to back up and do <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, again, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'd like to just plot those points anyway, and see what's going on with this expression here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first one is a rectangular-- I'm going to write the rectangular coordinates here, not the polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rectangular coordinates here are <EXPRESSION> out at the horizontal, so it's (1/3, 0).", "entities": []}
{"text": "The polar coordinates is (1/3, 0), but the rectangular coordinate is also that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And over here, at <EXPRESSION>, the distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the point (0, 1) in x-y coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then down here at, <EXPRESSION>, it's (0, -1).", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just emphasize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You should be able to think of this visually if you can crank your arm around and think it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or if you're right-handed you'll bend that way, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or you'll have to use-- But this also works using this formulas <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice that in this case, <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION> but the <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And lo and behold, you get <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here you get <EXPRESSION> here you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did it purely visually or sort of organically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you can also do it by plugging in the numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now in between, the denominator is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's something in between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to sweep around something like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what happens in between.", "entities": []}
{"text": "As <EXPRESSION> increases from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now something interesting happens with this particular function, which is that we notice that the denominator is <EXPRESSION> at a certain place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if I solve <EQUATION>, then the denominator is going to be <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>, so <EXPRESSION> =, it turns out, plus or minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the values here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when we're out here somewhere, in these directions, there's nothing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going infinitely far out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK that's about as much as we'll be able to figure out of this diagram without doing some analytic work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the other little piece that I want to explain.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, going backwards from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is one thing that we haven't done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is the rectangular equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means the (x, y) equation for this <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, first I'm going to clear the denominator here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And the reason for that is that in a minute I'll explain to you why.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this guy, I'm going to square now.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "I'm going to make this <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "And now, with an <EXPRESSION>, I can plug in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "So this is a standard thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's basically what you're going to do any time you're faced with an equation like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is try to work it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in these situations where you have <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, you'll always come out with some quadratic expression like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I'm going to combine terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I have <EXPRESSION>, and put everything on the the left side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we recognize, well you're supposed to recognize, that this is what's known as a hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the signs are the same, it's an ellipse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the the signs are opposite it's a hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in between, if one of the coefficients on the quadratic is <EXPRESSION>, it's a parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we see that the picture that we drew there is actually, turns out it's going to have asymptotes, it's going to be a hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let me ask you the last little mind-bending question that I want to ask.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, what happens-- So now I'm using my right arm, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But my elbow's at the origin here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens if I pass outside, to the range where this denominator is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It crossed <EXPRESSION> and it went to negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's sweeping out something over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it sweeping out the same curve?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anybody have any idea what it's doing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the other branch of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's actually happening is in disguise, there's another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that is consistent with these algebraic equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The algebraic equation that I got here doesn't say which branch of the hyperbola I've got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually got two branches.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the curve really was, in disguise, capturing both of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is a really beautiful connection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to make that connection in connection also with this example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The hyperbolas, as you probably know, are the trajectories of comets.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And ellipses, which is what you would get if maybe you put <EXPRESSION> here instead of a <EXPRESSION>, would be the trajectories of planets or asteroids.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what happens when you get the ellipses as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And pretty much any other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in = areas, this is amount of area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this, its speed varies.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's speed varies according to a very specific rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, this one here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this rule was observed by Kepler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you have this connection here, we also have something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We also know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's this formula here, formally dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the rate of change with respect to this time parameter, which is the honest to goodness time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Real physical time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that means, this quantity here is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is one of the key insights that physicists had, long after Kepler made his physical observations, they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all, because it's a frictionless setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Outer space, there's no air.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nothing is going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is what's known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the expression for angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's exactly this polar formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a neat thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's it for generalities and a little pep talk on what's coming up to you when you learn a little more physics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right now we need to talk about the exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, let me tell you what the topics are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're the same as last year's test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which you can take a look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are three, which we will test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one is partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's more than half of the exam, right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other half of the exam is parametric curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are all interrelated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And area of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are the only kind that we can handle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And area in polar coordinates, including area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's on the test, there are six problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're very similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, they're not actually that similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But they're somewhat similar to last year's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'd say the test is similar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe a tiny bit more difficult.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question was, we didn't do arc length in polar coordinates, did we?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is no, we did not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We did not do arc length in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I give you an exercise, I'm going to ask you about, if you know the speed of a comet here, what's the speed of the comet there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we'll have to know about arc length for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're not doing it on this exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Other questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will I expect you to know <EXPRESSION> =--- so let's see if I can formulate this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's related to this four-leaf rose here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is, suppose I gave you something that looked like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Would I expect you to be able to know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can give you a long time to sketch this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And think about what it does.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you have some clue as to what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It doesn't have six.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because of some weird thing, having to do with repetitions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the odds and evens work differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact I would have to tell you what the picture looks like, if it's going to be this complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, so this is an important point to make, when we come to techniques of integration, any integral that you have, I'm not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if it's an integral that I think you're going to get stuck on, either I'm going to give you a hint, tell you how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I'm going to tell you, don't do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I tell you don't do it, don't try to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It may be impossible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even if it's possible, it's going to be very long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like an hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So don't do it unless I tell you to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the other hand, all of these setups in this second half of this unit, they involve somehow setting something up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're basically three issues.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is what the integrand is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is what the lower limit is, what is the upper limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're just three things, three inputs, to setting up an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All integrals, this is going to be the setup for all of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the second step is evaluating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which really is what we did in the first half here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, unfortunately, we don't have infinitely many techniques and indeed there's some integrals that can't be evaluated and some that are too long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll just try to avoid those.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright, other questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will the percentages be the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll tell you exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unless I change the point values.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what it came out to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You are going to want to know about all of the things that I've written down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're definitely going to want to know, for example, surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How to set those up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was another question I saw.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So if you have a partial fraction with something like <EXPRESSION> and maybe an <EXPRESSION> and maybe an <EXPRESSION>, and you're interested in what happens with this denominator here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's going to happen is, you're going to need a coefficient for each degree of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So altogether, the setup is going to be this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you need-- STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So if I change this to being a <EXPRESSION> here, then I need, I guess I'll have to call it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 130, "end_offset": 134}]}
{"text": "I need that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it gets harder and harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The more repeated roots there are, the more repeated factors there are, the harder it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the ones you can pick off by the cover-up method are, is just the top one here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And these two.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> you can get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you're going to have to do by either plugging in or some other, more elaborate, algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the more of these lower terms there are, the worse off you are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, does this <EXPRESSION> affect this setup.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the answer is almost no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is, not at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same setup exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, there's one thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the degree gets too big, then you've got to use long division first to knock it down.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "I'll give you an example of this type of practice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Unless there are more question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Are you going to have to know how to do reduction formulas?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anything that's a little out of the ordinary like a reduction formula, I will have to coach you to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in other words, what you'll have to be able to do in that situation is follow directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I tell you OK, you're faced with this, then do an integration by parts.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "And do that, then get the reduction formula.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the question had do with the partial fractions method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what happens if you have a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for instance, if it were this, this one's too disgusting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to just do it with two of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the parts with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now you have linear factors here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>-- maybe I'll call them <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "This is the way it works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I'm going to give you one more quick example of an integration technique just to liven things up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a somewhat tricky example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just a little trickier than I would give you on a test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's the same principle, and I may do this on a final exam.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So suppose you're faced with this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What are you going to do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Integration by parts, great.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's right, that's because this guy is begging to be differentiated, to be made simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>, and I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to use integration by parts.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And then <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer is now, <EXPRESSION> minus the integral of this guy.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "Which is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you are not done at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're still in slightly hot water.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're in tepid water, anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is it that you have to do here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're faced with this integral, which I'll put on the next board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a lot simpler than the other one, but as I say you're not quite out of the woods.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're faced with the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Trig substitution actually, interestingly, will work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that wasn't what I wanted you to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I wanted you to, yeah, go ahead.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Add and subtract <EXPRESSION> to the numerator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 48}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "So now, that's the correct answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the case where the numerator and the denominator are tied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you have to use long division.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "But a shortcut is just to observe that the result of long division is the same thing as doing this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then noticing that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the same as long division, in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because when you divide in, it goes in with a quotient of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "And so this guy turns out to be <EXPRESSION> the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is one extra step that you may be faced with someday in your life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just keep that in mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: We're starting a new unit today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so this is Unit 2, and it's called Applications of Differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the first application, and we're going to do two today, is what are known as linear approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whoops, that should have two p's in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that can be summarized with one formula, but it's going to take us at least half an hour to explain how this formula is used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION> is approximately = to its value at a base point plus the derivative times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 85}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 91}]}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the main formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put it in a box.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "And let me just describe what it means, first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I'll describe what it means again, and several other times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first of all, what it means is that if you have a curve, which is <EQUATION>, it's approximately the same as its tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this other side is the equation of the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's give an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take the function <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, and then its derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And, so let's take the base point <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "That's pretty much the only place where we know the logarithm for sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, what we plug in here now, are the values.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, sorry, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>, well, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we have an approximation formula which, if I copy down what's right up here, it's going to be <EXPRESSION> is approximately, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I plugged in here, for <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I evaluated the coefficients and this is the dependent variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, all told, if you like, what I have here is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me draw a picture of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I'll draw in the tangent line at the place that we're considering, which is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I've separated a little bit, but really I probably should have drawn it a little closer there, to show you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The whole point is that these two are nearby.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But they're not nearby everywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the line <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, that's the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They're nearby only when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So say in this little realm here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, this is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Once you get a little farther away, this straight line, this straight green line will separate from the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But near this place they're close together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the idea, again, is that the curve, the curved line, is approximately the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is one example of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so I want to explain this in one more way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we want to discuss it systematically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the second way that I want to describe this requires me to remind you what the definition of the derivative is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the definition of a derivative is that it's the limit, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>, that's one way of writing it, all right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the way we defined it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And one of the things that we did in the first unit was we looked at this backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We used the derivative knowing the derivatives of functions to evaluate some limits.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "So you were supposed to do that on your.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In our test, there were some examples there, at least one example, where that was the easiest way to do the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in other words, you can read this equation both ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is really, of course, the same equation written twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what's new about what we're going to do now is that we're going to take this expression here, <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to say well, when <EXPRESSION> is fairly near <EXPRESSION>, this expression is going to be fairly close to the limiting value.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 76}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "So this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that, I claim, is the same as what's in the box in pink that I have over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this approximation formula here is the same as this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an average rate of change, and this is an infinitesimal rate of change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they're nearly the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the claim.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you'll have various exercises in which this approximation is the useful one to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will, as I said, I'll be illustrating this a little bit today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me just explain why those two formulas in the boxes are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just start over here and explain that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the smaller box is the same thing if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now if I just write out what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to write it this way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I'm using the notations <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is the change in <EXPRESSION>, this is just rewriting what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the last step is just to put the constant on the other side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is exactly what I had just to begin with, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these two are just algebraically the same statement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one another way of looking at it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so now, I want to go through some systematic discussion here of several linear approximations, which you're going to be wanting to memorize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And rather than it's being hard to memorize these, it's supposed to remind you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that you'll have a lot of extra reinforcement in remembering derivatives of all kinds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when we carry out these systematic discussions, we want to make things absolutely as simple as possible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so one of the things that we do is we always use the base point to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm always going to have <EQUATION> in this standard list of formulas that I'm going to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I put <EQUATION>, then this formula becomes <EXPRESSION>, a little bit simpler to read.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "It becomes <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is probably the form that you'll want to remember most.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's again, just the linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But one always has to remember, and this is a very important thing, this one only worked near <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This approximation here really only works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's a little addition that you need to throw in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can't expect it to be true far away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The curve can go anywhere it wants, when it's far away from the point of tangency.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, OK, so let's work this out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do it for the sine function, for the cosine function, and for <EXPRESSION>, to begin with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When does this one work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so the question was, when does this one work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's actually the same as this one over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, that's what's going on when we take this limiting value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> going to <EXPRESSION> is the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So another way of saying it is, the <EXPRESSION> is small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, exactly what we mean by small will also be explained.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it is a matter to some extent of intuition as to how much, how good it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In practical cases, people will really care about how small it is before the approximation is useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's a serious issue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so let me carry out these approximations for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is always for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So all of these are going to be for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to make this computation, I have to evaluate the function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "I need to plug in two numbers here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "In order to get this expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is and I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is the function <EXPRESSION>, then I'm going to make a little table over to the right here with <EXPRESSION> and then I'm going to evaluate <EXPRESSION>, and then I'm going to evaluate <EXPRESSION>, and then read off what the answers are.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 139, "end_offset": 147}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 148, "end_offset": 160}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 184, "end_offset": 192}]}
{"text": "Right, so first of all if the function is <EXPRESSION>, the derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value of <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now we have the coefficients <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this number is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this number is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what we get here is <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the linear approximation to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, so now this is a routine matter to just read this off for this table.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll do it for the cosine function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate the cosine, what you get is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value of this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going back over here, <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This linear function happens to be constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, if I do need <EXPRESSION>, its derivative is again <EXPRESSION>, and its value at <EXPRESSION> is ,<EXPRESSION> the value of the derivative at <EXPRESSION> is also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So both of the terms here, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they're both <EXPRESSION> and we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the linear approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can memorize these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll probably remember them either this way or that way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This collection of information here encodes the same collection of information as we have over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the values of the function and the values of their derivatives at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just emphasize again the geometric point of view by drawing pictures of these results.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, for the sine function, here's the sine - well, close enough.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's - boy, now that is quite some sine, isn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should try to make the two bumps be the same height, roughly speaking.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway the tangent line we're talking about is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And near <EXPRESSION>, those things coincide pretty closely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cosine function, I'll put that underneath, I guess.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I can fit it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Make it a little smaller here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for the cosine function, we're up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, no wonder the tangent line is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's horizontal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The tangent line is horizontal, so the function corresponding is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And finally, if I draw <EQUATION>, that's coming down like this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And the tangent line is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value is <EXPRESSION> and the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is how to remember it graphically if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This analytic picture is extremely important and will help you to deal with sines, cosines and exponentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: The question is what do you normally use linear approximations for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're getting there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First, we're getting a little library of them and I'll give you a few examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now, I need to finish the catalog with two more examples which are just a little bit, slightly more challenging.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a little bit less obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the next couple that we're going to do are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, these are the last two that we're going to write down.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "And that you need to think about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the procedure is the same as over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"text": "And then I'll have the coefficients to be able to fill in what the approximation is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, in the case of the logarithm.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION>, if I plug in, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And f' if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "And similarly if I do it for this one, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I plug in <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And here I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the corresponding statement here is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> and here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, I do want to make a connection, explain to you what's going on here and the connection with the first example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We already did the logarithm once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's just point out that these two computations are the same, or practically the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here I use the base point <EXPRESSION>, but because of my, sort of, convenient form, which will end up, I claim, being much more convenient for pretty much every purpose, we want to do these things near <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "You cannot expand the logarithm and understand a tangent line for it at <EQUATION>, because it goes down to minus infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, if you try to graph <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> without the <EXPRESSION> here, you'll discover that sometimes the slope is infinite, and so forth.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "So this is a bad choice of point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "1 is a much better choice of a place to expand around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we shift things so that it looks like it's <EQUATION>, by shifting by the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So the connection with the previous example is that the-- what we wrote before I could write as <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "Right, that's just recopying what I have over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Except with the letter <EXPRESSION> rather than the letter <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I plug in, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And then that, if I copy it down, you see that I have a <EXPRESSION> in place of <EXPRESSION>, that's the same as this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "And if I write out <EXPRESSION>, if I subtract <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>, that means that it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "So that's what's on the right-hand side there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are the same computation, I've just changed the variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I want to try to address the question that was asked about how this is used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what the importance is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm going to do is just give you one example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then try to emphasize.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first way in which this is a useful idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, or maybe this is the second example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll call this Example 2, maybe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just take the logarithm of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take the logarithm of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I claim that, according to our rules, I can glance at this and I can immediately see that it's approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what did I use here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I used that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and the value of <EXPRESSION> that I used was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that is the formula, so I should put a box around these two formulas too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this formula here, applied with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm claiming that <EXPRESSION> is a sufficiently small number, sufficiently close to <EXPRESSION>, that this is an OK statement.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first question that I want to ask you is, which do you think is a more complicated thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The left-hand side or the right-hand side.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I claim that this is a more complicated thing, you'd have to go to a calculator to punch out and figure out what this thing is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know what a tenth is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the distinction that I want to make is that this half, this part, this is hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, that may look contradictory, but I want to just do it right above as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This looks uglier, but actually this is the hard one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is giving us information about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let me show you why that's true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Look down this column here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the hard ones, hard functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the easy functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's easier than this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nothing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, yeah, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over here it gets even worse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are the hard functions and these are the easy ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the main advantage of linear approximation is you get something much simpler to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you've made a valid approximation you can make much progress on problems.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, we'll be doing some more examples, but I saw some more questions before I made that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: Is this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: This is a parens there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, it's the digital number, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I've never used that before a decimal point, have I?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Other questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's continue here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give you some more examples, where it becomes even more vivid if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That this approximation is giving us something a little simpler to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's Example 3.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to, I'll find the linear approximation near <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "I also - when I write this expression near <EQUATION>, that's the same thing as this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "That's the same thing as saying <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> - of the function <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what I claim I want to use for the purposes of this approximation, are just the sum of the approximation formulas that we've already derived.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And just to combine them algebraically.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So I'm not going to do any calculus, I'm just going to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So with <EXPRESSION>, it's pretty clear that I should be using this formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the other one, it may be slightly less obvious but we have powers of <EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's plug those in.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "I'll put this up so that you can remember it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "And we're going to carry out this approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first of all, I'm going to write this so that it's slightly more suggestive.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "Namely, I'm going to write it as a product.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And there you can now see the exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this case, <EQUATION>, eh <EXPRESSION>, that we're going to use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I have <EXPRESSION>, and that's going to be approximately-- well I'm going to use this formula.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 88}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "I have to use it correctly.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "x is replaced by <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then over here, I can just copy verbatim the other approximation formula with <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "So this is times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to carry out the multiplication.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, here's our formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now this isn't where things stop.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, in this kind of arithmetic that I'm describing now, things are easier than they are in ordinary algebra, in arithmetic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The reason is that there's another step, which I'm now going to perform.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is that I'm going to throw away this term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to ignore it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "In fact, I didn't even have to work it out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I'm going to throw it away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the reason is that already, when I passed from this expression to this one, that is from this type of thing to this thing, I was already throwing away quadratic and higher-ordered terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this isn't the only quadratic term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are tons of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to ignore all of them if I'm going to ignore some of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, I only want to be left with the linear stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because that's all I'm really getting a valid computation for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is approximately <EXPRESSION> minus, so let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a total of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the linear part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> term is negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we drop <EXPRESSION> term.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "Terms, and higher.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of those terms should be lower-order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you imagine <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or maybe <EXPRESSION>, then these terms will end up being much smaller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have a rather crude approach.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's really the simplicity, and that's the savings.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, since this unit is called Applications, and these are indeed applications to math, I also wanted to give you a real-life application.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or a place where linear approximations come up in real life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So maybe we'll call this Example 4.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is supposedly a real-life example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll try to persuade you that it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I like this example because it's got a lot of math, as well as physics in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here I am, on the surface of the earth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here is a satellite going this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At some velocity, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this satellite has a clock on it because this is a GPS satellite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it has a time, <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have a watch, in fact it's right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have a time which I keep.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>, And there's an interesting relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is called time dilation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is from special relativity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's the following formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> is the velocity of the satellite, and <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'd like to get a rough idea of how different my watch is from the clock on the satellite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to use this same approximation, we've already used it once.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "But now let me just remind you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The situation here is, we have something of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what's happening when I multiply through here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in real life, of course, the expression that you're going to use the linear approximation on isn't necessarily itself linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It can be any physical quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this case it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately =, well again it's the same rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's an <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is approximately, by the same rule, this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> Now, I promised you that this would be a real-life problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the question is when people were designing these GPS systems, they run clocks in the satellites.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're down there, you're making your measurements, you're talking to the satellite by-- or you're receiving its signals from its radio.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The question is, is this going to cause problems in the transmission.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in this case, what actually happened is that <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how fast the GPS satellites actually go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they could've tweaked this if they had put them at different places.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, the speed of light is <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this number, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if you actually keep track of how much of an error that would make in a GPS location, what you would find is maybe it's a millimeter or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in fact it doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's nice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in fact the engineers who were designing these systems actually did use this very computation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Exactly this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way that they used it was, they decided that because the clocks were different, when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency, that frequency would be shifted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Would be offset.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of, exactly this, offset.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To compensate for the way the signal is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So from the point of view of good reception on your little GPS device, they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites, according to exactly this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And incidentally, the reason why they didn't-- they ignored higher-order terms, the sort of quadratic terms, is that if you take <EXPRESSION> that's a size <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 124, "end_offset": 128}]}
{"text": "And that really is totally negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That doesn't matter to any measurement at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's on the order of nanometers, and it's not important for any of the uses to which GPS is put.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's a real example of a use of linear approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So.", "entities": []}
{"text": "let's take a little pause here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to switch gears and talk about quadratic approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But before I do that, let's have some more questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: OK, so the question was asked, suppose I did this by different method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose I applied the original formula here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, I define the function <EXPRESSION>, which was this function here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "And then I plugged in its value at <EQUATION> and the value of its derivative at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the answer is, yes, it's also true that if I call this function <EXPRESSION>, then it must be true that the linear approximation is <EXPRESSION> of - I'm sorry, it's at <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that should be true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula that we're using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's up there in the pink also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, what about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's no surprise.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what I got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I computed <EXPRESSION>, by the product rule it would be an annoying, somewhat long, computation.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "And because of what we just done, we know what it has to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because this is a shortcut for doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is faster than doing that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, that's a legal way of doing it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you get to second derivatives, you'll quickly discover that this method that I've just described is complicated, but far superior to differentiating this expression twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "entities": []}
{"text": "JERISON: Would you have to throw away an <EXPRESSION> term if you differentiated?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in fact, we didn't really have to do that here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you differentiate and then plug in <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So if you differentiate this and you plug in <EQUATION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "You differentiate this and you plug in <EQUATION>, this term still drops out because it's just a <EXPRESSION> when you differentiate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 132}]}
{"text": "And then you plug in <EQUATION>, it's gone too.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And similarly, if you're up here, it goes away and similarly over here it goes away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the higher-order terms never influence this computation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This just captures the linear features of the function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I want to go on to quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we're going to elaborate on this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that should have been linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Liner.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that was wrong.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now we're going to change it to quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, suppose we talk about a quadratic approximation here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the quadratic approximation is going to be just an elaboration, one more step of detail.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From the linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, it's an extension of the linear approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we're adding one more term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the extra term turns out to be related to the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the formula for the quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this chunk of it, of course, is the linear part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This time I'll spell 'linear' correctly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the linear part is the first piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the quadratic part is the second piece.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to develop this same catalog of functions as I had before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, I want to extend our formulas to the higher-order terms.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "And if you do that for this example here, maybe I'll even illustrate with this example before I go on, if you do it with this example here, just to give you a flavor for what goes on, what turns out to be the case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the linear version.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'm going to compare it to the quadratic version.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So the quadratic version turns out to be this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what turns out to be the quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I use this example here, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is the same as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that turns out, instead of being <EXPRESSION>, that's point, what is it, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little bit less.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, but it's pretty close.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if you like, the correction is lower in the decimal expansion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now let me actually check a few of these.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll carry them out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And what I'm going to probably save for next time is explaining to you, so this is why this factor of <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to do this later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do this next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can certainly do well to stick with this presentation for one more lecture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can see this reinforced.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm going to work out these derivatives of the higher-order terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let me do it for the <EXPRESSION> approximately <EXPRESSION> case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, I want to add in the extra term here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "Here's the extra term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the quadratic part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now in order to figure out what's going on, I'm going to need to compute, also, second derivatives.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 76}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 102}]}
{"text": "So here I need a second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I need to throw in the value of that second derivative at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "So this is what I'm going to need to compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I do it, for example, for the sine function, I already have the linear part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need this last bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I differentiate the sine function twice and I get, I claim minus the sine function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "The first derivative is the cosine and the cosine derivative is minus the sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, I get, lo and behold, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So actually the quadratic approximation is the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's no <EXPRESSION> term here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why this is such a terrific approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also the quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the cosine function, if you differentiate twice, you get the derivative is minus the sign and derivative of that is minus the cosine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I evaluate that at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And so the term that I have to plug in here, this <EXPRESSION> is the coefficient that appears right here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I need a <EXPRESSION> extra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you do it for the <EXPRESSION>, you get an <EXPRESSION>, and you got a <EXPRESSION> and so you get <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to finish these two in just a second, but I first want to tell you about the geometric significance of this quadratic term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Geometric significance (of the quadratic term).", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the geometric significance is best to describe just by drawing a picture here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to draw the picture of the cosine function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "And remember we already had the tangent line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the tangent line was this horizontal here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that was <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But you can see intuitively, that doesn't even tell you whether this function is above or below <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Doesn't tell you much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's sort of begging for there to be a little more information to tell us what the function is doing nearby.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And indeed, that's what this second expression does for us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's some kind of parabola underneath here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is a much better fit to the curve than the horizontal line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is, if you like, this is the best fit parabola.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be the closest parabola to the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's more or less the significance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's much, much closer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, I want to give you, well, I think we'll save these other derivations for next time because I think we're out of time now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we'll do these next time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: Well, because our subject today is trig integrals and substitutions, Professor Jerison called in his substitute teacher for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor Miller.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to try to tell you about trig substitutions and trig integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll be here tomorrow to do more of the same, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is about trigonometry, and maybe first thing I'll do is remind you of some basic things about trigonometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if I have a circle, trigonometry is all based on the circle of radius 1 and centered at the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if this is an angle of <EXPRESSION>, up from the x-axis, then the coordinates of this point are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that leads right away to some trig identities, which you know very well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to put them up here because we'll use them over and over again today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember the convention <EXPRESSION> secretly means <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It would be more sensible to write a parenthesis around the <EXPRESSION> and then say you square that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "But everybody in the world puts the <EXPRESSION> up there over the <EXPRESSION>, and so I'll do that too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that follows just because the circle has radius <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then there are some other identities too, which I think you remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll write them down here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, there's this double angle formula that says <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's also the double angle formula for the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember what that says?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to use these trig identities and I'm going to use them in a slightly different way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And so I'd like to pay a little more attention to this one and get a different way of writing this one out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is actually the half angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that says, I'm going to try to express the <EXPRESSION> in terms of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "So if I know the <EXPRESSION>, I want to try to express the <EXPRESSION> in terms of it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "Well, I'll start with a <EXPRESSION> and play with that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we also know what the <EXPRESSION> is in terms of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can eliminate the <EXPRESSION> from this picture.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I put in what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION> And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "There's this <EXPRESSION>, which gets a plus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because of these two minus signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's the one that was there before, so altogether there are two of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to isolate what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "Or rather, what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's solve for that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So I'll put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I want to divide by this <EXPRESSION>, and so that puts a <EXPRESSION> in this denominator here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "So some people call that the half angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What it really is for us is it's a way of eliminating powers from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've gotten rid of this square at the expense of putting in a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll use that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, similarly, same calculation shows that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same <EXPRESSION>, in that formula also, but it has a minus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that's my little review of trig identities that we'll make use of as this lecture goes on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to talk about trig identity-- trig integrals, and you know some trig integrals, I'm sure, already.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like, well, let me write the differential form first.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "You know that <EXPRESSION>, or maybe I'll say <EXPRESSION>, is, let's see, that's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so if I integrate both sides here, the integral form of this is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "And in the same way, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I integrate that, I find the integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So that's our starting point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the game today, for the first half of the lecture, is to use that basic-- just those basic integration formulas, together with clever use of trig identities in order to compute more complicated formulas involving trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first thing, the first topic, is to think about integrals of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where here I have in mind <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are non-negative integers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's try to integrate these.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "I'll show you some applications of these pretty soon.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Looking down the road a little bit, integrals like this show up in Fourier series and many other subjects in mathematics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It turns out they're quite important to be able to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's why we're doing them now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so there are two cases to think about here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you're integrating things like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the easy case, and let's do that one first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The easy case is when at least one exponent is odd.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the easy case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, suppose that I wanted to integrate, well, let's take the case <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "So I'm integrating <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm taking-- Oh, I could do that one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if that's what I want to take.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "My confusion is that I meant to have this a different power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You were thinking that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do this case when <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the integral I'm trying to do is any power of the <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "Well, here's the trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Recognize, use this formula up at the top there to see <EXPRESSION> as something that we already have on the blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the way to exploit that is to make a substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And substitution is going to be <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's why.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then this integral that I'm trying to do is the integral of <EXPRESSION>, that's already a simplification.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you make a substitution, you've got to go all the way and replace everything in the expression by things involving this new variable that I've introduced.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'd better get rid of the <EXPRESSION> and rewrite it in terms of <EXPRESSION> or in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "And I can do that because <EXPRESSION>, according to that formula, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me put a box around that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's our substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you make a substitution, you also want to compute the differential of the variable that you substitute in.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 54}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 107}]}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> that appears here is just, exactly, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I've replaced this trig integral with something that doesn't involve trig functions at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a lot easier.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can just plug into what we know here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant, and I've done the integral.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "But I'm not quite done with the problem yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because to be nice to your reader and to yourself, you should go back at this point, probably, go back and get rid of this new variable that you introduced.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're the one who introduced this variable, you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Nobody except you, really, knows what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the rest of the world knows what they asked for the first place that involved <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I have to go back and get rid of this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And that's not hard to do in this case, because <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I make this back substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the game was, I use this odd power of the <EXPRESSION> here, and I could see it appearing as the differential of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So that's what made this substitution work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another example to see how that works out in a slightly different case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I do have an odd power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One of the exponents is odd, so I'm in the easy case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The game now is to use this trig identity to get rid of the largest even power that you can, from this odd power here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So use <EQUATION>, to eliminate a lot of powers from that odd power.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "Watch what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is not really a substitution or anything, this is just a trig identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have the remaining <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me rewrite that a little bit to see how this works out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "This is the integral of <EXPRESSION> minus, and then there's the product of these two.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm really exactly in the situation that I was in over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got a single power of a <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It happens that it's a sine here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's not going to cause any trouble, we can go ahead and play the same game that I did there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, so far I've just been using trig identities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now I'll use a trig substitution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "And I think I want to write these as powers of a variable.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "And then this is going to be the differential of that variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll take <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>, and that means that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "There's the substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when I make that substitution, what do we get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> becomes not quite <EXPRESSION>, watch for the signum, watch for this minus sign here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The minus sign comes outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can integrate both of these powers, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "And then this 4th power gives me a 5th power, when I integrate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "And don't forget the constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Am I done?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not quite done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to back substitute and get rid of my choice of variable, <EXPRESSION>, and replace it with yours.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 89}]}
{"text": "Questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: There should indeed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I forgot this minus sign when I came down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these two gang up to give me a plus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Was that what the other question was about, too?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's back substitute.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "And I'm going to put that over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the result is, well, I just replace the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus, thank you, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And there's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "By the way, you can remember one of the nice things about doing an integral is it's fairly easy to check your answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can always differentiate the thing you get, and see whether you get the right thing when you go back.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "It's not too hard to use the power rules and the differentiation rule for the <EXPRESSION> to get back to this if you want to check the work.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "Let's do one more example, just to handle an example of this easy case, which you might have thought of at first.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Suppose I just want to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No <EXPRESSION> in sight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I do have an odd power of a trig function, of a <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm in the easy case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the procedure that I was suggesting says I want to take out the largest even power that I can, from the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll take that out, that's a <EXPRESSION>, and write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "Well, now I'm very happy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's just like the situation we had somewhere on the board here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just like the situation we had up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got a power of a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So exactly the same substitution steps in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get, and maybe you can see what happens without doing the work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Shall I do the work here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I make the same substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But then I want to put this minus sign in place, and so that gives me <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"text": "And then I back substitute and get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "So this is the easy case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you have some odd power to play with, then you can make use of it and it's pretty straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK the harder case is when you don't have an odd power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the program?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to do the harder case, and then I'm going to show you an example of how to integrate square roots.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 94}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 107}]}
{"text": "And do an application, using these ideas from trigonometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to keep this blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll come back and start here again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the harder case is when they're only even exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm still trying to integrate the same form.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "But now all the exponents are even.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have to do some game.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here the game is use the half angle formula.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "Which I just erased, very sadly, on the board here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll rewrite them over here so we have them on the board.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "I think I remember what they were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the game is I'm going to use that half angle formula to start getting rid of those even powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Half angle formula written like this, exactly, talks about-- it rewrites even powers of sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see how that works out in an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about just the <EXPRESSION> for a start.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What to do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can't pull anything out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>, but then I'd be faced with integrating the <EXPRESSION>, which is exactly as hard.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "So instead, let's use this formula here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "This is really the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, this is easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's got two parts to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Integrating <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION> over-- Oh.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Miraculously, the <EXPRESSION> turned into a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's put it back as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION> by integrating <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So, notice that something non-trigonometric occurs here when I do these even integrals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> appears.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the other one, OK, so this takes a little thought.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, or is it minus the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Shall we take a vote?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think it's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so you get <EXPRESSION>, but is that right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, this <EXPRESSION> comes out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And would give me an extra <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an extra <EXPRESSION> that I have to put in here when I integrate it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 51}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "And there's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is not a substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just played with trig identities here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then did a simple trig integral, getting your help to get the sign right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And thinking about what this <EXPRESSION> is going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It produces a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's not applying any complicated thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just using this identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do another example that's a little bit harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This time, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, no odd powers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got to work a little bit harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm going to do is apply those identities up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what I recommend doing in this situation is going over to the side somewhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And do some side work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's all just playing with trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not actually doing any integrals for a while.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I guess one way to get rid of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> is to use those identities and so let's do that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just substitute them in.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "And now I can multiply that out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "And what I have is a difference times a sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you know a formula for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Taking the product of these two things, well there'll be a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the numerator, I get the square of this minus the square of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "= - So I get that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'm a little bit happier, because at least I don't have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have <EXPRESSION> different squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I still have a square, and want to integrate this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "I'm still not in the easy case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I got myself back to an easier hard case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we do know what to do about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I just did it up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I could play into this formula that we got.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think it's just as easy to continue to calculate here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "Use the half angle formula again for this, and continue on your way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get a <EXPRESSION> from this bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I plug in <EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION>, there in the top board, I'm going to get a <EXPRESSION> on the right-hand side.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "So it comes out like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I guess I could simplify that a little bit more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, but then there's a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's half that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So then I can simplify a little more.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's my side work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just did some trig identities over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And rewrote <EXPRESSION> as something which involves just no powers of trig, just <EXPRESSION> by itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can take that and substitute it in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now the integration is pretty easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is, OK the <EXPRESSION> is going to give me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral or <EXPRESSION> is plus or minus the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is plus the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "So it's going to be plus the-- Only there's a minus here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going to be the <EXPRESSION>, but then I have an additional factor in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's it going to be?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to put a <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "So we've done that calculation, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So any of these-- If you keep doing this kind of process, these two kinds of procedures, you can now integrate any expression that has a power of a <EXPRESSION> times a power of a <EXPRESSION> in it, by using these ideas.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 110}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"text": "Now, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, let me give you an alternate method for this last one here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I know what I'll do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give an alternate method for doing, really doing the side work over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm trying to deal with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's the square of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> shows up right here.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "In another trig identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we can make use of that, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That reduces the number of factors of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's going in the right direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>-- Say this right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and then I want to square that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "So what I get is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is, well, I'm not too happy yet, because I still have an even power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember I'm trying to integrate this thing in the end, even powers are bad.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I try to get rid of them.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "By using that formula, the half angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can apply that to <EXPRESSION> here again.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the half angle formula says for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's exactly the same as the expression that I got up here, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same expression that I have there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's the same expression as I have here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is just an alternate way to play this game of using the half angle formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let's do a little application of these things and change the topic a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is an application and example of a real trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's the problem I want to look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I have a circle whose radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I cut out from it a sort of tab, here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This tab here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the height of this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this length is a number <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I want to do is compute the area of that little tab.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "That's the problem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an arc over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I want to find the area of this, for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area, well, I guess one way to compute the area would be to take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "You've seen the idea of splitting this up into vertical strips whose height is given by a function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you integrate that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "That's an interpretation for the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The area is given by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's a little bit awkward, because my formula for <EXPRESSION> is going to be a little strange.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's constant, value of <EXPRESSION>, along here, and then at this point it becomes this arc, of the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So working this out, I could do it but it's a little awkward because expressing <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>, the top edge of this shape, it's a little awkward, and takes two different regions to express.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a different way to say it is to say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe that'll work a little bit better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or maybe it won't, but it's worth trying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could just as well split this region up into horizontal strips.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whose width is <EXPRESSION>, and whose length is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I'm thinking of this as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the graph of a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's much better, because the function of <EXPRESSION> is, well, it's the square root of <EXPRESSION>, isn't it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what I'm asked to integrate, then.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "Square root of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can even put in limits of integration.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "Maybe I should do that, because this is supposed to be an actual number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess I'm integrating it from <EQUATION>, that's here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is what I want to find.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a integral formula for the area of that region.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is a new form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't think that you've thought about integrating expressions like this in this class before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a new form and I want to show you how to do it, how it's related to trigonometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's related to trigonometry through that exact picture that we have on the blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After all, this <EXPRESSION> is the formula for this arc.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, what I propose is that we try to exploit the connection with the circle and introduce polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here if I measure this angle then there are various things you can say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like the coordinates of this point here are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>-- Well, I'm sorry, it's not.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's an angle, but I want to call it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "And, in general you know that the coordinates of this point are (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the radius is <EXPRESSION>, then the angle here is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, just from looking at the geometry of the circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's make that substitution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm using the picture to suggest that maybe making the substitution is a good thing to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's follow along and see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If that's true, what we're interested in is integrating, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>-- We're interested in integrating the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the <EXPRESSION> minus this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's just <EQUATION>, all over again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's also <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are a lot of different ways to think of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But no matter how you say it, the thing we're trying to integrate, <EXPRESSION> is, under this substitution it is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "So I'm interested in integrating the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm going to make this substitution <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so under that substitution, I've decided that the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I'd better compute the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>, just differentiating this expression, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's put that in.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Making that trig substitution, <EXPRESSION>, has replaced this integral that has a square root in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And no trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "With an integral that involves no square roots and only trig functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it's not too hard to integrate this now, because of the work that we've done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> comes out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And maybe we've done that example already today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think we have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe we can think it through, but maybe the easiest thing is to look back at notes and see what we got before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was the first example in the hard case that I did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what it came out to, I used <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION> at the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a good step forward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I started with this integral that I really didn't know how to do by any means that we've had so far.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I've replaced it by a trig integral that we do know how to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I've done that trig integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we're still not quite done, because of the problem of back substituting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'd like to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, I'd like to go back and rewrite it in terms of the original limits of integration that we had in the original problem.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "In doing that, it's going to be useful to rewrite this expression and get rid of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "After all, the original <EXPRESSION> was expressed in terms of <EXPRESSION>, not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me just do that here, and say that this, in turn, = <EXPRESSION> plus, well, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "And so, when there's a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, what I'll get is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I did that because I'm getting closer to the original terms that the problem started with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me write down the integral that we have now.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is, so far, what we know is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I want to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original value.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "The original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what is <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION> was given like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what is <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here the fearsome <EXPRESSION> rears its head, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the angle so that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> inverse, of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the first thing that shows up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, all over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this term.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the other side, here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, we knew what they were in terms of <EXPRESSION> and in terms of <EXPRESSION>, if you like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll put the <EXPRESSION> inside here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "That makes it a little bit nicer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus, and the other term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "So the a <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll write this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And so I get the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now here <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, or, if you like, it's the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so there I've rewritten everything, back in terms of the original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's an answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've done this indefinite integration of a form-- of this quadratic, this square root of something which is a constant minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 113, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "Whenever you see that, the thing to think of is trigonometry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to play into the <EXPRESSION> identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the way to exploit it is to make the substitution <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could also make a substitution <EQUATION>, if you wanted to.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "And the result would come out to exactly the same in the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm still not quite done with the original problem that I had, because the original problem asked for a definite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just go back and finish that as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the area was the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of this square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just want to evaluate the right-hand side here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "The answer that we came up with, this indefinite integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, times the <EXPRESSION>, putting <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "So I've plugged in <EQUATION> into that formula, this is what I get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then when I plug in <EQUATION>, well the, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this term goes away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when <EQUATION>, this term is <EXPRESSION> also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I don't get any subtracted terms at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an expression for this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Notice that this <EXPRESSION>, that's exactly this angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, it's the angle that you get when <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put this over here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That is the angle that the corner makes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Let's just think about this for a minute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have these two terms in the sum, is that reasonable?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The first term is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the radius squared times this angle, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I think that is exactly the area of this sector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the formula for the area of the sector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this one, this is the vertical elevation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the horizontal.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is this distance.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the right-hand term is <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, that's the area of that triangle.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "So using a little bit of geometry gives you the same answer as all of this elaborate calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe that's enough cause for celebration for us to quit for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We hopefully know at this point what a differential equation is, so now let's try to solve some.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this first class of differential equations I'll introduce you to, they're called separable equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think what you'll find is that we're not learning really anything new.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Using just your first year calculus derivative and integrating skills, you can solve a separable equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason why they're called separable is because you can actually separate the x and y terms, and integrate them separately to get the solution of the differential equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 80}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 98}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 113}]}
{"text": "So that's separable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Separable equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do a couple, and I think you'll get the point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These often are really more of exercises in algebra than anything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first separable differential equation is: <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, this is a good time to just review our terminology.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So first of all, what is the order of this differential equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the highest derivative in it is just the first derivative, so the order = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's first order.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's ordinary, because we only have a regular derivative, no partial derivatives here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, is this linear or non-linear?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, first you say, oh well, you know, this looks linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not multiplying the derivative times anything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you look carefully, something interesting is going on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, you have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is a dependent variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to have the <EXPRESSION>, that makes it non-linear.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And even if this was <EXPRESSION>, if you were to actually multiply both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, and get in the form that I showed you in the previous equation, you would have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 95}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "This is actually the first step of what we have to do anyways, so I'll write it down.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "So if I'm just multiplying both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 54}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "And then you immediately see that even if this wasn't a squared here, you'd be multiplying the <EXPRESSION>, and that also makes it non-linear because you're multiplying the dependent variable times the derivative of itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that also makes this a non-linear equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, let's get back to solving this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the first step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "And the real end goal is just to separate the y's and the x's, and then integrate both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "So I'm almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now what I want to do is I want to multiply both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, so I have a <EXPRESSION> here and get rid of this <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "Let me go here, I don't want to waste too much space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have separated the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> variables and the differentials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All I did is I multiplied both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION> to get here.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "Now, I can just integrate both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whatever you do to one side of the equation you have to do the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's true with regular equations or differential equations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we're going to integrate both sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's the integral of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, the integral of <EXPRESSION>, well that's minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "And I'll write the plus <EXPRESSION> here just to kind of show you something, but you really don't have to write <EXPRESSION> on both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "I'll call the plus the constant due to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll never see this in a calculus class, but I just want to make a point here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just want to show you that our plus c has never disappeared from when we were taking our traditional antiderivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what's the derivative of this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is also going to have <EXPRESSION> due to the <EXPRESSION> variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the reason why I did this magenta one in magenta and I labelled it like that, is because you really just have to write <EXPRESSION> on one side of the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 123}]}
{"text": "And if that doesn't make a lot of sense, let's subtract this <EXPRESSION> from both sides, and we get <EXPRESSION> minus-- let me scroll down a little bit, my <EXPRESSION> looks like a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION> plus the constant when we took the antiderivative of the <EXPRESSION>, minus the constant of the antiderivative when we took the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 122}]}
{"text": "But these two constants, they're just constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, we don't know what they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are arbitrary constants.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could just write a general <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you could have just-- you have to have a constant, but it doesn't have to be on both sides of the equation, because they're arbitrary.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, well, that's still just another constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then if we want to simplify this equation more, we can multiply both sides of this by <EXPRESSION>, just make it look nicer.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "And you get <EQUATION> plus-- well, I could write <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "But once again, <EXPRESSION> is an arbitrary constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> times an arbitrary constant, that's just another arbitrary constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll write the <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "And there you have it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have solved this differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Although it is in implicit form right now, and it's fairly hard to get it out of implicit form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We could put the <EXPRESSION> on one side, so the solution could be <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Some people might like that little bit better.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's the solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And notice, the solution, just like when you take an antiderivative, the solution is a class of implicit functions, in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And why is it a class?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because we have that constant there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Depending on what number you pick there, it will be another solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But any constant there will satisfy the original differential equation, which was up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This was the original differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if you want to solve for that constant, someone has to give you an initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Someone has to say, well, when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you could solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, let's do another one that gives us an initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one's a little bit-- I'll start over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Clear image, different colors, so I have optimal space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this one is the first derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a parentheses, not an absolute value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they give us initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They say that <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So once we solve this differential equation, and this is a separable differential equation, then we can use this initial condition, when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, to figure out the constant.", "entities": []}

{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I won't write the <EXPRESSION>, I'll just do it on the right hand side.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}

{"text": "But we can solve for <EXPRESSION> using the initial condition <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's put <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>, so we get <EXPRESSION>, that's the value of <EXPRESSION>, = when <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So when <EQUATION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is fairly straightforward.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of these, this is all <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is, let's see, <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's plus <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And we get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the implicit exact solution, the solution of our differential equation-- remember now, it's not a class, because they gave us an initial condition-- is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We figured out that's what <EXPRESSION> was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And actually, if you want, you could write this in an explicit form by completing the square.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "This is just algebra this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You're done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is an implicit form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you wanted to make it explicit, you could add <EXPRESSION> to both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "I'm just completing the square here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I add <EXPRESSION> to that side, I have to add <EXPRESSION> to this side, so it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "I just added <EXPRESSION> to both sides of the equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why did I do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I wanted this side to be a perfect square in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then I can rewrite this side as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "Then I could say <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can add <EXPRESSION> to both sides, and then I can get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "And it has plus or minus here, and if we have to pick one of the two, we'd go back to the initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, our initial condition told us that <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if we put <EXPRESSION> here for <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> plus or minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is going to be = negative <EXPRESSION>, so we get <EQUATION>-- sorry, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>, then this has to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the explicit form that satisfies our initial condition, and we're getting a little geeky here, you could get rid of the plus, it's 1 minus this whole thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what satisfies our initial condition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you could figure out where it's satisfied, over what domain is it satisfied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's satisfied when this term is positive, this becomes negative, and you get it's undefined in reals, and all of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But anyway, I've run out of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: So we're going to continue to talk about trig integrals and trig substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is maybe the most technical part of this course, which maybe is why professor Jerison decided to just take a leave, go AWOL just now and let me take over for him.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'll do my best to help you learn this technique and it'll be useful for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've talked about trig integrals involving sines and cosines yesterday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's another whole world out there that involves these other trig polynomials-- trig functions, secant and tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me just make a little table to remind you what they are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I have trouble remembering myself, so I enjoy the opportunity to go back to remind myself of this stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The secant is one over one of those things, which one is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's weird, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course the tangent, we know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the <EXPRESSION> over the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> is the other way around.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you put a 'co' in front of it, it exchanges <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "Well, I have a few identities involving tangent and secant up there, in that little prepared blackboard up above.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I'll just go through and check that out to make sure that we're all on the same page with them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to claim that there's this trig identity at the top.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just check that out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then whenever you see a <EXPRESSION> in trigonometry, you'll always have the option of writing as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And if I do that, then I can divide the <EXPRESSION> into that first term.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there you go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That checks the first one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the main trig identity that's going to be behind what I talk about today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the trigonometry identity part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about this piece of calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can we calculate what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "Actually, I'm going to do that on this board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I think I was with you when we learned about the quotient rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "Computing the derivative of a quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the rule is, you take the numerator and you-- sorry, you take the derivative of the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "And you multiply it by the denominator, so that gives you <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And then you take the numerator, take minus the numerator, and multiply that by the derivative of the denominator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 37}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "And you put all that over the square of the denominator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "And now I look at that and before my eyes I see the same trig identity, <EQUATION>, appearing there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what the claim was.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That immediately gives you an integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, the integral of <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the fundamental theorem of calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we verified the first integral there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's just do the second one as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if I want to differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, I have a quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one's a little easier because the numerator's so simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I take the derivative of the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "And then I take the numerator, I take minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 37}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 63}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>, and put all that over the square of the same denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So one minus sign came from the quotient rule, and the other one came because that's the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "But they cancel, and so I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> and so that's the <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, not hard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That verifies that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it tells you that the integral of that weird thing in case you ever want to know, the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there are a couple more integrals that I want to do for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where I can't sort of work backwards like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's calculate the integral of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "Just do this straight out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now there's a habit of mind, that I hope you get into.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When you see the <EXPRESSION> and you're calculating an integral like this, it's useful to remember what the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because maybe it shows up somewhere else in the integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that happens here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that suggests we make a substitution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Which means <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the numerator, except for the minus sign.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I can rewrite this as, under the substitution, I can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>, that's the numerator, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 152}]}
{"text": "Well, I know how to do that integral too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That gives me the natural log, doesn't it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "I'm not quite done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have to back-substitute and replace this new variable that I've made up, called <EXPRESSION>, with what it is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "And what you get is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, you find these tables of integrals in the back of the book.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Things like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not sure how much memorization Professor Jerison is going to ask of you, but there is a certain amount of memorization that goes on in calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is one of the kinds of things that you probably want to know.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do one more integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think I'm making my way through a prepared board here, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'd also like to know what the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't know a way to kind of go straight at this, but let me show you a way to think your way through to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take these two facts, <EXPRESSION> is what it is, and <EXPRESSION> is what it is, and add them together, I get this fact.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "That the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is, well, it's the sum of these two things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's a <EXPRESSION> that occurs in both of those terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll factor it out.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "And that gives me, I'll put it over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the <EXPRESSION> that occurs in both terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in one term, there's another <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And in the other term, there's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's interesting somehow, because this same term appears on both sides of this equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write <EXPRESSION>, for that <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "And so the equation that I get is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've just made a direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just decide that I'm going to write <EXPRESSION> for that single thing that occurs on both sides of the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is on the left, and <EXPRESSION> is on the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there's my secant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That I was trying to integrate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And what it tells you is that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and I get this equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, that has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Not sure that professor Jerison's used this in this class, but <EXPRESSION>, we've actually used something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's on the board right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a logarithmic derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe it's easier to read this from right to left, if I want to calculate the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, well, the chain rule says I get the derivative of <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 73}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 91}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 126}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 137}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 138, "end_offset": 155}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 169, "end_offset": 174}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 175, "end_offset": 192}]}
{"text": "So often <EXPRESSION> is called the logarithmic derivative.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "But it's done what I wanted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it's expressed the secant as a derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I guess I should put in what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that implies that the integral-- Integrate both sides.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "That says that the integral of <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the last line in this little memo that I created.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That we can use now for the rest of the class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions about that trick?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a trick, I have nothing more to say about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the next thing I-- oh yes, so now I want to make the point that using these rules and some thought, you can now integrate most trigonometric polynomials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Most things that involve powers of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and everything else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, let's try to integrate the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Big power of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there are too many <EXPRESSION> there for me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's take some away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I can take them away by using that trig identity, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to replace two of those <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "That leaves me with two left over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now there was method to my madness.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I've got a <EXPRESSION> left over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that suggests a substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, let's say, let's let <EQUATION>, so that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "And I have both terms that occur in my integral sitting there very nicely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the possibility of making this substitution and seeing a secant squared up here as part of the differential here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why it was a good idea for me to take two of the <EXPRESSION> and write them as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "So now I can continue this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Under that substitution, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh yeah, and I should add the other fact, that-- Well I guess it's obvious that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION>, that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well that's pretty easy to integrate.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "And then I just have to back-substitute.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "Put things back in terms of the original variables.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "And that gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's the answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could spend a lot more time doing more examples of this kind of polynomial trig thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's probably best for you to do some practice on your own.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because I want to talk about other things, also.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I want to talk about is the use of these trig identities in making really trig substitution integration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we did a little bit of this yesterday, and I'll show you some more examples today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's start with a pretty hard example right off the bat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is going to be the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a pretty bad looking integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how can we approach this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the square root is the ugliest part of the integral, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What we should try to do is write this square root in some nicer way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "That is, figure out a way to write <EXPRESSION> as a square.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "That'll get rid of the square root.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "So there is an example of a way to write <EXPRESSION> plus something squared in a different way.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "And it's right up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to use that idea.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I see this form, that suggests that we make a trig substitution and write <EXPRESSION> as the <EXPRESSION> of some new variable.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "Which you might as well call <EXPRESSION>, to because it's like an angle.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "Then <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "According to that trig identity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this identity is the reason that the substitution is going to help us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because it gets rid of the square root and replaces it by some other trig function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'd better be able to get rid of the <EXPRESSION>, too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's part of the substitution process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But we can do that, because I know what the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just substitute all of that stuff in, and rewrite the entire integral in terms of our new variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is in the numerator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then the denominator, well, it has an <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then there's this square root.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we know what that is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "we've done the trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've gotten rid of the square root, I've got everything in terms of trig functions of the new variable.", "entities": []}

{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to put a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "Oh, I guess the first thing I can do is cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's clever.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You were all thinking that too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Cancel those.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I just get <EXPRESSION> denominator from <EXPRESSION> there in the numerator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "It's still pretty complicated, <EXPRESSION>, who knows.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we'll find out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I should put a <EXPRESSION> where the <EXPRESSION> was, and <EXPRESSION> up there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "And I still have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now you see some more cancellation occurs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the virtue of writing things out in this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, the square here cancels with this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a little simpler.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it puts me in a position to use the same idea I just used.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see the <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I might look around in this integral to see if its derivative occurs anywhere.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The differential of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I'm very much inclined to make another substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say, <EXPRESSION>, direct substitution this time.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Say, <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Yes sir.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Because I want to see <EXPRESSION> appear up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I'd had a <EXPRESSION> up here, that would be a signal to me that maybe I should say let <EXPRESSION> be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Also, because this thing in the denominator is something I want to get rid of.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's in the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'll get rid of it by wishful thinking and just call it something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It works pretty well in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wishful thinking doesn't always work so well.", "entities": []}

{"text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}

{"text": "I don't know what the <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}

{"text": "OK, so undoing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Trig subs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's go back to where trigonometry always comes from, this right angled triangle.", "entities": []}

{"text": "This one's called the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one is called the <EXPRESSION>, and that one's called the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, let's find out where <EXPRESSION> lies in this triangle.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Let's try to write the sides of this triangle in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "And what I know is, <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the tangent of <EXPRESSION>, tangent of this angle, is opposite divided by adjacent.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "Did you learn SOH CAH TOA?", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "OK, so it's opposite divided by adjacent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is the tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there are different ways to do that, but why not just do it in the simplest way and suppose that the adjacent is <EXPRESSION>, and the opposite is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is correct now, isn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get the correct value for the tangent of theta by saying that the lengths of those are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that means that the hypotenuse has length <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, here's a triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm interested in computing the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where's that appear in the triangle?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is opposite over hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the hypotenuse is <EXPRESSION>, and the opposite is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I've done it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've undone the trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've figured out what this cosecant of <EXPRESSION> is, in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so the final answer is minus the <EXPRESSION>, plus a constant, and there's an answer to the original problem.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "This took two boards to go through this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I illustrated several things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, this three half boards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I illustrated this use of trig substitution, and I'll come back to that in a second.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I illustrated patience.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I illustrated rewriting things in terms of sines and cosines, and then making a direct substitution to evaluate an integral like this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "And then there's this undoing all of those substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it culminated with undoing the trig sub.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's play a game here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why don't we play the game where you give me-- So, there's a step in here that I should have done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should've said this is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "The most straightforward thing you can do is to say since <EXPRESSION> is the tangent of <EXPRESSION>, that means that-- sorry, if <EXPRESSION>, that means that <EXPRESSION> is the arctangent of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so let's just put in <EXPRESSION> as the arctangent of <EXPRESSION>, and that's what you get.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "So really, what I just did for you was to show you a way to compute some trig function applied to the inverse of another trig function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "I computed cosecant of the arctangent by this trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let's play the game where you give me a trig function and an inverse trig function, and I try to compute what the composite is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So who can give me a trig function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Has to be one of these standard ones.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: Tan.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: Tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Alright.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about another one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "PROFESSOR: <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do we have agreement on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Right, <EXPRESSION> has the best cheer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the game.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have to compute, try to compute, that composite.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "Something wrong with this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: What does acceptable mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Don't you think-- so the question is, isn't this a perfectly acceptable final answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a correct final answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is much more insightful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And after all the original thing was involving square roots and things, this is the kind of thing you might hope for is an answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just a nicer answer for sure.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And likely to be more useful to you when you go on and use that answer for something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's try to do this this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Undo a trig substitution that involved a cosecant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "And I manipulate around, and I find myself trying to find out what's the tangent of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So here's how we go about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I draw this triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the angle here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the adjacent, opposite, hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the first thing is how can I make the cosecant appear here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What dimensions should I give to the sides in order for the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>, sorry, in order for <EXPRESSION> to be the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>-- that means the cosecant of <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is the arccosecant, so <EXPRESSION> is the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what'll I take the sides to be, to get the cosecant?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The cosecant is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is the opposite over the hypotenuse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get hypotenuse over opposite.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's supposed to be what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I could make the opposite anything I want, but the simplest thing is to make it <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then what does that mean about the rest of the sides?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hypotenuse had better be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I've recovered this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So here's a triangle that exhibits the correct angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This remaining side is going to be useful to us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've got a triangle of the correct angle <EXPRESSION>, and now I want to compute the tangent of that angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's opposite divided by adjacent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very flexible tool that'll be useful to you in many different times.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Whenever you have to undo a trig substitution, this is likely to be useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that was a good game.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No winners in this game.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're all winners.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No losers, we're all winners.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let me make this table of the different trig substitutions, and how they can be useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Summary of trig substitutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So over here, we have, if you see, so if your integrand contains, make a substitution to get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if your integrand contains, I'll write these things out as square roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If it contains the <EXPRESSION>, this is what we talked about on Thursday.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I was trying to find the area of that piece of a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There, I suggested that we should make the substitution <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Either one works just as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's no way to prefer one over the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when you make the substitution, <EQUATION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this expression becomes = this expression under that substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then you've gotten rid of the square root, and you've got a trigonometric integral that you have to try to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you made the substitution <EXPRESSION>, you'd get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you can go ahead as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just saw another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Namely, if you have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's like the example we had up here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> in this example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What did we do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We tried the substitution <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the reason is that I can plug into the trig identity up here in the upper left.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "And replace <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's one more thing in this table.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sort of, the only remaining sum or difference of terms like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's what happens if you have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there, I think we can make a substitution a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because, after all, <EXPRESSION>-- so <EXPRESSION> - <EXPRESSION>-- Sorry.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see what happens when I make that substitution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Under this substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "And you find <EXPRESSION>, coming out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that's what you get, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "After I take the square root, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So these are the three basic trig substitution forms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Where trig substitutions are useful to get rid of expressions like this, and replace them by trigonometric expressions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you use this trick, you do the integral if you can and then you use this trick to get rid of the <EXPRESSION> at the end.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "So now, the last thing I want to talk about today is called completing the square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that comes in because unfortunately, not every square root of a quadratic has such a simple form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will often encounter things that are not just the square root of something simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like one of these forms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like there might be a middle term in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't actually have time to show you an example of how this comes out in a sort of practical example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it does happen quite frequently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I want to show you how to deal with things like the following example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's try to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So there's a square root of some square, some quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's very much like this business.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it isn't of any of these forms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so what I want to do is show you how to rewrite it in one of those forms using substitution, again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All this is about substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the game is to rewrite quadratic as something like <EXPRESSION> plus something or other.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "Plus some other constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "So write it, try to write it, in the form of a square plus or minus another constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "And then we'll go on from there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you square this form out, then the middle term is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that, since I have a middle term here, I pretty much know what a has to be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The only choice in order to get something like <EXPRESSION> out of this, is to take a to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Because then, this is what you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This isn't quite right yet, but let's compute what I have here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, so far so good, plus <EXPRESSION>, and I don't have a plus <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "So I have to fix that by subtracting <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what I mean.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've completed the square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The word for this process of eliminating the middle term by using the square of an expression like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's called completing the square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can use that process to compute this integral.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I can rewrite this integral, rewrite this denominator like this.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "And then I'm going to try to use one of these forms over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in order to get a single variable there, instead of something complicated like <EXPRESSION>, I'm inclined to come up with another variable name and write it =, write <EXPRESSION> as that other variable name.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 163, "end_offset": 168}]}
{"text": "So here's another little direct substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Figure out what du is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's pretty easy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then rewrite the integral in those terms.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then in the denominator I have, well, I have the square root of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh yeah, so I think as part of this I'll write out what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "The point is, it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the data box containing the substitution data.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so now I can put that in.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "I have <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In terms of <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, now I'm in a happier position because I can look for <EXPRESSION> for something like that in my table here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it actually sits down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So except for the use of the letter <EXPRESSION> here instead of <EXPRESSION> over there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "That tells me what I want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to handle this, what I should use is a trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the trig substitution that's suggested is, according to the bottom line with <EQUATION>, so <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The suggestion is, I should take <EXPRESSION>-- But I'd better not use the letter x any more.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I don't have a letter <EXPRESSION>, I have the letter <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should take <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "And then some letter I haven't used before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is available.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a look-up table process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see the <EXPRESSION>, I see that that's of this form.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm instructed to make this substitution.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "And that's what I just did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see how it works out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is, here's the payoff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm supposed to be able to rewrite that in terms of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "According to this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right, yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: But I squared it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now I'll square root it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "And I'll get a <EXPRESSION> and this tangent will go away.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "So there's my data box for this substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's go on to another board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So where I'm at is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I have all the data I need here to rewrite that in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the denominator is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ha.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so some very nice simplification happens here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the <EXPRESSION> cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm left with trying to work with the integral, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And luckily enough at the very beginning of the hour, I worked out how to compute the integral of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "And we're done with the calculus part.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's no more integral there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I still am not quite done with the problem, because again I have these two substitutions to try to undo.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 107}]}
{"text": "So let's undo them one by one.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have this trig substitution here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I could use my triangle trick, if I need to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe I don't need to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, do I know what the <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Do I know what the <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I lucked out, in this case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I don't have to go through and use that triangle trick.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've undone this trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not quite done yet because my answer is involved with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I wanted originally was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this direct substitution that I started with is really easy to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can just put <EXPRESSION> every time I see a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus the square root.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's going to happen when I put <EXPRESSION> in place for <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You know what you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get exactly what we started with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I put <EXPRESSION> in place of the <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've gotten back to a function purely in terms of <EXPRESSION> OK, that's a good place to quit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have a great little one-day break.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess this class doesn't meet on Monday anyway.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Bye.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you remember last time, we looked at parametric equations -- -- as a way of describing the motion of a point that moves in the plane or in space as a function of time of your favorite parameter that will tell you how far the motion has progressed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I think we did it in detail the example of the cycloid, which is the curve traced by a point on a wheel that's rolling on a flat surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have this example where we have this wheel that's rolling on the x-axis, and we have this point on the wheel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, as it moves around, it traces a trajectory that moves more or less like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I'm trying a new color.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is this visible from the back?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, no more blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so remember, in general, we are trying to find the position, so, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, maybe <EXPRESSION> if we are in space -- -- of a moving point along a trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, one way to think about this is in terms of the position vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, position vector is just the vector whose components are coordinates of a point, OK, so if you prefer, that's the same thing as a vector from the origin to the moving point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe our point is here, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this vector here -- This vector here is vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's also the position vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, just to give you, again, that example -- -- if I take the cycloid for a wheel of radius <EXPRESSION>, and let's say that we are going at unit speed so that the angle that we used as a parameter of time is the same thing as time when the position vector, in this case, we found to be, just to make sure that they have it right, .", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's a formula that you should have in your notes from last time, except we had <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION> because we were using the angle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now I'm saying, we are moving at unit speed, so time and angle are the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, what's interesting about this is we can analyze the motion in more detail.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, now that we know the position of the point as a function of time, we can try to study how it varies in particular things like the speed and acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's start with speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in fact we can do better than speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's not start with speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, speed is a number.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells you how fast you are going along your trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, if you're driving in a car, then it tells you how fast you are going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, unless you have one of these fancy cars with a GPS, it doesn't tell you which direction you're going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's useful information, too, if you're trying to figure out what your trajectory is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, there's two aspects to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is how fast you are going, and the other is in what direction you're going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means actually we should use a vector maybe to think about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, that's called the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the way we can get it, so, it's called usually <EXPRESSION>, so, <EXPRESSION> here stands for velocity more than for vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you just get it by taking the derivative of a position vector with respect to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, it's our first time writing this kind of thing with a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the basic rule is you can take the derivative of a vector quantity just by taking the derivatives of each component.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's just <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and if you have <EXPRESSION> component, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me -- OK, so -- OK, so let's see what it is for the cycloid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, an example of a cycloid, well, so what do we get when we take the derivatives of this formula there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Very good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's at least one thing you should remember from single variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Hopefully you remember even more than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells us at any time how fast we are going, and in what direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, observe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember last time at the end of class we were trying to figure out what exactly happens near the bottom point, when we have this motion that seems to stop and go backwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we answered that one way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's try to understand it in terms of velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if I plug <EQUATION> in here?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "Then, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The velocity is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at the time, at that particular time, our point is actually not moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, it's been moving just before, and it starts moving just afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just the instant, at that particular instant, the speed is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's especially maybe a counterintuitive thing, but something is moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And at that time, it's actually stopped.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, let's see, so that's the vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's useful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if you want just the usual speed as a number, then, what will you do?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you will just take exactly the magnitude of this vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, speed, which is the scalar quantity is going to be just the magnitude of the vector, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, in this case, while it would be <EXPRESSION>, and if you expand that, you will get, let me take a bit more space, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It seems to simplify a little bit because we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's going to be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at this point, if I was going to ask you, when is the speed the smallest or the largest?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could answer based on that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, at <EQUATION>, well, that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The point is not moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At <EQUATION>, that ends up being <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's when you're truly at the top of the arch, and that's when the point is moving the fastest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, they are spending twice as fast as the wheel because the wheel is moving to the right at unit speed, and the wheel is also rotating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's moving to the right and unit speed relative to the center so that the two effects add up, and give you a speed of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anyway, that's a formula we can get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now, what about acceleration?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here I should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration, the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you might think acceleration is just the directive of speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If my car goes <EXPRESSION> miles an hour on the highway and it's going a constant speed, it's not accelerating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's say that I'm taking a really tight turn.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, I'm going to feel something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is some force being exerted.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the definition will take effect.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, even if the speed is constant, that means, even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same, the velocity vector can still rotate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant to physics when you find <EQUATION>; that's the (a) that you have in mind here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in general, that's not quite the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we take the example of the cycloid, well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the acceleration vector is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, my point is not moving at that particular time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's accelerating up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that actually as it comes down, first it's slowing down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, this is completely false.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, they are really not the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you can get there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it will not be a very nice expression.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's more relevant might be this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is actually the speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one, I don't know what it means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's continue our exploration.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In general, maybe you would say you start at time, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's a convention.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, you get to choose how you count it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in this case, if you are moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- So if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is, you have this nice-looking curve; how long is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "And, to say the truth, I don't really know how to integrate that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "However, we'll see one later using a cool trick, and multi-variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for now, we'll just leave the formula like that, and we don't know how long it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, that's the best I can offer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the usual notation is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It has a hat because it's a unit vector, and <EXPRESSION> because it's tangent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, how do we get this unit vector?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe I should have pointed out before that if you're moving along some trajectory, say you're going in that direction, then when you're at this point, the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells you the direction of motion in particular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is rescale it, so, at its length becomes one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> divided by a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see what we can say.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can say that <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, so, that's the velocity vector, that's the same thing as if I use the chain rule <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 117}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 132}]}
{"text": "OK, so, let's think about this things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this guy here we've just seen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same as the speed, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this one here should be <EXPRESSION> divided by its length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means this actually should be the unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let me rewrite that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe if I actually stated directly that way, see, I'm just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The length is the speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The direction is tangent to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the speed is <EXPRESSION>, and the vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's how we get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's try just to see why <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's think of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> means position vector <EXPRESSION> means you have the origin, which is somewhere out there, and the vector <EXPRESSION> is here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> means we move by a small amount, <EXPRESSION> along the trajectory a certain distance <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we look at how the position vector changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we'll have a small change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me call that vector <EXPRESSION> corresponding to the size, corresponding to the length <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, <EXPRESSION> should be essentially roughly =, well, its direction will be tangent to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take a small enough interval, then the direction will be almost tensioned to the trajectory times the length of it will be <EXPRESSION>, the distance that I have traveled.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "OK, sorry, maybe I should explain that on a separate board.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let's say that we have that amount of time, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's zoom into that curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This vector here I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "The length of this vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the direction is essentially that of a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION>, that's the distance traveled divided by the time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be close to the speed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now if I divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, I get this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if I take the limit as <EXPRESSION> turns to <EXPRESSION>, then I get the same formula with the derivatives and with an equality.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "It's an approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The approximation becomes better and better if I go to smaller intervals.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, are there any questions about this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, that's correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's be more careful, actually.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you're asking about whether the <EXPRESSION> is actually strictly tangent to the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that -- That's correct.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, <EXPRESSION> is not strictly tangent to anything.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe I should draw another picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I'm going from here to here, then <EXPRESSION> is going to be this arc inside the curve while the vector will be going in this direction, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, they are not strictly parallel to each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's why it's only approximately =.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Similarly, this distance, the length of <EXPRESSION> is not exactly the length along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually a bit shorter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if we imagine a smaller and smaller portion of the curve, then this effect of the curve being a curve and not a straight line becomes more and more negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you zoom into the curve sufficiently, then it looks more and more like a straight line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what I said becomes true in the limit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what happens next?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because, after all, a lot of what's here you can just do in coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we don't really need vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, still I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe it's more complicated than that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They have more and more complicated theories.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, is swept at constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let me explain again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is supposed to be light blue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Can you see that it's different from white?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, me neither.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, it doesn't really matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the planet moves on its orbit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's try to see, what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's start with the first step.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the most complicated thing in here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's this area swept out by the line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we express that area in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take a sufficiently small amount of time, this shaded part looks like a triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have to find the area of the triangle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know how to do that now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, I should say, this is the area swept in time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's use that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can take out the <EXPRESSION>, which is scalar.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> has constant length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, let me try to explain that again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross products <EXPRESSION> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I should say, with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How do we see that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's take a small time interval, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In time, <EXPRESSION>, our planet moves by <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if it moves by <EXPRESSION>, it means that this triangle up there has two sides.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is the position vector, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other one is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula we've seen for the area of a triangle in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the area is one half of the cross product, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, magnitude of the cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Area divided by <EXPRESSION> is constant at our time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, this is constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now, what about the other half of the law?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it says that the motion is in a plane, and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it contains, also, the sun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it contains the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's think about that plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's what we are saying.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, there is another vector that I know it is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You could say the position vector at another time, or at any time, but in fact, what's also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, if I'm moving in the plane, then position and velocity are in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the plane of motion contains <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what's the direction of the cross product <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's normal to the plane of motion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that means, now, that actually we've put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <EXPRESSION> has constant length and constant direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you want, it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's, however, instant, if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so -- [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] OK, so, Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that <EQUATION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the law says.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in terms of derivatives, it means <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now, so there's an interesting thing to note, which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions, with dot products or cross products.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's only one catch, which is that when we differentiate a cross product, we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The guy on the right stays on the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, if you know that <EXPRESSION>, then you are safe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you know it as <EXPRESSION>, then you are not safe.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's the only thing to watch for.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, product rule is OK for taking the derivative of a dot product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There, you don't actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There you just need to be a little bit more careful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, now that we know that, we can write this as <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's reformulate things slightly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> already has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's what we call the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the acceleration, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now what's the next step?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know what <EXPRESSION> is because, remember, a vector cross itself is always <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "So, this is the same <EQUATION>, and that's the same as saying that the cross product of two vectors is <EXPRESSION> exactly when the parallelogram of the form has no area.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means the acceleration is parallel to the position.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, in fact, what Kepler's second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, since we know that acceleration is caused by a force that's equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force -- -- is parallel to the position vector, that means, well, if you have the sun here at the origin, and if you have your planets, well, the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, the law doesn't even say whether it's going towards the sun or away from the sun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what we know now is that, of course, the attraction is towards the sun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were going away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, actually, if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field caused by a point charged particle, it also satisfies Kepler's law, satisfies the same law.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's the end for today, thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "so -- OK, so remember last time, on Tuesday we learned about the chain rule, and so for example we saw that if we have a function that depends, sorry, on three variables, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> themselves depend on some variable, <EXPRESSION>, then you can find a formula for <EXPRESSION> by writing down <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the meaning of that formula is that while the change in <EXPRESSION> is caused by changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> change at rates <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, this causes a function to change accordingly using, well, the partial derivatives tell you how sensitive <EXPRESSION> is to changes in each variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, we are going to just rewrite this in a new notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to rewrite this in a more concise form as gradient of <EXPRESSION> dot product with velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "So, the gradient of <EXPRESSION> is a vector formed by putting together all of the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's the vector whose components are the partials.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, it's a vector that depends on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "These guys depend on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's actually one vector for each point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can talk about the gradient of <EXPRESSION> at some point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at each point, it gives you a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That actually is what we will call later a vector field.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll get back to that later.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is just the velocity vector <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the new definition for today is the definition of the gradient vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, our goal will be to understand a bit better, what does this vector mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does it measure?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what can we do with it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you see that in terms of information content, it's really the same information that's already in the partial derivatives, or in the differential.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, yes, and I should say, of course you can also use the gradient and other things like approximation formulas and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so far, it's just notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a way to rewrite things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, so here's the first cool property of the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I claim that the gradient vector is perpendicular to the level surface corresponding to setting the function, <EXPRESSION>, = a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so if I draw a contour plot of my function, so, actually forget about <EXPRESSION> because I want to draw a two variable contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, say I have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then maybe it has some contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I'm saying if I take the gradient of a function at this point, (x, y).", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I will have a vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I draw that vector on top of a contour plot, it's going to end up being perpendicular to the level curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Same thing if I have a function of three variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, I can try to draw its contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Of course, I can't really do it because the contour plot would be living in space with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it would be a bunch of level faces, and the gradient vector would be a vector in space.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That vector is perpendicular to the level faces.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's try to see that on a couple of examples.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do a first example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the easiest case?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's take a linear function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I will take <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so, what's the gradient of this function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the first component will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, <EXPRESSION>, that's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what is the levels of this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if I set <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>, that means I look at the points where <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "What kind of service is that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we know how to find a normal vector to this plane just by looking at the coefficients.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a plane with a normal vector exactly this gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, in a way, this is the only case you need to check because of linear approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you replace a function by its linear approximation, that means you will replace the level surfaces by their tension planes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, you'll actually end up in this situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But maybe that's not very convincing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do another example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do a second example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say we look at the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now it's a function of just two variables because that way we'll be able to actually draw a picture for you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what are the level sets of this function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, they're going to be circles, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION> is a circle, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I should say, maybe, sorry, the level curve is a circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the contour plot looks something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what's the gradient vector?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the gradient of this function, so, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say I take a point, <EXPRESSION>, and I try to draw my gradient vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here at <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so, I have to draw the vector, &<EXPRESSION>;<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>&<EXPRESSION>;.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What does it look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's going in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's parallel to the position vector for this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's actually twice the position vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I guess it goes more or less like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's interesting, too, is it is perpendicular to this circle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's a general feature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, let me show you more examples, oops, not the one I want.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I don't know if you can see it so well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, hopefully you can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here I have a contour plot of a function, and I have a blue vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the gradient vector at the pink point on the plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can see, I can move the pink point, and the gradient vector, of course, changes because the gradient depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what doesn't change is that it's always perpendicular to the level curves.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anywhere I am, my gradient stays perpendicular to the level curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is that visible for people who can't see blue?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, OK, so we have a lot of evidence, but let's try to prove the theorem because it will be interesting.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first of all, sorry, any questions about the statement, the example, anything, yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ah, very good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does the gradient vector, why is the gradient vector perpendicular in one direction rather than the other?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll see the answer to that in a few minutes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let me just tell you immediately, to the side, which side it's pointing to, it's always pointing towards higher values of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and we'll see in that maybe about half an hour.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, well, let me say actually points towards higher values of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't see any questions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's try to prove this theorem, at least this part of the theorem.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're not going to prove that just yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will come in a while.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, well, maybe we want to understand first what happens if we move inside the level curve, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's imagine that we are taking a moving point that stays on the level curve or on the level surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we know, well, what happens is that the function stays constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, we can also know how quickly the function changes using the chain rule up there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe the chain rule will actually be the key to understanding how the gradient vector and the motion on the level service relate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's take a curve, <EQUATION>, that stays inside, well, maybe I should say on the level surface, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's think about what that means.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, just to get you used to this idea, I'm going to draw a level surface of a function of three variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's a surface given by the equation <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so now I'm going to have a point on that, and it's going to move on that surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I will have some parametric curve that lives on this surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the question is, what's going to happen at any given time?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the first observation is that the velocity vector, what can I say about the velocity vector of this motion?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going to be tangent to the level surface, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I move on a surface, then at any point, my velocity is tangent to the curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, if it's tangent to the curve, then it's also tangent to the surface because the curve is inside the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, OK, it's getting a bit cluttered.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Maybe I should draw a bigger picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me do that right away here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I have my level surface, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I have a curve on that, and at some point, I'm going to have a certain velocity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the claim is that the velocity, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> is tangent -- -- to the level, <EQUATION> because it's tangent to the curve, and the curve is inside the level, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what else can we say?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we have, the chain rule will tell us how the value of <EXPRESSION> changes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, by the chain rule, we have <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the rate of change of the value of <EXPRESSION> as I move along this curve is given by the dot product between the gradient and the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so, well, maybe I can rewrite it as <EXPRESSION>, and that should be, well, what should it be?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "What happens to the value of <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> changes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it stays constant because we are moving on a curve.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That curve might be complicated, but it stays always on the level, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> because <EQUATION>, which is a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now if we have a dot product that's <EXPRESSION>, that tells us that these two guys are perpendicular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- So if the gradient vector is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>, OK, that's a good start.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent that's tangent to the level surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about other vectors tangent to the level surface?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in fact, I could use any curve drawn on the level of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I could move, really, any way I wanted on that surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In particular, I claim that I could have chosen my velocity vector to be any vector tangent to the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's write this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is true for any curve, or, I'll say for any motion on the level surface, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means <EXPRESSION> can be any vector tangent to the surface tangent to the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, for example, OK, let me draw one more picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I have my level surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm drawing more and more levels, and they never quite look the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I have a point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, at this point, I have the tangent plane to the level surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this is tangent plane to the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, if I choose any vector in that tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's say I choose the one that goes in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, I can actually find a curve that goes in that direction, and stays on the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here, that would be a curve that somehow goes from the right to the left, and of course it has to end up going up or something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so given any vector tangent -- -- let's call that vector <EXPRESSION> tangent to the level, we get that the gradient is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "So, if the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent to this curve, but also to any vector, I can draw that tangent to my surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what does that mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that means the gradient is actually perpendicular to the tangent plane or to the surface at this point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the gradient is perpendicular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, well, here, I've illustrated things with a three-dimensional example, but really it works the same if you have only two variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then you have a level curve that has a tangent line, and the gradient is perpendicular to that line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's actually pretty neat because there is a nice application of this, which is to try to figure out, now we know, actually, how to find the tangent plane to anything, pretty much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say that, for example, I want to find -- -- the tangent plane -- -- to the surface with equation, let's say, <EQUATION> at the point (2, 1, 1).", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we do that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, one way that we already know, if we solve this for <EXPRESSION>, so we can write <EQUATION>, then we know tangent plane approximation for the graph of a function, <EXPRESSION> = some function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, that doesn't look like it's the best way to do it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the best way to it, now that we have the gradient vector, is actually to directly say, oh, we know the normal vector to this plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The normal vector will just be the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Oh, I think I have a cool picture to show.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's what it looks like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so here you have the surface <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's called a hyperboloid because it looks like when you get when you spin a hyperbola around an axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, here's a tangent plane at the given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it doesn't look very tangent because it crosses the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it's really, if you think about it, you will see it's really the plane that's approximating the surface in the best way that you can at this given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is really the tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we find this plane?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you can plot it on a computer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's not exactly how you would look for it in the first place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the way to do it is that we compute the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, a gradient of what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, a gradient of this function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I should say, this is the level set, <EQUATION>, where <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we know that the gradient of this, well, what is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at this given point, I guess we are at <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, and that's going to be the normal vector to the surface or to the tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one way to define the tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, it has the same normal vector as the surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one way to define the normal vector to the surface, if you prefer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Being perpendicular to the surface means that you are perpendicular to its tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the equation is, well, <EXPRESSION> = something, where something is, well, we should just plug in that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll get <EXPRESSION> looks like we'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, we could simplify dividing everything by two, but it's not very important here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now if you have a surface given by an evil equation, and a point on the surface, well, you know how to find the tangent plane to the surface at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, let me give just another reason why, another way that we could have seen this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I claim, in fact, we could have done this without the gradient, or using the gradient in a somehow disguised way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here's another way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the other way to do it would be to start with a differential, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, while it's pretty much the same content, but let me write it as a differential, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "So, at a given point, at (2, 1, 1), this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if we want to change this into an approximation formula, we can.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know that the change in <EXPRESSION> is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so when do we stay on the level surface?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we stay on the level surface when <EXPRESSION> doesn't change, so, when this becomes <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, what does this approximation sign mean?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it means for small changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, this guy will be close to that guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It also means something else.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Remember, these approximation formulas, they are linear approximations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They mean that we replace the function, actually, by some closest linear formula that will be nearby.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, in particular, if we set this = <EXPRESSION> instead of approximately <EXPRESSION>, it means we'll actually be moving on the tangent plane to the level set.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "If you want strict equalities in approximations means that we replace the function by its tangent approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- [APPLAUSE] OK, so the level corresponds to <EQUATION> and its tangent plane corresponds to <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what I'm trying to say, basically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that means it's the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what's the change in <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means, well, we started with <EQUATION>, and we moved to some other value, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's actually <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's how much <EXPRESSION> has changed compared to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the equation of a tangent plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the same equation as the one over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are just two different methods to get it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this one explains to you what's going on in terms of approximation formulas.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This one goes right away, by using the gradient factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in a way, with this one, you don't have to think nearly as much.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, you can use either one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's move on to new topic, which is another application of a gradient vector, and that is directional derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's say that we have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we know how to compute partial <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, which measure how <EXPRESSION> changes if I move in the direction of the x axis or in the direction of the y axis.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So, what about moving in other directions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, of course, we've seen other approximation formulas and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, we can still ask, is there a derivative in every direction?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's basically, yes, that's the directional derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so these are derivatives in the direction of I hat or j hat, the vectors that go along the x or the y axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what if we move in another direction, let's say, the direction of some unit vector, let's call it u.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"text": "OK, so if I give you a unit vector, you can ask yourself, if I move in the direction, how quickly will my function change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- So, let's look at the straight trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What this should mean is I start at some value, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and there I have my vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "And, I'm going to move in a straight line in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I have the graph of my function -- -- and I'm asking myself how quickly does the value change when I move on the graph in that direction?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's look at a straight line trajectory So, we have a position vector, <EXPRESSION>, that will depend on some parameter which I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 145}]}
{"text": "You'll see why very soon, in such a way that the derivative is this given unit vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, why do I use s for my parameter rather than <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's a convention.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm moving at unit speed along this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that means that actually, I'm parameterizing things by the distance that I've traveled along a curve, sorry, along this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here it's called s in the sense of arc length.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Actually, it's not really an arc because it's a straight line, so it's the distance along the line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so because we are parameterizing by distance, we are just using s as a convention just to distinguish it from other situations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so, now, the question will be, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the rate of change of w when I move like that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, of course we know the answer because that's a special case of the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "So, that's how we will actually compute it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "But, in terms of what it means, it really means we are asking ourselves, we start at a point and we change the variables in a certain direction, which is not necessarily the x or the y direction, but really any direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, what's the derivative in that direction?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, does that make sense as a concept?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Kind of?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see some faces that are not completely convinced.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe you should show more pictures.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me first write down a bit more and show you something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I just want to give you the actual definition.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, first of all in case you wonder what this is all about, so let's say the components of our unit vector are two numbers, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, it means we'll move along the line <EXPRESSION> = some initial value, the point where we are actually at the directional derivative <EXPRESSION>, or I meant to say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we plug that into <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we take the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have a notation for that which is going to be <EXPRESSION> with a subscript in the direction of u to indicate in which direction we are actually going to move.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's called the directional derivative -- -- in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let's see what it means geometrically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, remember, we've seen things about partial derivatives, and we see that the partial derivatives are the slopes of slices of the graph by vertical planes that are parallel to the x or the y directions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, if I have a point, at any point, I can slice the graph of my function by two planes, one that's going along the x, one along the y direction.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "And then, I can look at the slices of the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me see if I can use that thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we can look at the slices of the graph that are drawn here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, we look at the tangent lines to the slices, and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, similarly, the directional derivative means, actually, we'll be slicing our graph by the vertical plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's not really colorful, something more colorful.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll be slicing things by a plane that is now in the direction of this vector, <EXPRESSION>, and we'll be looking at the slope of the slice of the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what that looks like here, so that's the same applet the way that you've used on your problem set in case you are wondering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, now, I'm picking a point on the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, at that point, I slice the graph.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here I'm starting by slicing in the direction of the x axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, what I'm measuring here by the slope of the slice is the partial in the x direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's really <EXPRESSION>, which is also the directional derivative in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have all of these planes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you see at the bottom left, I have the direction in which I'm going.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's this, like, rotating line that tells you in which direction I'm going to be moving.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And for each direction, I have a plane.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, when I slice by that plane, I will get, so I have this direction here going maybe to the southwest.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane, and the slice has a certain slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I think that's as graphic as I can get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's see how we compute that guy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me just write again just in case you want to, in case you didn't hear me it's the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane -- -- that contains the given direction, that's parallel to the direction, u.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how do we compute it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can use the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "The chain rule implies that <EXPRESSION> is actually the gradient of w dot product with the velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "But, remember we say that we are going to be moving at unit speed in the direction of u.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, that's just gradient <EXPRESSION> dot product with the unit vector <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so the formula that we remember is really <EXPRESSION> in the direction of u is gradient <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, maybe I should also say in words, this is the component of the gradient in the direction of u.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, maybe that makes more sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, the directional derivative in the direction of I hat is the component along the x axes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same as, indeed, the partial derivatives in the x direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Things make sense.", "entities": []}
{"text": "dw/ds in the direction of I hat is, sorry, gradient <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, maybe I should write, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, now, so that's basically what we need to know to compute these guys.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, let's go back to the gradient and see what this tells us about the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[APPLAUSE] I see you guys are having fun.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, OK, let's do a little bit of geometry here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That should calm you down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we said <EXPRESSION> in the direction of <EXPRESSION> is gradient <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the same as the length of gradient <EXPRESSION> times the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that happens to be one because we are taking the unit vector times the cosine of the angle between the gradient and the given unit vector, <EXPRESSION>, so, have this angle, theta.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's another way of saying we are taking the component of a gradient in the direction of u.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now, what does that tell us?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's try to figure out in which directions w changes the fastest, in which direction it increases the most or decreases the most, or doesn't actually change.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, when is this going to be the largest?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I fix a point, if I set a point, then the gradient vector at that point is given to me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, the question is, in which direction does it change the most quickly?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what I can change is the direction, and this will be the largest when the cosine is one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this is largest when the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means the angle is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means u is actually in the direction of the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's a new way to think about the direction of a gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the direction of gradient <EXPRESSION> is the direction of fastest increase of <EXPRESSION> at the given point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what is the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it's actually the directional derivative in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so if I go in that direction, which gives me the fastest increase, then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, with the direction of the fastest decrease?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's going in the opposite direction, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, if you are on a mountain, and you know that you are facing the mountain, that's the direction of fastest increase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, the minimal value of <EXPRESSION> is achieved when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EXPRESSION> is in the direction of minus the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It points opposite to the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, finally, when do we have <EQUATION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in which direction does the function not change?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we have two answers to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is to just use the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That means that <EXPRESSION> is perpendicular to the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other way to think about it, the direction in which the value doesn't change is a direction that's tangent to the level surface.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we are not changing a, it means we are moving along the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me just show that on the picture here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if actually show you the gradient, you can't really see it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I need to move it a bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that I have chosen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if I choose a slice that's perpendicular, and a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient, so that's actually tangent to the level curve, then you see that my slice is flat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't actually have any slop.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The directional derivative in a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient is basically <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, if I rotate, then the slope sort of increases, increases, increases, and it becomes the largest when I'm going in the direction of a gradient.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, if I keep rotating, then the slope will decrease again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then it becomes <EXPRESSION> when I perpendicular, and then it becomes negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the most negative when I pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <EXPRESSION> again when I'm back perpendicular.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it would be going towards higher values of a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't know if you can see the labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's it for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's the main topic for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, remember yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a point where the partial derivatives are both <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's local minima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, maybe I should show the function on this contour plot, there is local maxima, which are like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, there's saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It will have several critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, this example here, well, you see on the plot that there is two maxima.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It crosses itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Along the x direction, the values will increase.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, and, in fact, why do we care?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we have two obvious candidates.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have this local maximum and that local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, four wins.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, where's the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's another feature.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we have to try both.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, but so we'll get back to that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, it will again involve the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function that's actually just quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's say I have a function, <EXPRESSION> that's of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well, and if you plug <EQUATION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "You can also see, if you try to do a linear approximation of this, well, all these guys are much smaller than <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are small.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the linear approximation, the tangent plane to the graph is really just <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, how do we do it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, yesterday we actually did an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it, so remember, we were looking at something that started with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, there were other terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's forget them now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, this is a sum of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, the origin will be a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it turns out we can do something similar in general no matter what the values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll just try to first complete things to a square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in general, well, let me be slightly less general, and let me assume that a is not zero because otherwise I can't do what I'm going to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm going to write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I have my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now this looks like the beginning of the square of something, OK, just like what we did over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what is it the square of?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you'd start with <EXPRESSION> plus I claim if I put <EXPRESSION> and I square it, then see the cross term <EXPRESSION> will become <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "Of course, now I also get some y squares out of this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How many y squares do I get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, and I want, in fact, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the number of <EXPRESSION> that I should add is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "OK, let's see that again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I expand this thing, I will get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's going to be my <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I also get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that cancels out with this guy here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I will be left with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, do you see it kind of?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, if not, well, try expanding this square again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, maybe I'll do it just to convince you.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, so if I expand this, I will get A times, let me put that in a different color because you shouldn't write that down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just to convince you again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you don't see it yet, let's expend this thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the two A's cancel out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get <EXPRESSION> the square of that's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here, the a and the a simplifies, and now these two terms simplify and give me just <EXPRESSION> in the end.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "OK, and that's kind of unreadable after I've canceled everything, but if you follow it, you see that basically I've just rewritten my initial function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is that kind of OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, otherwise there's just no substitute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll have to do it yourself, I'm afraid.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, let me continue to play with this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm just going to put this in a slightly different form just to clear the denominators.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, I will instead write this as <EXPRESSION> times the big thing.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "So, I'm going to just put <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so far I have the same thing as here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just introduced the <EXPRESSION> that cancels out, plus for the other one, I'm just clearing the denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I end up with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's a lot of terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, what does it look like?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, it looks like, so we have some constant factors, and here we have a square, and here we have a square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, basically, we've written this as a sum of two squares, well, a sum or a difference of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you will have, the function will always take nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the origin will be a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if you have a difference of two squares that typically you'll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger, you will have a positive or a negative quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so I claim there's various cases to look at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in fact, I claim there will be three cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that's good news for us because after all, we want to distinguish between three possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's first do away with the most complicated one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What if <EXPRESSION> is negative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is, so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity, while the second one will be something negative times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it will be a negative quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so one term is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The other is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That tells us we actually have a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We have, in fact, written our function as a difference of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you want, what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates called <EQUATION>, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the difference of squares directly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's the first case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The second case is where <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, what happens if that's zero?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then it means that this term over there goes away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what we have is just one square.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In the other direction, it's going to actually be degenerate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for example, forget all the clutter in there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Say I give you just the function of two variables, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION> at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if I try to plot the graph, it will look like, well, <EXPRESSION> is here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "So, it will depend on <EXPRESSION> in that way, but it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION> at all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what the graph looks like is something like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, basically it's a valley whose bottom is completely flat.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means, actually, we have a degenerate critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called degenerate because there is a direction in which nothing happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, you have critical points everywhere along the y axis.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, whether the square that we have is <EXPRESSION> or something else, namely, <EXPRESSION>, it doesn't matter.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, it will still get this degenerate behavior.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But there's a direction in which nothing happens because we just have the square of one quantity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm sure that <EXPRESSION> students means <EXPRESSION> different ring tones, but I'm not eager to hear all of them, thanks.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, so, this is what's called a degenerate critical point, and [LAUGHTER].", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so basically we'll leave it here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We won't actually try to figure out further what happens, and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function, a general function, not just one that's quadratic like this, then there will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers, maybe <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or things like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, they will mess up what happens in this valley.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it's a situation where we won't be able, actually, to tell automatically just by looking at second derivatives what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, for example, in a function of one variable, if you have just a function of one variable, say, <EXPRESSION>, well, if you try to decide what type of point the origin is, you're going to take the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It will be <EXPRESSION>, and then you can conclude.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those things depend on higher order derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we just won't like that case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We just won't try to figure out what's going on here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, the last situation is if <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, then, that means that actually we've written things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that we've written <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> plus something squared plus something else squared, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, these guys have the same sign, and that means that this term here will always be greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that means that we should either have a maximum or minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How we find out which one it is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we look at the sign of a, exactly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there's two sub-cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is if a is positive, then, this quantity overall will always be nonnegative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that means we have a minimum, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if a is negative on the other hand, so that means that we multiply this positive quantity by a negative number, we get something that's always negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is actually the maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, is that clear for everyone?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, yeah, so I said in the example <EQUATION>, it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the more general situation is <EXPRESSION> = some constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I guess it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it does depend on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but it only depends on this combination.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular direction, in the direction where this remains constant, so maybe if I set <EQUATION>, then this remains zero all the time.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"text": "So, there's a degenerate direction in which I stay at the minimum or maximum, or whatever it is that I have.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's why it's called degenerate.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is a direction in which nothing happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, yeah, so that's a very good question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, there's going to be the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why do not have derivatives yet?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's because I've been looking at this special example where we have a function like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so I don't actually need to take derivatives yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, secretly, that's because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> will be the second derivatives of the function, actually, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, we are going to go to general function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there, instead of having these coefficients <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and  given to us, we'll have to compute them as second derivatives.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "OK, so here, I'm basically setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion we'll use using second derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, yeah, so what you have a degenerate critical point, it could be a degenerate minimum, or a degenerate maximum depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in general, once you start having functions, you don't really know what will happen anymore.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It could also be a degenerate saddle, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we won't really be able to tell.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It is possible to have a degenerate saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, if I gave you <EXPRESSION>, you can convince yourself that if you take <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to be negative, it will be negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, it's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that's a degenerate saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't see it here because that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You need to have higher-order terms to see it happen.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's continue.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Before we continue, but see, I wanted to point out one small thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, here, we have the magic quantity, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've probably seen that before in your life.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yet, it looks like the quadratic formula, except that one involves <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's really the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's see, where does the quadratic formula come in here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let me write things differently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we've manipulated things, and got into a conclusion.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let me just do a different manipulation, and write this now instead as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, see, that's the same thing that I had before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so now this quantity here is always nonnegative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about this one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, of course, this one depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It means it depends on which direction you're going to move away from the origin, which ratio between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you will consider.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, I claim there's two situations.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One is, so, let's try to reformulate things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if a discriminate here is positive, then it means that these have roots and these have solutions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This quantity takes positive and negative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One way to convince yourself is just to, you know, plot <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "You know that there's two roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it might look like this, or might look like that depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in either case, it will take values of both signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that means that your function will take values of both signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value takes both positive and negative values.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so that means we have a saddle point, while the other situation, when <EXPRESSION> is negative -- -- means that this equation is quadratic never takes the value, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's always positive or it's always negative, depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the other case is if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then the quadratic doesn't have a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it could look like this or like that depending on whether <EXPRESSION> is positive or <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in particular, that means that <EXPRESSION> is always positive or always negative depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, that tells us that our function, , will be always positive or always negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then we'll get a minimum or maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, we'll have a min or a max depending on which situation we are in.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's another way to derive the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, you see here why the discriminate plays a role.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign, or whether it can actually cross the value, <EXPRESSION>, when you have the root of a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations, at least.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, you are willing to believe, I hope, that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, now what do we do with the general function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so in general, we want to look at second derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so now we are getting to the real stuff.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, how many second derivatives do we have?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's maybe the first thing we should figure out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we can take the derivative first with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then again with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "OK, that gives us something we denote by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Then, there's another one which is ,<EXPRESSION> which means you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Another thing you can do, is do first derivative respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That would be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, good news.", "entities": []}
{"text": "These are actually always = to each other.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so it's the fact that we will admit, it's actually not very hard to check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So these are always the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't need to worry about which one we do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's one computation that we won't need to do.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We can save a bit of effort.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, we have the last one, namely, the second partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so we have three of them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what does the second derivative test say?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It says, say that you have a critical point (x0, y0) of a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION>, and then let's compute the partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's call capital A the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's call capital B the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EQUATION> at this point, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative, and then we plug in the values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 94}]}
{"text": "So, these will just be numbers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, what we do is we look at the quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I am not forgetting the four.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You will see why there isn't one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, then there's two sub-cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If A is positive, then it's local minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The second case, so, still, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's going to be a local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's a saddle point, and finally, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then we actually cannot compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We don't know whether it's going to be a minimum, a maximum, or a saddle.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We know it's degenerate in some way, but we don't know what type of point it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so that's actually what you need to remember.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you are formula oriented, that's all you need to remember about today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, let's try to understand why, how this comes out of what we had there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, I think maybe I actually want to keep, so maybe I want to keep this middle board because it actually has, you know, the recipe that we found before the quadratic function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with the new.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, you are easily amused.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so first, let's check that these two things say the same thing in the special case that we are looking at.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's verify in the special case where the function was <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- Well, what is the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "If I take the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so first I want to take maybe the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "But first, let's take the first partial, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That will be <EXPRESSION> by, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be, well, let's take a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Wxy, I take the partial respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "OK, now we need, also, the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In case you don't believe what I told you about the mixed partials, <EXPRESSION>, well, you can check.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's, again, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, they are, indeed, the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if we now look at these quantities, that tells us, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is what we used to call <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, ooh.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] So, now you can compare the cases.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They are not listed in the same order just to make it harder.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we said first, so the saddle case is when <EXPRESSION> in big letters is negative, that's the same as <EXPRESSION> in lower case is negative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The case where capital <EXPRESSION> is positive, local min and local max corresponds to this one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, the case where we can't conclude was what used to be the degenerate one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so at least we don't seem to have messed up when copying the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, why does that work more generally than that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the answer that is, again, Taylor approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Aww.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let me just do here quadratic approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, quadratic approximation tells me the following thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It tells me, if I have a function, <EXPRESSION>, and I want to understand the change in <EXPRESSION> when I change <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, there's the first-order terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There is the linear terms that by now you should know and be comfortable with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, there's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, that's the starting point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But now, of course, if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, sorry, if we are at the critical point, then that's going to be <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that term actually goes away, and that's also zero at the critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, that term also goes away.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so linear approximation is really no good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We need more terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what are the next terms?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the next terms are quadratic terms, and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor formula for a function of a single variable, there was the derivative times <EXPRESSION> of a second derivative times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And see, this side here is really Taylor approximation in one variable looking only at <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But of course, we also have terms involving <EXPRESSION>, and terms involving simultaneously <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, these terms are <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's no one half in the middle because, in fact, you would have two terms, one for <EXPRESSION>, one for <EXPRESSION>, but they are the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, if you want to continue, there is actually cubic terms involving the third derivatives, and so on, but we are not actually looking at them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, now, when we do this approximation, well, the type of critical point remains the same when we replace the function by this approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so, we can apply the argument that we used to deduce things in the quadratic case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, it still works in the general case using this approximation formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So -- The general case reduces to the quadratic case.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, you see actually why, well, here you see, again, how this coefficient which we used to call little a is also <EXPRESSION> of capital A.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And same here: this coefficient is what we call capital B or little b, and this coefficient here is what we called little c or <EXPRESSION> of capital C.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 123}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 143, "end_offset": 152}]}
{"text": "And then, when you replace these into the various cases that we had here, you end up with the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, what about the degenerate case?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a degenerate critical point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so in fact, secretly, there's more terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is only an approximation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There would be terms involving third derivatives, and maybe even beyond that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, so it is not to generate case, they don't actually matter because the shape of the function, the shape of the graph, is actually determined by the quadratic terms.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, in the degenerate case, see, if I start with this and I add something even very, very small along the y axis, then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down, and turn my degenerate point in to either a minimum or a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, I won't be able to tell until I go further in the list of derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, in the degenerate case, what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we will need to analyze things more carefully.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, we're not going to bother with that in this class.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, we'll just say, well, we cannot compute, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I mean, you have to realize that in real life, you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] Well, if that happens, then what you should do is maybe try by inspection.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See if there's a good reason why the function should always be positive or always be negative, or something.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or, you know, plot it on a computer and see what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, otherwise we can't compute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's do an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, probably I should leave this on so that we still have the test with us.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, instead, OK, so I'll do my example here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so just an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's look at <EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm looking only at the first quadrant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I mean, I'm doing this because I don't want the denominator to become <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I'm just looking at the situation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's look first for, so, the question will be, what are the minimum and maximum of this function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the first thing we should do to answer this question is look for critical points, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, for that, we have to compute the first derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "And, we'll want to set that = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, we want to set that = to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So, what are the equations we have to solve?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I guess <EQUATION>, I mean, if I move this guy over here I get <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do you get by comparing these two?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> should both be, OK, so yeah, I agree with you that one and one is a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Why is it the only one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, first, if I divide this one by that one, I get <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "So, it tells me <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, if <EQUATION>, then if I put that into here, it will give me <EQUATION>, which tells me <EQUATION>, and therefore, <EQUATION> as well.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "OK, so, there's only one solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's only one critical point, which is going to be (1, 1).", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, now here's where you do a bit of work.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do you think of that critical point?", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, I see some valid votes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see some, OK, I see a lot of people answering four.", "entities": []}
{"text": "[LAUGHTER] that seems to suggest that maybe you haven't completed the second derivative yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yes, I see someone giving the correct answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see some people not giving quite the correct answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see more and more correct answers.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "To figure out what type of point is, we should compute the second partial derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is, what do we get what we take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, at our point, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so that tells us, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry, I should probably use a different blackboard for that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That tells us we are either a local minimum or local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's a local minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, you can check it's the global minimum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What about the maximum?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if a maximum is not actually at a critical point, it's on the boundary, or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See, so we have actually to check what happens when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> go to <EXPRESSION> or to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, if that happens, if <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, then the function goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Also, if <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, the maximum, well, the function goes to infinity when <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity or <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, or <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> go to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, it's not at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, so, in general, we have to check both the critical points and the boundaries to decide what happens.", "entities": []}
{"text": "OK, the end.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have a nice weekend.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's solve another 2nd order linear homogeneous differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this one-- well, I won't give you the details before I actually write it down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have our initial conditions <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we have <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I could go into the whole thing <EQUATION> is a solution, substitute it in, then factor out <EXPRESSION>, and have the characteristic equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "And if you want to see all of that over again, you might want to watch the previous video, just to see where that characteristic equation comes from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But in this video, I'm just going to show you, literally, how quickly you can do these type of problems mechanically.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So if this is our original differential equation, the characteristic equation is going to be-- and I'll do this in a different color-- <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And watch the previous video if you don't know where this characteristic equation comes from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But if you want to do these problems really quick, you just substitute the 2nd derivatives with an <EXPRESSION>, the first derivatives with an <EXPRESSION>, and then the function with-- oh sorry, no.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is supposed to be a constant-- And then the coefficient on the original function is just a constant, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you see what I did.", "entities": []}
{"text": "2nd derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "1st derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No derivative-- you could say that's <EXPRESSION>, or just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But this is our characteristic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can just figure out its roots.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is not a trivial one for me to factor so, if it's not trivial, you can just use the quadratic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we could say the solution of this is <EQUATION>-- <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION> plus or minus <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION> minus-- what's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All of that over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see, it's <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then another-- so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have <EQUATION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the two solutions of this characteristic equation-- ignore that, let me scratch that out in black so you know that's not like a <EXPRESSION> or something-- the two solutions of this characteristic equation are <EXPRESSION> =-- well <EQUATION>-- and <EQUATION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know our two r's, and we know that, from previous experience in the last video, that <EQUATION> is a solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the general solution of this differential equation is <EQUATION>-- let's use our first <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This differential equations problem was literally just a problem in using the quadratic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And once you figure out the r's you have your general solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we just have to use our initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to know the initial conditions, we need to know <EXPRESSION>, and we need to know <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just do that right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> of our general solution = <EXPRESSION>, plus-- derivative of the inside-- <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now let's use our actual initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't want to lose them-- let me rewrite them down here so I can scroll down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION> is = to <EXPRESSION>, and <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Those are our initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's use that information.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION>-- what happens when you substitute <EQUATION> here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "?", "entities": []}
{"text": "You get <EXPRESSION>, essentially, so that's just <EXPRESSION>-- well that's just <EXPRESSION> again, because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>-- =-- so this is, when <EQUATION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then let's use the second equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when we substitute <EXPRESSION> is = to <EXPRESSION> in the derivative-- so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> we get <EXPRESSION>-- this goes to <EXPRESSION> again-- plus <EXPRESSION>-- this is <EXPRESSION> again, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>-- is = to-- so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> for the derivative, <EQUATION>, or the derivative is <EXPRESSION> at that point, or the slope is <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "And now we have two equations and two unknowns, and we could solve it a ton of ways.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you know how to solve them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's multiply the top equation-- I don't know-- let's multiply it by <EXPRESSION>, and what do we get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "We get-- I'll do it in a different color-- we get <EXPRESSION> =-- what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now, let's subtract-- well, I don't want to confuse you, so let's just subtract the bottom from the top, so this cancels out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's just minus <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> =-- what's <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so we get <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we can substitute back in this top equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can just substitute <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> back into our general solution and we have found the particular solution of this differential equation, which is <EQUATION>-- <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, and we are done.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "And it might seem really fancy.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're solving a differential equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Our solution has <EXPRESSION> in it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We're taking derivatives and we're doing all sorts of things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But really the meat of this problem was solving a quadratic, which was our characteristic equation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And watch the previous video just to see why this characteristic equation works.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But it's very easy to come up with the characteristic equation, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you obviously see that <EXPRESSION> turns into <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> turns into <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> just turns into <EXPRESSION>, essentially.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you solve a quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then after doing that, you just have to take one derivative-- because after solving the quadratic, you immediately have the general solution-- then you take its derivative, use your initial conditions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You have a system of linear equations which is Algebra I.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you solve them for the two constants, c1 and c2, and you end up with your particular solution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's all there is to it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I will see you in the next video.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: I am Haynes Miller, I am substituting for David Jerison today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have a substitute teacher today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I haven't been here in this class with you so I'm not completely sure where you are.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think you've just been talking about differentiation and you've got some examples of differentiation like these basic examples: the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I think maybe you've spent some time computing the derivative of the sine function as well, recently.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I think you have some rules for extending these calculations as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For instance, I think you know that if you differentiate a constant times a function, what do you get?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: The constant comes outside like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I could write <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's this rule, multiplying by a constant, and I think you also know about differentiating a sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I could write this as <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm going to be using those but today I'll talk about a collection of other rules about how to deal with a product of functions, a quotient of functions, and, best of all, composition of functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then at the end, I'll have something to say about higher derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's the story for today.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the program.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's begin by talking about the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the product rule tells you how to differentiate a product of functions, and I'll just give you the rule, first of all.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The rule is it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's a little bit funny.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Differentiating a product gives you a sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But let's see how that works out in a particular example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, suppose that I wanted to differentiate the product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, the product of these two basic examples that we just talked about.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to use the same variable in both cases instead of different ones like I did here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a new thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We couldn't do this without using the product rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the first function is <EXPRESSION> and the second one is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we're going to apply this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is, according to the rule, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I take <EXPRESSION> and write it down the way it is, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And then I do it the other way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take <EXPRESSION> the way it is, that's <EXPRESSION>, and multiply it by the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "We just saw <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Obviously, you can differentiate longer products, products of more things by doing it one at a time.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see why this is true.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I want to try to show you why the product rule holds.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you have a standard way of trying to understand this, and it involves looking at the change in the function that you're interested in differentiating.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I should look at how much the product <EXPRESSION> changes when <EXPRESSION> changes a little bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, so how do compute the change?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Well, I write down the value of the function at some new value of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I better write down the whole new value of the function, and the function is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the whole new value looks like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the new value.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what's the change in the product?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I better subtract off what the old value was, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "Okay, according to the rule we're trying to prove, I have to get <EXPRESSION> involved.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I want to involve the change in <EXPRESSION> alone, by itself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's just try that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I see part of the formula for the change in <EXPRESSION> right there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see if we can get the rest of it in place.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the change in <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This part of it occurs up here, multiplied by <EXPRESSION>, so let's put that in too.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this equality sign isn't very good right now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've got this product here so far, but I've introduced something I don't like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've introduced <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Minus that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the next thing I'm gonna do is correct that little defect by adding in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, now I cancelled off what was wrong with this line.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm still not quite there, because I haven't put this in yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I better subtract off <EXPRESSION>, and then I'll be home.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But I'm going to do that in a clever way, because I noticed that I already have a <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna take this factor of <EXPRESSION> and make it the same as this factor.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION> times this, <EXPRESSION> times that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "That's the same thing as <EXPRESSION> times the difference.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "So that was a little bit strange, but when you stand back and look at it, you can see multiplied out, the middle terms cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And you get the right answer.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well I like that because it's involved the change in <EXPRESSION> and the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "So this = <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "Well, I'm almost there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The next step in computing the derivative is take difference quotient, divide this by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is well, I'll say <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Have I made a mistake here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This plus magically became a minus on the way down here, so I better fix that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This <EXPRESSION> is this <EXPRESSION> over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've just divided this formula by <EXPRESSION>, and now I can take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, so this is as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This becomes the definition of the derivative, and on this side, I get <EXPRESSION> times.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happens to this quantity when <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this quantity is getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what happens to the value of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It becomes = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That uses continuity of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> by continuity.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this gives me times <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION> times, and <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's the formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the formula as I wrote it down at the beginning over here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of a product is given by this sum.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: How did you get from the first line to the second of the long equation?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: From here to here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: Yes.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: So maybe it's easiest to work backwards and verify that what I wrote down is correct here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, if you look there's a <EXPRESSION> there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's also one here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they occur with opposite signs.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So they cancel.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's just what I started with.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] They cancel right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: I cancelled out this term and this term, and what's left is the ends.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Well, I just calculated what delta uv is, and now I'm gonna divide that by <EXPRESSION> on my way to computing the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so I copied down the right hand side and divided <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I just decided to divide the <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Anything else?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we have the product rule here.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "The rule for differentiating a product of two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is making us stronger.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are many more functions you can find derivatives of now.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about quotients?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's find out how to differentiate a quotient of two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well again, I'll write down what the answer is and then we'll try to verify it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's a quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me write this down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's a quotient of two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the rule for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I always have to think about this and hope that I get it right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This may be the craziest rule you'll see in this course, but there it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'll try to show you why that's true and see an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah there was a hand?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: What letters look the same?", "entities": []}
{"text": "u and v look the same?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll try to make them look more different.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The v's have points on the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "u's have little round things on the bottom.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the new value of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The value of <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the change in <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> gets replaced by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the change in <EXPRESSION>, the new value <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is the new value of <EXPRESSION> divided by the new value of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the beginning.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I subtract off the old values, which are <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This'll be easier to work out when I write it out this way.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now, we'll cross multiply, as I said.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>, now I cross multiply this way, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "And I divide all this by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "Okay, now the reason I like to do it this way is that you see the cancellation happening here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> occur twice and so I can cancel them.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I will, and I'll answer these questions in a minute.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Audience: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Ooh, that's a <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good, anything else?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what all hands were.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, so I cancel these and what I'm left with then is <EXPRESSION> and all this is over <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, there's the difference.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the change in the quotient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The change in this function is given by this formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now to compute the derivative, I want to divide by <EXPRESSION>, and take the limit.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "So let's write that down, <EXPRESSION> is this formula here divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And again, I'm going to put the <EXPRESSION> under these <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm gonna put <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, but I can think of that as dividing into this factor and this factor.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all that is divided by the same denominator, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Put the <EXPRESSION> up in the numerator there.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "Next up, take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "I get, by definition, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "And on the right hand side, well, this is the derivative <EXPRESSION> right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "See and then <EXPRESSION> times, and here it's the derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now what about the denominator?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> stays the same, <EXPRESSION> stays the same.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What happens to this <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "It goes to <EXPRESSION>, again, because <EXPRESSION> is continuous.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So again, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> because they're continuous and you just get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think that's the formula I wrote down over there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And all divided by the square of the old denominator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, that's it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the quotient rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Weird formula.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see an application.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the example I'm going to give is pretty simple.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take the numerator to be just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm gonna take <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now I'm differentiating <EXPRESSION>, the reciprocal of a function; <EXPRESSION> over a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here's a copy of my rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's <EXPRESSION> in that case?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a constant, so that term is <EXPRESSION> in this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I don't have to worry about this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get a minus.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is whatever <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I get a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "So that's the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about sub-example of that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm going to take the special case where <EQUATION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is a power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm gonna use the rule that we developed earlier about the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what do I get here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is, I'm plugging into this formula here with <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get minus, uh, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is, by the rule of exponents, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so let's put these together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's several powers of <EXPRESSION> here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can put them together.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "One of these n's cancels.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I'm left with is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So we've computed the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which I could also write as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "So I've computed the derivative of negative powers of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And this is the formula that I get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If you think of this <EXPRESSION> as a unit, as a thing to itself, it occurs here in the exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It occurs here, and it occurs here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So how does that compare with the formula that we had up here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of a power of <EXPRESSION> is that power times <EXPRESSION> to one less than that power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's exactly the same as the rule that I wrote down here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But the power here happens to be a negative number, and the same negative number shows up as a coefficient and there in the exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Yeah?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: How did I do this?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Where did that <EXPRESSION> come from?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm applying this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the denominator in the quotient rule is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, so the denominator is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I decided to write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the green comments there.", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "What they say is that I can enlarge this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This exact same rule is true for negative values of <EXPRESSION>, as well as positive values of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's something new in your list of rules that you can apply, of values of the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That standard rule is true for negative as well as positive exponents.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that comes out of a quotient rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "Okay, so we've done two rules.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've talked about the product rule and the quotient rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "What's next?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "So this is a composition rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "So the kind of thing that I have in mind, composition of functions is about substitution.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the kind of function that I have in mind is, for instance, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a new one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "We haven't seen how to differentiate that before, I think.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This kind of power of a trig function happens very often.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You've seen them happen, as well, I'm sure, already.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And there's a little notational switch that people use.", "entities": []}
{"text": "They'll write <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But remember that when you write <EXPRESSION>, what you mean is take the sine of <EXPRESSION>, and then take the 10th power of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the meaning of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the method of dealing with this kind of composition of functions is to use new variable names.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What I mean is, I can think of this <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can think of it it as a two step process.", "entities": []}
{"text": "First of all, I compute the sine of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And let's call the result <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There's the new variable name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then, I express <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> says take this and raise it to the tenth power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then you plug <EQUATION> into that, and you get the formula for what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's good practice to introduce new letters when they're convenient, and this is one place where it's very convenient.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's find a rule for differentiating a composition, a function that can be expressed by doing one function and then applying another function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And here's the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, maybe I'll actually derive this rule first, and then you'll see what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In fact, the rule is very simple to derive.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So this is a proof first, and then we'll write down the rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm interested in <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And I'm interested in how <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to the original variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, because of that intermediate variable, I can write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It cancels, right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "The <EXPRESSION> cancels.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The change in that immediate variable cancels out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is just basic algebra.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what happens when I let <EXPRESSION> get small?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "Well this give me <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "On the right-hand side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So students will often remember this rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the rule, by saying that you can cancel out for the dx's.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that's not so far from the truth.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's a good way to think of it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In other words, this is the so-called chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it says that differentiation of a composition is a product.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just the product of the two derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's how you differentiate a composite of two functions.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "And let's just do an example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do this example.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's see how that comes out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's differentiate, what did I say?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, there's an inside function and an outside function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The inside function is <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is the inside function, and this is the outside function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the rule says, first of all let's differentiate the outside function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Take <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "Differentiate it with respect to that variable <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "The outside function is the 10th power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's its derivative?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this account, I'm using this newly introduced variable named <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the derivative of the outside function is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then here's the inside function, and the next thing I want to do is differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what the chain rule gives you.", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "This is correct, but since we were the ones to introduce this notation <EXPRESSION> here, that wasn't given to us in the original problem here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The last step in this process should be to put back, to substitute back in what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that tells me that I get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, times the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "Or the same thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So there's an application of the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "You know, people often wonder where the name chain rule comes from.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I was just wondering about that myself.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So is it because it chains you down?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Is it like a chain fence?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I decided what it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's because by using it, you burst the chains of differentiation, and you can differentiate many more functions using it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So when you want to think of the chain rule, just think of that chain there.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It lets you burst free.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me give you another application of the chain rule.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ready for this one?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'd like to differentiate the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Again, this is the composite of two functions.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the inside function?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so I think I'll introduce this new notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EQUATION>, and the outside function is the sine.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So now the chain rule says <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": ".", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I take the derivative of the outside function, and what's that?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sine prime and we can substitute because we know what sine prime is.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "So I get cosine of whatever, <EXPRESSION>, and then times what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now I differentiate the inside function, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "So I could write this as <EXPRESSION> of what?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, once you get used to this, this middle variable, you don't have to give a name for it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You can just to think about it in your mind without actually writing it down, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll just do it again without introducing this middle variable explicitly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Think about it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I first of all differentiate the outside function, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "But I don't change the thing that I'm plugging into it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's still <EXPRESSION> that I'm plugging into it.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's just write <EXPRESSION> and not worry about the name of that extra variable.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "If it confuses you, introduce the new variable.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And do it carefully and slowly like this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But, quite quickly, I think you'll get to be able to keep that step in your mind.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm not quite done yet.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I haven't differentiated the inside function, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So you get, again, the same result.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A little shortcut that you'll get used to.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Really and truly, once you have the chain rule, the world is yours to conquer.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "It puts you in a very, very powerful position.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, well let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What have I covered today?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I've talked about product rule, quotient rule, composition.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "I should tell you something about higher derivatives, as well.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's do that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is a simple story.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Higher is kind of a strange word.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It just means differentiate over and over again.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "All right, so let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "If we have a function <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, please allow me to just write it as briefly as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, this is a sort of notational thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I can differentiate it and get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "That's a new function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Like if you started with the sine, that's gonna be the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "A new function, so I can differentiate it again.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "And the notation for the differentiating of it again, is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> differentiated again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, if <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Has Professor Jerison talked about what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is?", "entities": []}
{"text": "What is it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ha, okay so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let me go on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What do you suppose <EXPRESSION> means?", "entities": []}
{"text": "I guess it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called the third derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And <EXPRESSION> is called the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's <EXPRESSION> differentiated again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So to compute <EXPRESSION> in this example, what do I do?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "I differentiate that again.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "There's a constant term, <EXPRESSION>, constant factor.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That comes out.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is what?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, so <EQUATION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do it again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now after a while, you get tired of writing these things.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And so maybe I'll use the notation <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "That's the fourth derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or it's <EXPRESSION> differentiated again, the fourth derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what is that in this example?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay, the <EXPRESSION>cosine has derivative minus the <EXPRESSION>, like you told me.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And that minus sign cancels with that sign, and all together, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's pretty bizarre.", "entities": []}
{"text": "When I differentiate the function <EXPRESSION> four times, I get back to the <EXPRESSION> again.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the way it is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now this notation, prime prime prime prime, and things like that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "There are different variants of that notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "For example, that's another notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, you've used the notation <EXPRESSION> before.", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> could also be denoted <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think we've already here, today, used this way of rewriting <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I think when I was talking about <EXPRESSION> and so on, I pulled that <EXPRESSION> outside and put whatever function you're differentiating over to the right.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's just a notational switch.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks good.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It looks like good algebra doesn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "But what it's doing is regarding this notation as an operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's something you apply to a function to get a new function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I apply it to the sine function, and I get the cosine function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "I apply it to <EXPRESSION>, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "This thing here, that symbol, represents an operator, which you apply to a function.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the operator says, take the function and differentiate it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "So further notation that people often use, is they give a different name to that operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And they'll write capital D for it.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "So this is just using capital D for the symbol <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So in terms of that notation, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write down what higher derivatives look like.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "How about <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's write that in terms of the <EXPRESSION> notation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "Well I'm supposed to differentiate <EXPRESSION> right?", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> applied to the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Differentiate the derivative.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "That's what I've done.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or I could write that as <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "Just pulling that <EXPRESSION> outside.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I'm doing <EXPRESSION> twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm doing that operator twice.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I could write that as <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Differentiate twice, and do it to the function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Or, I can write it as, now this is a strange one.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "I could also write as-- like that.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "It's getting stranger and stranger, isn't it?", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is definitely just a kind of abuse of notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But people will go even further and write <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "So this is the strangest one.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This identity quality is the strangest one, because you may think that you're taking <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "But that's not what's intended.", "entities": []}
{"text": "This is not <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's intended is the quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "In this notation, which is very common, what's intended by the denominator is the quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's part of this second differentiation operator.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I've written a bunch of equalities down here, and the only content to them is that these are all different notations for the same thing.", "entities": []}
{"text": "You'll see this notation very commonly.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So for instance the third derivative is <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Sorry?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Yes, absolutely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Or an equally good notation is to write the operator <EXPRESSION>, done three times, to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "Absolutely.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I guess I should also write over here when I was talking about <EXPRESSION>, the second derivative, another notation is do the operator <EXPRESSION> twice.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "Let's see an example of how this can be applied.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll answer this question.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "entities": []}
{"text": "Professor: Yeah, so the question is whether the fourth derivative always gives you the original function back, like what happened here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's very, very special to sines and cosines.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "And, in fact, let's see an example of that.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'll do a calculation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 7}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "Let's calculate the nth derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "Okay, <EXPRESSION> is a number, like <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Here we go.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's do this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, let's do this bit by bit.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "So everybody knows this.", "entities": []}
{"text": "I'm just using a new notation, this capital D notation.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now know, by the way, <EXPRESSION> could be a negative number for that, but for now, for this application, I wanna take <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and so on; one of those numbers.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 119}]}
{"text": "Okay, we did one derivative.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Let's compute the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "Well there's this <EXPRESSION> constant that comes out, and then the exponent comes down, and it gets reduced by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "All right?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Should I do one more?", "entities": []}
{"text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "That's the constant from here.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times that exponent, <EXPRESSION> less, <EXPRESSION> is the new exponent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, I keep on going until I come to a new blackboard.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Now, I think I'm going to stop when I get to the <EXPRESSION> minus first derivative, so we can see what's likely to happen.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "So when I took the third derivative, I had the <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And when I took the second derivative, I had the second power of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So, I think what'll happen when I have the n minus first derivative is I'll have the first power of <EXPRESSION> left over.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The powers of <EXPRESSION> keep coming down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And what I've done it <EXPRESSION> times, I get the first power.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I get a big constant out in front here times more and more and more of these smaller and smaller integers that come down.", "entities": []}
{"text": "What's the last integer that came down before I got <EXPRESSION> here?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Well, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>, because this <EXPRESSION> occurred as the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And the coefficient in front of that is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So that's what you get.", "entities": []}
{"text": "The numbers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and so on down to <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And now we can differentiate one more time and calculate what <EXPRESSION> is.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So I get the same number, <EXPRESSION> and so on and so on, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And then I guess I'll say times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Times, what's the derivative of <EQUATION>, so times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Time <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "Where this one means the constant function <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Does anyone know what this number is called?", "entities": []}
{"text": "That has a name.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's called <EXPRESSION> factorial.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And it's written <EXPRESSION> exclamation point.", "entities": []}
{"text": "And we just used an example of mathematical induction.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So the end result is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay that's a neat fact.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Final question for the lecture is what's <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"text": "Ha.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Excellent.", "entities": []}
{"text": "It's the derivative of a constant.", "entities": []}
{"text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Okay.", "entities": []}
{"text": "Thank you.", "entities": []}
