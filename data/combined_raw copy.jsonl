{"id": 7708, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7709, "text": "That's how far <EXPRESSION> moves.", "label": []}
{"id": 7710, "text": "That's the change in <EXPRESSION> That's what I said up in the right hand corner there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7711, "text": "Oops.", "label": []}
{"id": 7712, "text": "Alright, that's not a good idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 7713, "text": "Alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 7714, "text": "And now I want to draw the diagram again <EXPRESSION> time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7715, "text": "And now what I'd like to do is draw this curve here which is a piece of the arc of the circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 7716, "text": "But really what I want to keep in mind is something that I did also in all these other arguments.", "label": []}
{"id": 7717, "text": "Which is, maybe I should have called this orange, that I'm gonna think of the straight line between.", "label": []}
{"id": 7718, "text": "So it's the straight line approximation to the curve that we're always interested in.", "label": []}
{"id": 7719, "text": "So the straight line is much simpler, because then we just have a triangle here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7720, "text": "And in fact it's a right triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 7721, "text": "Right, so we have the geometry of a right triangle which is going to now let us do all of our calculations.", "label": []}
{"id": 7722, "text": "That distance there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7723, "text": "So next thing we need is the exponential distribution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7724, "text": "We've been talking about continuous distributions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7725, "text": "We talked about the uniform and the normal.", "label": []}
{"id": 7726, "text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> famous continuous distributions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7727, "text": "We've already done all the discrete distributions we need for the entire semester.", "label": []}
{"id": 7728, "text": "But we only have <EXPRESSION> continuous distributions, so we kinda have to catch up on the continuous stuff, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7729, "text": "So the next most important <EXPRESSION> is called the exponential distribution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7730, "text": "And that's <EXPRESSION> of the biggest topics for the next homework, and it's <EXPRESSION> of the most important distributions in general.", "label": []}
{"id": 7731, "text": "Now we've already seen the exponential distribution, A couple of times, it's just like as part on the previous homework with waiting for the book to be released.", "label": []}
{"id": 7732, "text": "And I used it to illustrate Universality of the Uniform, but we haven't formally introduced it yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 7733, "text": "So this will be our formal introduction of exponential distribution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7736, "text": "That's the traditional and I'm gonna call this a rate parameter.", "label": []}
{"id": 7737, "text": "Because you don't have to call it lambda, it's just lambda's the usual terminology.", "label": []}
{"id": 7738, "text": "I'm gonna call it a rate parameter, because intuitively we can think of it as the rate at which some type of event occurs, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7741, "text": "But what special about this <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7742, "text": "Okay, so we say <EXPRESSION> is exponential lambda, That's our notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7744, "text": "So it's always positive, so continuous positive random variable, that's the PDF.", "label": []}
{"id": 7745, "text": "You can see why it's called the exponential distribution, cuz there's an exponential function with a couple constants stuck in there, exponential decay.", "label": []}
{"id": 7747, "text": "And I get <EXPRESSION> just integrating exponential, so that means it's valid.", "label": []}
{"id": 7749, "text": "Then we can talk more about what are the special properties of this distribution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7751, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> = the integral, so I will start the integral at <EXPRESSION> because this is a positive random variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 7752, "text": "<EXPRESSION> up to <EXPRESSION> of lambda <EXPRESSION>, again that's a very easy integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 7753, "text": "And I will just get <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, for <EXPRESSION> greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7754, "text": "It's easy to check that this is correct, cuz if you take the derivative of this, lambda comes down and you get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7757, "text": "If you go that way, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7758, "text": "And approaches <EXPRESSION>, if you go that way.", "label": []}
{"id": 7761, "text": "Actually an easier way to get the mean, of course we can just write down the integral and do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7762, "text": "But before we do that it's useful to try to standardize it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7763, "text": "So remember what the normal, we can reduce any normal to a standard normal.", "label": []}
{"id": 7766, "text": "And we're gonna show right now that if we let <EXPRESSION> =, <EXPRESSION>, Then we're gonna show that <EXPRESSION> is exponential of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7767, "text": "So that's kind of analagous to standardization of the standard normal.", "label": []}
{"id": 7768, "text": "And that we're multiplying, I mean it's not exactly the same cuz for the normal we subtracted the mean by a standard deviation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7769, "text": "Here, we're just saying multiply by something to make it exponential of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7770, "text": "Because if I can get exponential of <EXPRESSION>, it's gonna be a lot easier, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7771, "text": "Then if the lambda's are not there, so how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 7772, "text": "So since, let's just do a quick calculation to show that that's true, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7773, "text": "Cuz once we have this relationship, than a lot of the times we can just work with exponential of <EXPRESSION>, and then stick in the lambda when we need it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7774, "text": "So let's just compute the CDF of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7775, "text": "<EXPRESSION> less than or = <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7776, "text": "It's just this is an very easy calculation if you understand CDFs, that the CDF of <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION> is lambda <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7777, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> less than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7779, "text": "So if we take the CDF and plug in <EXPRESSION>, then we just get <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7780, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7781, "text": "That's the CDF of an exponential of <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7782, "text": "I just plugged in <EXPRESSION> here, and <EXPRESSION> cancel, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7783, "text": "So it's just that <EXPRESSION> short equation proves that his statement is true.", "label": []}
{"id": 7785, "text": "And find the mean and variance, and then we can get the general case, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7786, "text": "So let's do that case now, so we're letting <EXPRESSION> be exponential of <EXPRESSION>, And we wanna find the mean and variance, Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7787, "text": "So let's get the mean <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7788, "text": "Just by definition, Expect the value <EXPRESSION>, so it's just the integral of <EXPRESSION> times the PDFF <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7789, "text": "Okay, now this is a very standard integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 7790, "text": "This is the kind of interval you'd see in AP calculus when you're learning integration by parts, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7791, "text": "So all we have to do is let <EQUATION> and let <EXPRESSION> = this part.", "label": []}
{"id": 7792, "text": "Remember your integration by parts, <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7793, "text": "<EQUATION> and <EXPRESSION> = just integrate this thing, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7794, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7795, "text": "So now I'm just gonna do a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7796, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> evaluated from <EXPRESSION> ero to <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7797, "text": "So it's gonna be plus the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7798, "text": "So now we've made it into an easy integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 7799, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> part is <EXPRESSION>, because if we plug in <EQUATION>, we just get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7801, "text": "So the exponential part's dominant.", "label": []}
{"id": 7802, "text": "So this part is just <EXPRESSION>, and this part, it's just <EXPRESSION>, cuz that's an easy integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 7803, "text": "Or an even cuter way to do it is to say, we're integrating the exponential <EXPRESSION> PDF it has to be <EXPRESSION>, otherwise that wasn't a valid PDF.", "label": []}
{"id": 7804, "text": "So in this course, there are actually a lot of integrals, we can do not using calculus directly, but by recognizing that's a PDF or that kind of thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7805, "text": "Of course that's an easy integral anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 7806, "text": "Okay, therefore the mean is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7807, "text": "Now for the variance, For the variance, we can just do <EXPRESSION> the other way as usual.", "label": []}
{"id": 7808, "text": "So here is the LOTUS,<EXPRESSION> while by LOTUS, it's immediate of that integral of <EXPRESSION> this thing we just computed as <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7809, "text": "Now this integer, well then we have to use integration by parts again.", "label": []}
{"id": 7810, "text": "And I'm not gonna write out the integration by parts again, probably because we're gonna learn better ways to do this later.", "label": []}
{"id": 7811, "text": "Or we're gonna actually avoid doing this, and get them movements a different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 7812, "text": "So this is called the <EXPRESSION> moment by the way, <EXPRESSION> is called the <EXPRESSION> movement, that is called the <EXPRESSION> movement.", "label": []}
{"id": 7813, "text": "Okay, but this is an easy integration by parts in the sense that if let <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7814, "text": "Basically it's gonna reduce reduce it back down in to an integral that looks like this, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7815, "text": "It's gonna lower the power from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, so this is like when you're doing integration by parts twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 7816, "text": "You don't actually have to do it twice, cuz you do it once and then you reduce it to the <EXPRESSION> we just did.", "label": []}
{"id": 7817, "text": "So you're actually doing integration by parts once.", "label": []}
{"id": 7818, "text": "And wwe do that we also get <EXPRESSION> and that's pretty easy to remember, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7819, "text": "So now coming back to this general exponential, So just continuing the notation here, <EQUATION>, so <EQUATION> and that's gonna have, The mean, just take expected value of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7820, "text": "Lambda is a constant that comes out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7821, "text": "So it has mean <EXPRESSION>, and it has variance.", "label": []}
{"id": 7822, "text": "Well for the variance, take the variance of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7823, "text": "Remember the variance constant comes out squared.", "label": []}
{"id": 7824, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>, but the variance of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7825, "text": "So the variance is <EXPRESSION>d.", "label": []}
{"id": 7826, "text": "Okay, so now we know the mean and the variance.", "label": []}
{"id": 7827, "text": "We do not yet know why the exponential is important, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7828, "text": "And there's different reasons why it's important.", "label": []}
{"id": 7829, "text": "But what I consider the most important reason is what's called the memory list property.", "label": []}
{"id": 7830, "text": "And you've already seen the memory list property in the discrete case, if you did that practice mid-term question.", "label": []}
{"id": 7831, "text": "But we haven't talked about it in the continuous case.", "label": []}
{"id": 7832, "text": "So memoryless property, So exponential distribution is memoryless.", "label": []}
{"id": 7833, "text": "I have to tell you what that means, and then check that is true, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7834, "text": "So memoryless property means that, See if we can remember that midterm practice problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 7835, "text": "What is said something about memorylessness, it said no matter how long you've waited then it's like you're starting over from fresh, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7836, "text": "I think that's what it said, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7837, "text": "So it says that if you have a random variable that, intuitively it's a random variable that we interpret as a waiting time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7838, "text": "So you're waiting for something to happen, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7839, "text": "No, just have a concrete example in mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 7840, "text": "Suppose you're just waiting for a phone call, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7841, "text": "So now is time <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7842, "text": "And you're waiting to get a call, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7843, "text": "Which could come at any time in continuous time, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7844, "text": "The geometric is discrete like flipping coins waiting for success, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7845, "text": "Bernoulli trials wait for success in discrete times cuz they have discrete trials.", "label": []}
{"id": 7846, "text": "This is in continuous time, you're waiting for the phone call.", "label": []}
{"id": 7847, "text": "And suppose that this waiting time has the property that no matter how long you waited, just like that time is gone.", "label": []}
{"id": 7848, "text": "It's not giving you progress towards getting your phone call.", "label": []}
{"id": 7849, "text": "It's like starting from fresh every time, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7850, "text": "That's what the memoryless property means.", "label": []}
{"id": 7851, "text": "So as an equation, what it says is the probability that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION> given that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7852, "text": "Imagine that <EXPRESSION> is measured in minutes or whatever unit you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 7853, "text": "This says you've already waited at least <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 7854, "text": "You've already waited <EXPRESSION> minutes, and you haven't gotten your phone call.", "label": []}
{"id": 7855, "text": "So you know <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 7856, "text": "And then what's the probability you would have to wait at least an additional <EXPRESSION> minutes?", "label": []}
{"id": 7857, "text": "Is just the same as the probability X is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7858, "text": "Because you've started over with the fresh exponential distribution with the same parameter.", "label": []}
{"id": 7859, "text": "That's the definition of the memoryless property, but I hope that this equation kind of intuitively make sense to capture that intuition of memorylessness.", "label": []}
{"id": 7860, "text": "Okay, so now let's prove that in fact that this equation is satisfied by the exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 7861, "text": "So for the exponential lambda, this is the general definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 7862, "text": "But now we're assuming <EXPRESSION> is exponential lambda and let's check that the equation holds.", "label": []}
{"id": 7863, "text": "So let's find the probability that <EXPRESSION> is greater than or = <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7864, "text": "We don't have to worry about whether it's strict inequality here, cuz it's a continuous random variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 7865, "text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>, and this is the <EXPRESSION>, this is called the survival survival function.", "label": []}
{"id": 7866, "text": "Because what'ss the probability that, if you think of <EXPRESSION> rather than thinking of a waiting time thinking of it as like how long someone is gonna live?", "label": []}
{"id": 7867, "text": "And then that's the probability that they will live more than at least s seconds, so that's a survival thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7868, "text": "So this is actually extremely important in what's called survival analysis in bio statistics, as well as in engineering.", "label": []}
{"id": 7869, "text": "You wanna figure out how long is a certain piece of electronic's gonna last, things like that, then you need to look at survival functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7870, "text": "Well anyway that's just <EXPRESSION>, But the CDF was <EXPRESSION>, so that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7871, "text": "We've already seen scenarios where we start with a differential equation and then we generate a slope field that describes the solutions to the differential equation and then we use that to visualize those solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7872, "text": "What I want to do in this video is do an exercise that takes us the other way, start with a slope field and figure out which differential equation is the slope field describing the solutions for.", "label": []}
{"id": 7873, "text": "And so I encourage you to look at each of these options and think about which of these differential equations is being described by this slope field.", "label": []}
{"id": 7874, "text": "I encourage you to pause the video right now and try it on your own.", "label": []}
{"id": 7875, "text": "So I'm assuming you have had a go at it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7876, "text": "So let's work through each of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 7877, "text": "And the way I'm going to do it is I'm just going to find some points that seem to be easy to do arithmetic with, and we'll see if the slope described by the differential equation at that point is consistent with the slope depicted in the slope field.", "label": []}
{"id": 7878, "text": "And, I don't know, just for simplicity, le's define <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> for all of these.", "label": []}
{"id": 7879, "text": "So, when <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7880, "text": "So, this <EXPRESSION> differential equation right over here, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> would be negative <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION> or negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7881, "text": "<EXPRESSION> would be negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7882, "text": "Now, is that depicted here?", "label": []}
{"id": 7883, "text": "When <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, our slope isn't negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7884, "text": "Our slope here looks positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 7885, "text": "So we can rule this <EXPRESSION> out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7886, "text": "Now, let's try the next <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7887, "text": "So, if <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, well then <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7888, "text": "And, once again, I just picked <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION> for convenience.", "label": []}
{"id": 7889, "text": "I could have picked any other.", "label": []}
{"id": 7890, "text": "I could have picked negative <EXPRESSION> and negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7891, "text": "This just makes the arithmetic a little easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 7892, "text": "Once again, when you look at that point that we've already looked at, our slope is clearly not <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7893, "text": "We have a positive slope here, so we can rule that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7894, "text": "Once again, for this magenta differential equation, if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are both = <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> is once again going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7895, "text": "And we've already seen this slope is not <EXPRESSION> here, so rule that <EXPRESSION> out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7896, "text": "And now here we have <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>, so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, our derivate of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7897, "text": "Now, this looks interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 7898, "text": "It looks like this slope right over here could be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7899, "text": "This looks like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7900, "text": "This looks like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7901, "text": "I would want to validate some other points, but this looks like a really, really good candidate.", "label": []}
{"id": 7902, "text": "And you can also see what is happening here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7904, "text": "And we see that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7905, "text": "If we were to just hold <EXPRESSION> constant at <EXPRESSION> but increase <EXPRESSION> along this line, we see that the slope is increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7906, "text": "It is getting steeper.", "label": []}
{"id": 7907, "text": "And if we were to keep <EXPRESSION> constant and increase <EXPRESSION> across this line, we see that the slope increases.", "label": []}
{"id": 7908, "text": "And, in general, we see that the slope increases as we go to the top right.", "label": []}
{"id": 7909, "text": "And we see that it decreases as we go to the bottom left and both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> become much, much more negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 7910, "text": "So, I'm feeling pretty good about this, especially if we can knock this <EXPRESSION> out here, if we can knock that <EXPRESSION> out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7911, "text": "So, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7912, "text": "Well, then when <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION>, and this slope looks larger than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7913, "text": "It looks like <EXPRESSION>, but since we are really just eyeballing it, let's see if we can find something where this more clearly falls apart.", "label": []}
{"id": 7914, "text": "So, let's look at the situation when they both = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7915, "text": "So, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7916, "text": "Well, in that case, <EXPRESSION> should still be = <EXPRESSION> because you have negative <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7917, "text": "Do we see that over here?", "label": []}
{"id": 7918, "text": "So, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7919, "text": "Our derivative here looks negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 7920, "text": "It looks like negative <EXPRESSION>, which is consistent with this yellow differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7921, "text": "The slope here is definitely not a positive <EXPRESSION>, so we could rule this <EXPRESSION> out as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 7922, "text": "And so we should feel pretty confident that this is the differential equation being described.", "label": []}
{"id": 7923, "text": "And now that we've done it, we can actually think about well, okay, what are the solutions for this differential equation going to look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 7924, "text": "Well, it depends where they start or what points they contain.", "label": []}
{"id": 7925, "text": "If you have a solution that contains that point, it looks like it might do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7926, "text": "If you had a solution that contained this point, it might do something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7927, "text": "And, of course, it keeps going.", "label": []}
{"id": 7928, "text": "It looks like it would asymptote towards <EQUATION>, this downward sloping.", "label": []}
{"id": 7929, "text": "This essentially is the line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7930, "text": "Actually, no that is not the line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7931, "text": "This is the line <EQUATION>, so that's this line right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7932, "text": "And it looks like if the solution contained, say, this point right over here, that would actually be a solution to the differential equation <EQUATION> and you can verify that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7934, "text": "Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 7935, "text": "Right now, we're finishing up with the <EXPRESSION> unit, and I'd like to continue in this lecture, lecture <EXPRESSION>, with some final remarks about exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 7936, "text": "So what I'd like to do is just review something that I did quickly last time, and make a few philosophical remarks about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7937, "text": "I think that the steps involved were maybe a little tricky, and so I'd like to go through it <EXPRESSION> more time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7939, "text": "And what we showed was that the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7940, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> thing that I'd like to do is just explain the proof a little bit more clearly than I did last time with fewer symbols, or at least with this abbreviation of the symbol here, to show you what we actually did.", "label": []}
{"id": 7941, "text": "So I'll just remind you of what we did last time, and the <EXPRESSION> observation was to check, rather than the limit of this function, but to take the log <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7942, "text": "And this is typically what's done when you have an exponential, when you have an exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 7943, "text": "And what we found was that the limit here was <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7944, "text": "So last time, this is what we did.", "label": []}
{"id": 7945, "text": "And I just wanted to be careful and show you exactly what the next step is.", "label": []}
{"id": 7946, "text": "If you exponentiate this fact; you take <EXPRESSION> to this power, that's going to tend to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7947, "text": "And then, we just observe that this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7948, "text": "So the basic ingredient here is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7949, "text": "That's because the log function is the inverse of the exponential function.", "label": []}
{"id": 7950, "text": "Yes, question?", "label": []}
{"id": 7952, "text": "Who said it was?", "label": []}
{"id": 7957, "text": "We don't really know yet from this expression, in fact we did some cleverness with limits and derivatives, to figure out this limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 7958, "text": "It was a very subtle thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7960, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7961, "text": "Now, the thing that I'd like to say - I'm sorry I'm going to erase this aside here - but you need to go back to your notes and remember that this is what we did last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7962, "text": "Because I want to have room for the next comment that I want to make on this little blackboard here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7963, "text": "What we just derived was this property here, but I made a claim yesterday, and I just want to emphasize it again so that we realized what it is that we're doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7964, "text": "I looked at this backwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 7965, "text": "<EXPRESSION> way you can think of this is we're evaluating this limit and getting an answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 7966, "text": "But all equalities can be read both directions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7967, "text": "And we can write it the other way: <EQUATION>, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of this expression here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7968, "text": "So that's just the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7969, "text": "And if we read it backwards, what we're saying is that this limit is a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7970, "text": "So this is very typical of mathematics.", "label": []}
{"id": 7971, "text": "You want to always reverse your perspective all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7972, "text": "Equations work both ways, and in this case, we have <EXPRESSION> different things here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7973, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> was what we defined as the base, which when you graph <EXPRESSION>, you get slope <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7974, "text": "And then it turns out to be = this limit, which we can calculate numerically.", "label": []}
{"id": 7975, "text": "If you do this on your calculators, you, of course, will have a way of programming in this number and evaluating it for each <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7976, "text": "And you'll have another button available to evaluate this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7977, "text": "So another way of saying it is it that there's a relationship between these <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 7978, "text": "And all of calculus is a matter of getting these relationships.", "label": []}
{"id": 7979, "text": "So we can look at these things in several different ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 7980, "text": "And indeed, that's what we're going to be doing at least at the end of today in talking about derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7981, "text": "A lot of times when we talk about derivatives, we're trying to look at them from several perspectives at once.", "label": []}
{"id": 7982, "text": "Okay, so I have to keep on going with exponents, because I have <EXPRESSION> loose end.", "label": []}
{"id": 7983, "text": "<EXPRESSION> loose end that I did not cover yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 7984, "text": "There's <EXPRESSION> very important formula that's left, and it's the derivative of the powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 7985, "text": "We actually didn't do this - well we did it for rational numbers <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7986, "text": "So this is the formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7987, "text": "But now we're going to check this for all real numbers, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7988, "text": "So including all the irrational ones as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 7989, "text": "This is also good practice for using base <EXPRESSION> and using logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7990, "text": "So let me do this by our <EXPRESSION> methods that we can use to handle exponential type problems.", "label": []}
{"id": 7992, "text": "So if I just rewrite this base <EXPRESSION> again, that's just this formula over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7993, "text": "<EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7994, "text": "Okay, so now I can differentiate this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7995, "text": "So I get that <EXPRESSION>, now I'm going to use prime notation, because I don't want to keep on writing that <EXPRESSION> here; <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7996, "text": "And now, what I can do is I can use the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 7997, "text": "The chain rule says that it's the derivative of this times the derivative of the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 7998, "text": "So the derivative of the exponential is just itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 7999, "text": "And the derivative of this guy here, well I'll write it out once, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8000, "text": "So what's that =?", "label": []}
{"id": 8001, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8002, "text": "And this derivative here is Well the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8003, "text": "This is a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8004, "text": "It just factors out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8005, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> now has derivative What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8006, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, so this is going to be times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8007, "text": "And now, we rewrite it in the customary form, which is <EXPRESSION>, we put the <EXPRESSION> in front, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8008, "text": "Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 8009, "text": "So I just derived the formula for you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8010, "text": "And it didn't matter whether <EXPRESSION> was rational or irrational, it's the same proof.", "label": []}
{"id": 8011, "text": "Okay so now I have to show you how method <EXPRESSION> works as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 8012, "text": "So let's do method <EXPRESSION>, which we call logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8014, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8015, "text": "And now I differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8016, "text": "I'll leave that in the middle, because I want to remember the key property of logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8017, "text": "But <EXPRESSION> I'll differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8018, "text": "Later on, what I'm going to use is that this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8019, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION> way of evaluating a logarithmic derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8020, "text": "And then the other is to differentiate the explicit function that we have over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8021, "text": "And that is just, as we said, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8023, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8024, "text": "Again, you can now see by comparing these <EXPRESSION> pieces of arithmetic that they're basically the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 8025, "text": "Pretty much every time you convert to base <EXPRESSION> or you do logarithmic differentiation, it'll amount to the same thing, provided you don't get mixed up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8026, "text": "You generally have to introduce a new symbol here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8027, "text": "On the other hand, you're dealing with exponents there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8028, "text": "It's worth it to know both points of view.", "label": []}
{"id": 8029, "text": "All right, so now I want to make <EXPRESSION> last remark before we finish with exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8030, "text": "And, I'll try to sell this to you in a lot of ways as the course goes on, but <EXPRESSION> thing that I want to try to emphasize is that the natural logarithm really is natural.", "label": []}
{"id": 8031, "text": "So, I claim that the natural log is natural.", "label": []}
{"id": 8032, "text": "And the example that we're going to use for this illustration is economics.", "label": []}
{"id": 8033, "text": "Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 8035, "text": "If you are imagining the price of a stock that you own goes down by a dollar, that's a totally meaningless statement.", "label": []}
{"id": 8036, "text": "It depends on a lot of things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8037, "text": "In particular, it depends on whether the original price was a dollar or <EXPRESSION> dollars.", "label": []}
{"id": 8038, "text": "So there's not much meaning to these absolute numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8039, "text": "It's always the ratios that matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 8040, "text": "So, for example, I just looked up an hour ago, the London Exchange closed, and it was down <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8041, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, which as I said, is pretty meaningless unless you know what the actual total of this index is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8042, "text": "It turns out it was <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8043, "text": "So the change in the price, divided by the price, which in this case is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8044, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, is what matters.", "label": []}
{"id": 8045, "text": "And, in this case, it happens to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 8046, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8047, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8048, "text": "That's what happened today.", "label": []}
{"id": 8050, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8051, "text": "That's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8052, "text": "So this is the - let me put a little box around it - the formula of logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8053, "text": "But let me just emphasize that it has an actual significance, and it's the <EXPRESSION> that's used by economists and people who are modeling prices of things all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8054, "text": "They never use absolute prices when there are large swings.", "label": []}
{"id": 8055, "text": "They always use the log of the price.", "label": []}
{"id": 8056, "text": "And there's no point in using <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8057, "text": "Those give you junk.", "label": []}
{"id": 8058, "text": "They give you an extra factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8059, "text": "It's the natural log that's the obvious <EXPRESSION> to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 8060, "text": "It's completely straightforward that this is a simpler expression than using <EXPRESSION> and having a factor of <EXPRESSION> there, which would just mess everything up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8061, "text": "All right, so this is just <EXPRESSION> illustration.", "label": []}
{"id": 8062, "text": "Anything that has to do with ratios is going to encounter logarithms.", "label": []}
{"id": 8063, "text": "All right, so that's pretty much it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8064, "text": "That's all I want to say for now anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 8065, "text": "There's lots more to say, but we'll be saying it when we do applications of derivatives in the <EXPRESSION> unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8066, "text": "So now, what I'd like to do is to start a review.", "label": []}
{"id": 8067, "text": "I'm just going to run through what we did in this unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8068, "text": "I'll tell you approximately what I expect from you on the test that's coming up tomorrow.", "label": []}
{"id": 8069, "text": "And, well, so let's get started with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8070, "text": "So this is a review of Unit <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8071, "text": "And I'm just going to put on the board all of the things that you need to think about, anyway, keep in your head.", "label": []}
{"id": 8072, "text": "And there are what are called general formulas for derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8073, "text": "And then there are the specific ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 8074, "text": "And let me just remind you what the general formulas are.", "label": []}
{"id": 8075, "text": "There's what you do to differentiate a sum, a multiple of a function, the product rule, the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8076, "text": "Those are several general formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8077, "text": "And then there's <EXPRESSION> more, which is the chain rule, which I'm going to say just a little bit more about.", "label": []}
{"id": 8078, "text": "So the derivative of a function of a function is the derivative of the function times the derivative of the other function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8079, "text": "So here, I've abbreviated <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8080, "text": "Right, so this is <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> ways of writing it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8081, "text": "The other way is also <EXPRESSION> that you can keep in mind and you might find easier to remember.", "label": []}
{"id": 8082, "text": "It's probably a good idea to remember both formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8083, "text": "And then the last type of general formula that we did was implicit differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8084, "text": "Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 8085, "text": "So when you do implicit differentiation, you have an equation and you don't try to solve for the unknown function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8086, "text": "You just put it in its simplest form and you differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8087, "text": "So, we actually did this, in particular, for inverses.", "label": []}
{"id": 8088, "text": "That was a very, very key method for calculating the inverses of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8089, "text": "And it's also true that logarithmic differentiation is of this type.", "label": []}
{"id": 8090, "text": "This is a transformation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8091, "text": "We're differentiating something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8092, "text": "We're transforming the equation by taking its logarithm and then differentiating.", "label": []}
{"id": 8093, "text": "Okay, so there are a number of different ways this is applied.", "label": []}
{"id": 8094, "text": "It can also be applied, anyway, these are <EXPRESSION> of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8095, "text": "So maybe in parenthesis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8096, "text": "These are just examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 8097, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8098, "text": "I'll try to give examples of at least a few of these rules later.", "label": []}
{"id": 8099, "text": "So now, the specific functions that you know how to differentiate: well you know how to differentiate now <EXPRESSION> thanks to what I just did.", "label": []}
{"id": 8104, "text": "But what you'll find is that it's much more convenient to remember the derivatives of these as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 8105, "text": "So memorize all of these.", "label": []}
{"id": 8106, "text": "All right, and then we had <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8107, "text": "And we had the inverses of the trig functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8109, "text": "So those are the ones you're responsible for.", "label": []}
{"id": 8110, "text": "You should have enough time, anyway, to work out anything else, if you know these.", "label": []}
{"id": 8111, "text": "All right, so basically the idea is you have a bunch of special formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8112, "text": "You have a bunch of general formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8113, "text": "You put them together, and you can generate pretty much anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 8114, "text": "Okay, so let's do a few examples before going on with the review.", "label": []}
{"id": 8115, "text": "Okay, so I do want to do a few examples in sort of increasing level of difficulty in how you would combine these things together.", "label": []}
{"id": 8116, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> of all, you should remember that if you differentiate the <EXPRESSION> function, that's just - oh I just realized that I wanted to say something else before - so forget that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8117, "text": "We'll do that in a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8118, "text": "I wanted to make some general remarks.", "label": []}
{"id": 8119, "text": "So there's <EXPRESSION> rule that you discussed in my absence, which is the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8120, "text": "And I do want to make just a couple of remarks about the chain rule now to remind you of what it is, and also to present some consequences.", "label": []}
{"id": 8121, "text": "So, a little bit of extra on the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8122, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing that I want say is that we didn't really fully explain why it's true.", "label": []}
{"id": 8123, "text": "And I do want to just explain it by example, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 8124, "text": "So imagine that you have a function which is, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8125, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8126, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8127, "text": "Then obviously, <EXPRESSION> is changing <EXPRESSION> times as fast as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8128, "text": "The issue is this number here, <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8129, "text": "And now if <EXPRESSION> is a function of something, say <EXPRESSION>, shifted by some other constant here, then <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8132, "text": "Now these terms don't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 8133, "text": "The constant terms don't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 8134, "text": "The rate is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8135, "text": "And so the consequence, if we put them together, is that <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8136, "text": "All right, so this is in a nutshell why the chain rule works.", "label": []}
{"id": 8137, "text": "And why these rates multiply.", "label": []}
{"id": 8138, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> thing that I wanted to say about the chain rule is that it has a few consequences that make some of the other rules a little easier to remember or possibly to avoid.", "label": []}
{"id": 8139, "text": "The messiest rule in my humble opinion is the quotient rule, which is kind of a nuisance to remember.", "label": []}
{"id": 8140, "text": "So let me just remind you, if you take just the reciprocal of a function, and you differentiate it, there's another way of looking at this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8141, "text": "And it's actually the way that I use, so I want to encourage you to think about it this way too.", "label": []}
{"id": 8142, "text": "This is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8144, "text": "And now instead of using the quotient rule, which we could've used, we can use the chain rule here with the power <EXPRESSION>, which works by the power law.", "label": []}
{"id": 8145, "text": "So what is this =?", "label": []}
{"id": 8146, "text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8147, "text": "So here, I've applied the chain rule rather than the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8148, "text": "And similarly, suppose I wanted to derive the full quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8149, "text": "Well, now this may or may not be easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 8150, "text": "But this is <EXPRESSION> way of remembering what's going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8151, "text": "If you convert it to <EXPRESSION> and you differentiate that, now I can use the product rule on this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8152, "text": "Of course, I have to use the chain rule and this rule as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 8153, "text": "So what do I get?", "label": []}
{"id": 8154, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION>, the inverse, plus <EXPRESSION>, and then I have to differentiate the <EXPRESSION> inverse.", "label": []}
{"id": 8155, "text": "That's the formula right up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8156, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8157, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8158, "text": "This actually explains the funny minus sign when you differentiate <EXPRESSION> in the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8159, "text": "The other formula, the other way that we did it, was by putting this over a common denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 8160, "text": "The common denominator was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8161, "text": "This comes from this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8162, "text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> term is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8163, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> term, we have to multiply by an extra factor of <EXPRESSION>, because we have a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 8164, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8165, "text": "All right, so this is the quotient rule as we wrote it down in lecture, and this is just another way of remembering it or deriving it without remembering it, if you just remember the chain rule and the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8166, "text": "Okay, so you'll find that in many contexts, it's easier to do <EXPRESSION> or the other.", "label": []}
{"id": 8167, "text": "Okay, so now I'm ready to differentiate the secant and a few such functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8168, "text": "So we'll do some examples here here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8170, "text": "This is the way I think of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8172, "text": "And so, the formula here is just what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8173, "text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8174, "text": "So now this is usually written in a different fashion, so that's why I'm doing this for a reason actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 8175, "text": "Which is although there are several formulas for things, with trig functions, there are usually <EXPRESSION> ways of writing something.", "label": []}
{"id": 8176, "text": "So I'm writing this <EXPRESSION> down so that you know what the standard way of presenting it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8177, "text": "So what happens here is that we have <EXPRESSION> minus signs cancelling.", "label": []}
{"id": 8178, "text": "And we get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8179, "text": "That's a perfectly acceptable answer, but there's a customary way in which is written.", "label": []}
{"id": 8180, "text": "It's written <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8182, "text": "So this is the form that's generally used when you see these formulas written in textbooks.", "label": []}
{"id": 8183, "text": "And so you know, you need to watch out, because if you ever want to use this kind of calculus, you'll have not be put off by all the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8184, "text": "All right, so getting slightly more complicated, how about if we differentiate <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8185, "text": "If you differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8186, "text": "And plugging in the formula that we had before, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8187, "text": "So this <EXPRESSION> also has a very nice form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8188, "text": "And you might say that this is kind of an ugly function, but the strange thing is that the natural log was invented before the exponential by a guy named Napier, exactly in order to evaluate functions like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8189, "text": "These are the functions that people cared about a lot, because they were used in navigation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8191, "text": "And the multiplication he encoded using a logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 8192, "text": "So these were invented long before people even knew about exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8193, "text": "And it was a surprise, actually, that it was connected to exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8194, "text": "So the natural log was invented before the <EXPRESSION> and everything else, exactly for this kind of purpose.", "label": []}
{"id": 8195, "text": "Anyway, so this is a nice function, which was very important, so that your ships wouldn't crash into the reef.", "label": []}
{"id": 8196, "text": "Okay, let's continue here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8197, "text": "So there's another kind of function that I want to discuss with you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8198, "text": "And these are the kinds in which there's a choice as to which of these rules to apply.", "label": []}
{"id": 8199, "text": "And I'll just give a couple of examples of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8200, "text": "There usually is a better and a worse way, so let me illustrate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8201, "text": "Okay, yet another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8202, "text": "I hope you've seen some of these before.", "label": []}
{"id": 8203, "text": "Say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8204, "text": "So it's a little bit more complicated than what we had before, because there were several more symbols here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8205, "text": "So what should we do at this point?", "label": []}
{"id": 8206, "text": "There's <EXPRESSION> choice which I claim is a bad idea, and that is to expand this out to the <EXPRESSION> power.", "label": []}
{"id": 8207, "text": "That's a bad idea, because it's very long.", "label": []}
{"id": 8208, "text": "And then your answer will also be very long.", "label": []}
{"id": 8209, "text": "It will fill the entire exam paper, for instance.", "label": []}
{"id": 8210, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 8211, "text": "That's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8212, "text": "We use the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8213, "text": "So fortunately, this is relatively easy using the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8214, "text": "We just think of this box as being the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8215, "text": "And we take <EXPRESSION> times this guy to the <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of this guy, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8216, "text": "And this is, filling this in, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8217, "text": "And that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8218, "text": "That's all you need to do differentiate things like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8219, "text": "The chain rule is very effective.", "label": []}
{"id": 8220, "text": "So I'm not really willing to answer too many questions about what's going to be on the exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 8221, "text": "But the question that was just asked is exactly the kind of question I'm very happy to answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 8222, "text": "Okay, the question was, in what form is what form is an acceptable answer?", "label": []}
{"id": 8223, "text": "Now in real life, that is a really serious question.", "label": []}
{"id": 8224, "text": "When you ask a computer a question and it gives you <EXPRESSION> sheets of printout, it's useless.", "label": []}
{"id": 8225, "text": "And you really care what form answers are in, and indeed, somebody might really care what this thing to the <EXPRESSION> power is, and then you would be forced to discuss things in terms of that other functional form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8226, "text": "For the purposes of this exam, this is okay form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8227, "text": "And, in fact, any correct form is an okay form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8228, "text": "I recommend strongly that you not try to simplify things unless we tell you to.", "label": []}
{"id": 8229, "text": "Sometimes it will be to your advantage to simplify things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8230, "text": "Sometimes we'll say simplify.", "label": []}
{"id": 8231, "text": "It takes a good deal of experience to know when it's really worth it to simplify expressions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8232, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8233, "text": "The question is what is this derivative?", "label": []}
{"id": 8234, "text": "And here's an answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 8235, "text": "That's the end of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8236, "text": "This is a more customary form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8237, "text": "But this is answer is okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 8238, "text": "Same issue.", "label": []}
{"id": 8239, "text": "That's exactly the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8240, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8241, "text": "Do you have to show the work?", "label": []}
{"id": 8242, "text": "Well if I ask you what is <EXPRESSION>, then if you wrote down this answer or you wrote down this answer showing no work, that would be acceptable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8243, "text": "If the question was derive the formula for this from the formula for the derivative of the cosine or something like that, then it would not be acceptable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8244, "text": "You'd have to carry out this arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 8245, "text": "So, in other words, typically this will come up, for instance, in various contexts.", "label": []}
{"id": 8246, "text": "You just basically have to follow directions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8247, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8248, "text": "The short answer to that is yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8249, "text": "But I will be getting to that when I discuss the rest of the material here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8250, "text": "We're almost there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8251, "text": "Okay, so let me just finish these examples with <EXPRESSION> last <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8253, "text": "So the last example that I'd like to write down is the <EXPRESSION> that I promised you in the <EXPRESSION> lecture, namely to differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8254, "text": "Basically you're supposed to be able to differentiate any function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8255, "text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> that we mentioned at the beginning.", "label": []}
{"id": 8256, "text": "So here it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8257, "text": "Let's do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8258, "text": "So what is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8259, "text": "Well, it's just = - I have to differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8260, "text": "I have to use the chain rule - it's = the exponential times the derivative of this expression here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8261, "text": "That's the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8262, "text": "That's the <EXPRESSION> step.", "label": []}
{"id": 8263, "text": "And now I have to apply the product rule here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8264, "text": "So I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8265, "text": "And I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> factor, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8266, "text": "Add to it what happens when I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> factor, leaving alone the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8267, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8268, "text": "And that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8269, "text": "That's the end of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8270, "text": "It wasn't that hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 8271, "text": "Of course, it requires you to remember all of the rules, and a lot of formulas underlying them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8272, "text": "So that's consistent with what I just told you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8273, "text": "I told you that you wanted to know this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8274, "text": "I told you that you needed to know this product rule, and that you needed to know the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8275, "text": "And I guess there was <EXPRESSION> more thing, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> came into play there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8276, "text": "So of these formulas, we used <EXPRESSION> of them in this <EXPRESSION> calculation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8277, "text": "Okay, so now what other things did we talk about in Unit <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8278, "text": "So the main other thing that we talked about was the definition of a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8279, "text": "And also there was sort of a goal which was to get to the meaning of the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8280, "text": "So these are things - so we had a couple of ways of looking at it, or at least a couple that I'm going to emphasize right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8281, "text": "But <EXPRESSION>, let me remind you what the formula is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8282, "text": "The derivative is the limit as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8283, "text": "So that's it, and this is certainly going to be a central focus here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8284, "text": "And you want to be able to recognize this formula in a number of ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 8285, "text": "So, how do we use this?", "label": []}
{"id": 8286, "text": "Well <EXPRESSION> thing we did was we calculated a bunch of these rates of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 8287, "text": "In fact, more or less, they're the ones which are written right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8288, "text": "This list of functions here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8289, "text": "Now, which ones did we start out with just straight from the definition here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8290, "text": "Which of these things?", "label": []}
{"id": 8291, "text": "There were a whole bunch of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8292, "text": "So we started out with a function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8293, "text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8294, "text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8295, "text": "We did <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8296, "text": "Now there was a little bit of subtlety with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8297, "text": "We got them using something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8298, "text": "We didn't quite get them all the way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8299, "text": "We got them using the case <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8300, "text": "We got them from the derivative at <EXPRESSION>, we got the formulas for the derivatives of sine and cosine.", "label": []}
{"id": 8301, "text": "But that was an argument which involved plugging in <EXPRESSION>, and running through.", "label": []}
{"id": 8302, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8303, "text": "We also did <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8304, "text": "And that may be it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8305, "text": "Oh yeah, I think that's about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8306, "text": "That may be about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8307, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 8308, "text": "It isn't.", "label": []}
{"id": 8309, "text": "Okay, so let me make a connection here which you probably haven't yet made, which is that we did it for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8310, "text": "And we also did it for <EXPRESSION>'.", "label": []}
{"id": 8311, "text": "So sorry, I shouldn't write primes, because that's not consistent with the claim there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8312, "text": "I differentiated the product; I differentiated the quotient using the same <EXPRESSION> notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8313, "text": "I guess I forgot that because I wasn't there when it happened.", "label": []}
{"id": 8314, "text": "So look, these are the ones that you do by this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8315, "text": "And, of course, you might have to reduce them to other things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8316, "text": "These involve using something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8317, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> involves using the slope of this function at <EXPRESSION>, just the way the sine and the cosine did.", "label": []}
{"id": 8318, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> involves the slopes of the individual functions, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8319, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> also involves the individual So, in other words, it doesn't get you all the way through to the end, but it's expressed in terms of something simpler in each of these cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 8320, "text": "And I could go on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8321, "text": "We didn't do these in class, but you're certainly <EXPRESSION> is a perfectly okay <EXPRESSION> on <EXPRESSION> of the exams.", "label": []}
{"id": 8322, "text": "We ask you for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8323, "text": "In other words, I'm not claiming that it's going to be <EXPRESSION> on this list, but it certainly can be any <EXPRESSION> of these.", "label": []}
{"id": 8324, "text": "But we're not going to ask you to go all the way through to the beginning in these formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8325, "text": "There are also some fundamental limits that I certainly want you to know about.", "label": []}
{"id": 8326, "text": "And these you can derive in reverse.", "label": []}
{"id": 8327, "text": "So I will describe that now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8328, "text": "So let me also emphasize the following thing: I want to read this backwards now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8329, "text": "This is the theme from the very beginning of this lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8330, "text": "Namely, if you're given the function <EXPRESSION>, you can figure out its derivative by this formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8331, "text": "That is the formula for this in terms of what's on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 8332, "text": "On the other hand, you can also use the formula in that direction, and if you know the slope of something, you can figure out what the limit is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8334, "text": "Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION> so it's clearer to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8335, "text": "Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8336, "text": "Suppose you look at this limit here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8337, "text": "Well, I claim that you should recognize that is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the function <EQUATION>, which of course we know to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8338, "text": "So this is reading this formula in reverse.", "label": []}
{"id": 8339, "text": "It's recognizing that <EXPRESSION> of these limits - let me rewrite this again here - <EXPRESSION> of these so-called difference quotient limits is a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8340, "text": "And since we know a formula for that derivative, we can evaluate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8341, "text": "And lastly, there's <EXPRESSION> other type of thing which I think you should know.", "label": []}
{"id": 8342, "text": "These are the ones you do with difference quotients.", "label": []}
{"id": 8343, "text": "There are also other formulas that you want to be able to derive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8344, "text": "You want to be able to derive formulas by implicit differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8345, "text": "In other words, the basic idea is to take whatever equation you've got and simplify it as much as possible, without insisting that you solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8346, "text": "That's not necessarily the most appropriate way to get the rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 8347, "text": "The much simpler formula is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8348, "text": "And that <EXPRESSION> is easier to differentiate implicitly.", "label": []}
{"id": 8349, "text": "So I should say, do this kind of thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8350, "text": "So that's, if you like, a typical derivation that you might see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8351, "text": "And then there's <EXPRESSION> last type of problem that you'll face, and it's the other thing that I claim we discussed.", "label": []}
{"id": 8352, "text": "And it goes all the way back to the <EXPRESSION> lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8353, "text": "So the last thing that we'll be talking about is tangent lines.", "label": []}
{"id": 8354, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8355, "text": "The geometric point of view of a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8356, "text": "And we'll be doing more of this in next the unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8357, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> of all, you'll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8358, "text": "That's often fairly straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 8359, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing is to graph <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8360, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> thing, which I'm going to throw in here, because I regard it in a sort of geometric vein, although it's got an analytical aspect to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8361, "text": "So this is a picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8362, "text": "This is a computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8363, "text": "And if you combine the <EXPRESSION> together, you get something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8364, "text": "And so this is to recognize differentiable functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8365, "text": "Alright, so how do you do this?", "label": []}
{"id": 8366, "text": "Well, we really only have <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8367, "text": "We're going to check the left and right tangents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8368, "text": "They must be =.", "label": []}
{"id": 8369, "text": "So again, this is a property that you should be familiar with from some of your exercises.", "label": []}
{"id": 8370, "text": "And the idea is simply, that if the tangent line exists, it's the same from the right and from the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 8371, "text": "Okay, now I'm going to just do <EXPRESSION> example here from this sort of qualitative sketching skill to give you an example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8372, "text": "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a graph of a function like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8373, "text": "And what I want to do underneath is draw the graph of the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8374, "text": "So this is the function <EQUATION>, and here I'm going to draw the graph of the function <EQUATION> right underneath it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8375, "text": "So now, let's think about what it's supposed to look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8376, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> step that you need to make in order to do this, is to draw a few tangent lines.", "label": []}
{"id": 8377, "text": "I'm just going to draw <EXPRESSION> down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8378, "text": "And I'm going to draw <EXPRESSION> up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8379, "text": "Now, the tangent lines here - notice that the slope of these tangent lines are all positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8380, "text": "So everything I draw down here is going to be above the <EXPRESSION>-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8381, "text": "Furthermore, as I go further to the left, they get steeper and steeper.", "label": []}
{"id": 8382, "text": "So they're getting higher and higher.", "label": []}
{"id": 8383, "text": "So the function is coming down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8384, "text": "It starts up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8385, "text": "Maybe I'll draw it in green to illustrate the graph here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8386, "text": "So that's this function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8387, "text": "As we get farther out, it's getting flatter and flatter.", "label": []}
{"id": 8388, "text": "So it's leveling off, but above the axis like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8389, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> of the things to emphasize is, you should not expect the derivative to look like the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8390, "text": "It's totally different.", "label": []}
{"id": 8391, "text": "It's keeping track at each point of its tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8392, "text": "On the other hand, you should get some kind of physical feel for it, and we'll be practicing this more in the next unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8393, "text": "So let me give you an example of a function which does exactly this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8394, "text": "And it's the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8395, "text": "If you differentiate it, you get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8396, "text": "And this plot above is, roughly speaking, the logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 8397, "text": "And this plot underneath is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8398, "text": "We still have time for <EXPRESSION> question.", "label": []}
{"id": 8399, "text": "And so, fire away.", "label": []}
{"id": 8400, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8401, "text": "So that's in a lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8402, "text": "I'm happy to do it right now, but it's going to take me a whole <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8403, "text": "So, here's how you do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8404, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8405, "text": "And now this is hopeless to differentiate, so I rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8406, "text": "And now I have to differentiate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8407, "text": "So when I differentiate it, I get the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8408, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8409, "text": "So this is a hard step.", "label": []}
{"id": 8410, "text": "That's the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8411, "text": "And on the left side I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8412, "text": "So I'm doing this super fast because we have <EXPRESSION> seconds left.", "label": []}
{"id": 8413, "text": "But this is the hard step right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8414, "text": "And it needs for you to know that <EQUATION> over Oh, bad bad bad, secant squared.", "label": []}
{"id": 8415, "text": "I was ahead of myself so fast.", "label": []}
{"id": 8416, "text": "So here's the identity.", "label": []}
{"id": 8417, "text": "So you need have known this in advance.", "label": []}
{"id": 8418, "text": "And that's the input into this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8419, "text": "So now, what we have is that <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8420, "text": "Now, the last bit of the problem is to rewrite this in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8421, "text": "And that you have to do with a right triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8422, "text": "If this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>, then the angle is <EXPRESSION>, because the tangent of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8423, "text": "So this expresses the fact that the tangent of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8424, "text": "And then the hypotenuse is the square root of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8425, "text": "And so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> divided by that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8426, "text": "So this thing is <EXPRESSION> divided by the <EXPRESSION>, the quantity squared.", "label": []}
{"id": 8427, "text": "So, and then the last little bit here, since I'm racing along, is that it's <EXPRESSION>, which I incorrectly wrote over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8428, "text": "Okay, so good luck on the test.", "label": []}
{"id": 8429, "text": "See you tomorrow.", "label": []}
{"id": 8430, "text": "So, so far, we've seen things about vectors, equation of planes, motions in space, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8431, "text": "Basically we've done geometry in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 8432, "text": "But, calculus, really, is about studying functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8433, "text": "Now, we're going to actually move on to studying functions of several variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8434, "text": "So, this new unit, what we'll do over the next <EXPRESSION> weeks or so will be about functions of several variables and their derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8435, "text": "OK, so <EXPRESSION> of all, we should try to figure out how we are going to think about functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8436, "text": "So, remember, if you have a function of <EXPRESSION> variable, that means you have a quantity that depends on <EXPRESSION> parameter.", "label": []}
{"id": 8437, "text": "Maybe <EXPRESSION> depends on the variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8438, "text": "And, for example, a function that you all know is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8439, "text": "And, the way we would represent that is maybe just by plotting the graph of the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8440, "text": "So, the graph of a function, we plot <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8441, "text": "And, the graph of a <EXPRESSION> function that looks like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8442, "text": "OK, so now, let's say that we had, actually, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8443, "text": "So, that means that the value of <EXPRESSION> depends actually on <EXPRESSION> different parameters, say, if the variables are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, or they can have any names you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 8444, "text": "So, given values of the <EXPRESSION> parameters, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the function will give us a number that we'll call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8445, "text": "That depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> according to some formula, OK, not very surprising so far.", "label": []}
{"id": 8446, "text": "So, for example, I can give you the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8447, "text": "And, of course, as with functions of <EXPRESSION> variable, we don't need things to be defined everywhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 8448, "text": "Sometimes there is the domain of definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 8449, "text": "So, this <EXPRESSION> is defined all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8450, "text": "But, if I tell you, say, <EQUATION>, well, this is only defined if <EXPRESSION> is nonnegative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8451, "text": "If I tell you <EQUATION>, that's only defined if <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8452, "text": "Now, so these are mathematical examples given by explicit formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8453, "text": "And, of course, there's physical examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 8454, "text": "For example, so examples coming from real life, so for example, you can look at the temperature at the certain point on the surface of the earth.", "label": []}
{"id": 8455, "text": "So, you use maybe longitude and latitude; that's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8456, "text": "And then you have <EXPRESSION> = the temperature at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8457, "text": "In fact, because temperature depends also may be on how high up you are.", "label": []}
{"id": 8458, "text": "It depends on elevation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8459, "text": "So, it's actually a function of maybe <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8460, "text": "And, it also depends on time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8461, "text": "So, in fact, maybe it's a function of <EXPRESSION> in <EXPRESSION> coordinates in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 8462, "text": "So, you see that real-world functions can depends on a lot of variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8463, "text": "So, our goal will be to understand how to deal with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8464, "text": "OK, so now you will see very soon, but actually it's already tricky enough to picture a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8465, "text": "So, we are going to focus on the case of functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8466, "text": "And then, we'll see that if we have more than <EXPRESSION> variables, then it's harder to plot the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8467, "text": "We cannot draw with the graph looks like anymore.", "label": []}
{"id": 8468, "text": "But, the tools are the same, the notion of partial derivatives, grade and vector, and so on, all the tools that we will develop work exactly the same way no matter how many variables you have.", "label": []}
{"id": 8469, "text": "So, I'll say, for simplicity we'll focus mostly on <EXPRESSION> or sometimes <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8470, "text": "But, it works the same in any number of variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8471, "text": "OK, so the <EXPRESSION> question is how to visualize a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8472, "text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> thing we can do is try to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8473, "text": "So, maybe I should say <EXPRESSION> which is a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8474, "text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> answer will be, we can try to look at it's graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8475, "text": "And, the idea is the same as with <EXPRESSION> variable, namely, we look at all the possible values of the parameters, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and for each of them, we plot a point whose height is the value of a function at these parameters.", "label": []}
{"id": 8476, "text": "So, we'll plot, let's say, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8477, "text": "And, now that will become, actually, a surface in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 8479, "text": "And, <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8480, "text": "OK, and if we take all of these points together, they will give us some surface that sits in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 8481, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8482, "text": "Oh, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, shorthand.", "label": []}
{"id": 8483, "text": "Well, let's say how to visualize a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8484, "text": "OK, so, how do we do that concretely?", "label": []}
{"id": 8485, "text": "Say that I give you a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8486, "text": "How do we try to represent it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8487, "text": "So, let's do our <EXPRESSION> example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8488, "text": "Let's say I give you a function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8489, "text": "OK, so it looks a little bit silly because it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8490, "text": "But, that's not the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8491, "text": "It's still a valid function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8492, "text": "It just happens to be constant with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8493, "text": "So, to draw the graph we look at the surface in space defined by <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8494, "text": "What kind of surface is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8495, "text": "It's a plane, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 8496, "text": "And, if we want to draw it, <EQUATION> will look, well, let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8497, "text": "Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8498, "text": "Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8499, "text": "If I look at what happens in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane in the plane of a blackboard, it will just look like a line that goes downward with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8500, "text": "OK, so it will be this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8501, "text": "And, what happens if I change <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8502, "text": "Well, if I change <EXPRESSION>, nothing happens because <EXPRESSION> doesn't appear in this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8503, "text": "So, in fact, if instead of setting <EQUATION> I set <EQUATION>, I'm in front of the blackboard, or <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> at the back.", "label": []}
{"id": 8504, "text": "Well, it still looks exactly the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 8505, "text": "So, I have this plane that actually contains the <EXPRESSION> axis and slopes downwards with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8506, "text": "It's kind of hard to draw.", "label": []}
{"id": 8507, "text": "Now, you see immediately what the big problem with graphs will be.", "label": []}
{"id": 8508, "text": "But, these pictures are hard to read.", "label": []}
{"id": 8509, "text": "But that's our <EXPRESSION> graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8510, "text": "OK, a question so far?", "label": []}
{"id": 8511, "text": "OK, so let's say that we have a slightly more complicated function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8512, "text": "How do we see it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8513, "text": "So, let's draw another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8514, "text": "Let's say I give you <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8515, "text": "So, we should try to picture what the surface <EQUATION> looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8516, "text": "So, how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8517, "text": "Well, maybe you are very fast and figured out what it looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8518, "text": "But, if not, then we need to work piece by piece.", "label": []}
{"id": 8519, "text": "So, maybe it will help if we understand <EXPRESSION> what it does in the plane of the blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 8520, "text": "So, if we look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, that means we set <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8521, "text": "And then, <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8522, "text": "What is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8523, "text": "It's a parabola pointing downwards, and starting at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8524, "text": "So, we should draw maybe this downward parabola.", "label": []}
{"id": 8525, "text": "It starts at <EXPRESSION> and it cuts the <EXPRESSION> axis at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8526, "text": "When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, that gives us <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8527, "text": "So, we might have an idea of what it might look like, or maybe not.", "label": []}
{"id": 8528, "text": "Let's get more slices.", "label": []}
{"id": 8529, "text": "Let's see what it does in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, this other vertical plane that's coming towards us.", "label": []}
{"id": 8530, "text": "So, in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, if we set <EQUATION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8531, "text": "It's, again, a parabola going downwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 8532, "text": "OK, so I'm going to try to draw a parabola that goes downward, but now to the front and to the back.", "label": []}
{"id": 8533, "text": "So, we are starting to have a slightly better idea but we still don't know whether the cross section of this thing might be round, square, something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8534, "text": "So, it wants more confirmation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8535, "text": "We might want to also figure out where the surface intersects the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 8536, "text": "So, we hit the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane when <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8537, "text": "That means <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>, that becomes <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8538, "text": "That is a circle of radius <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8539, "text": "That's the unit size.", "label": []}
{"id": 8540, "text": "So, that means that here, we actually have the unit circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8541, "text": "And now, you should imagine that you have this thing that when you slice it by a vertical plane, looks like a downwards parabola.", "label": []}
{"id": 8542, "text": "And, it's actually a surface of revolution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8543, "text": "You can rotate it around the <EXPRESSION> axis, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 8544, "text": "Now, if you stare long enough at that equation, you'll actually see that, yes, we know that it had to be like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8545, "text": "But, see, so these are useful ways of trying to guess what the graph looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8546, "text": "Of course, the other way is to just ask your computer to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8547, "text": "And then, you know, you will get that kind of formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8548, "text": "OK, well, I can leave it on if you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 8549, "text": "No, because I plotted a different function that I will show you later.", "label": []}
{"id": 8550, "text": "So, it goes this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8551, "text": "I mean, if you want, it's really going downward.", "label": []}
{"id": 8552, "text": "Yes, I agree that the sheet is upside down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8553, "text": "That's because I plotted something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8554, "text": "OK, so, in fact, so I plotted in my computer was actually <EXPRESSION> that looks like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8555, "text": "See, it's the same with a parabola going upwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 8556, "text": "If you want to see more examples, I have various examples to show, well, here's the graph, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8557, "text": "See, so that <EXPRESSION> is kind of interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 8558, "text": "It looks like a saddle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8559, "text": "If you look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then it's a parabola going up, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8560, "text": "And, that's what we see to the left and to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8561, "text": "But, if you put it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then that's a parabola going downwards, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8562, "text": "So, we have a parabola going downwards in <EXPRESSION> direction, upwards in the other <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8563, "text": "And together, they form this surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 8564, "text": "And of course, you can plot much more complicated functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8565, "text": "So, this <EXPRESSION>, well, if you can read very small things, you can see the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8566, "text": "It doesn't matter, just to show you that you can put a formula into a computer: it will show you a picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8567, "text": "OK, so that's pretty good.", "label": []}
{"id": 8568, "text": "I mean, you can see that it can get a bit cluttered because maybe those features that are hidden behind, or maybe we have trouble seeing if we don't have a computer, that looks very readable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8569, "text": "But, this is kind of hard to visualize sometimes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8570, "text": "So, there is another way to plot the functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8571, "text": "And, let's call it the contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 8572, "text": "So, the contour plot is a very elegant solution to the problem that it's difficult to draw to space pictures on a sheet of paper or on a blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 8573, "text": "So, instead, let's try to represent the function of <EXPRESSION> variables by just the map, you know, the same way that when you walk around, you have actually geographical maps that fit on a piece of paper that tell you about what the real world looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8574, "text": "So, what contour plot looks something like this?", "label": []}
{"id": 8575, "text": "So, it's an <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 8576, "text": "And, that, you have a bunch of curves.", "label": []}
{"id": 8577, "text": "And, what the curves represent are the elevations on the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8578, "text": "So, for example, this curve might correspond to all the points where <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8579, "text": "And, that curve might be all the points where <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> and so on, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 8580, "text": "So, when you see you this kind of plot, you're supposed to think that the graph of the function sits somewhere in space above that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8581, "text": "It's like a map telling you how high things are.", "label": []}
{"id": 8582, "text": "And, what you would want to do with the function, really, is be able to tell quickly what's the value at a given point?", "label": []}
{"id": 8583, "text": "Well, let's say I want to look at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8584, "text": "I know that <EXPRESSION>  is somewhere between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8585, "text": "Actually, it's much faster to read than the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8586, "text": "On the graph I might have to look carefully, and then measure things, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8587, "text": "Here, I can just raise the value of <EXPRESSION> by comparing with the nearby lines.", "label": []}
{"id": 8588, "text": "OK, so let me try to make that more precise.", "label": []}
{"id": 8589, "text": "So, it shows all the points where <EXPRESSION> = some fixed values, some fixed constants.", "label": []}
{"id": 8590, "text": "And, these constants typically are chosen at regular intervals.", "label": []}
{"id": 8591, "text": "For example, here I chose <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and they could continue with <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8592, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> way to think about it, how does this relate to the graph?", "label": []}
{"id": 8593, "text": "Well, that's the same thing as cutting, I mean, we slice the graph by horizontal planes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8594, "text": "So, horizontal planes have equations of a form <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION> <EQUATION>, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8595, "text": "So, maybe the graph of my function will be some sort of plot out there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8596, "text": "And, if I slice it by the plane <EQUATION>, then I will get the level curve, which is the point where <EQUATION>, and so, that's called a level curve of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8597, "text": "OK, and so we repeat the process with maybe <EQUATION>, and we get another level curve, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8598, "text": "And, then we squish all of them up, and that's how we get the contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 8599, "text": "OK, so each of these lines, imagine that this is like some mountain or something that you are hiking on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8600, "text": "Each of these lines tells you how you could move to stay at a constant height if you want to get to the other side of the mountain but without ever going up or down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8601, "text": "You would just walk along that path, and it will get you there without effort.", "label": []}
{"id": 8602, "text": "So, in fact, if you have been talking about hiking on mountains, well, that's exactly what a topographical map is about.", "label": []}
{"id": 8603, "text": "So, I need to zoom a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8604, "text": "So, a topographic map, this <EXPRESSION> from the US geological survey shows you, basically, all the level curves of an altitude function on a piece of land.", "label": []}
{"id": 8605, "text": "So, you know that if you walk right along these curves, you will stay along the same height.", "label": []}
{"id": 8606, "text": "And you know that if you walk towards, these don't have numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8607, "text": "Let me find a place with numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8608, "text": "Here, there is a <EXPRESSION> in the middle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8613, "text": "Of course, we don't have a formula for that function, but we have a contour plot, and that's what we need actually to understand what's going on there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8614, "text": "OK, any questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 8615, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 8616, "text": "OK, so another example of contour plots, well, you've probably seen various versions of these temperature maps.", "label": []}
{"id": 8617, "text": "So, that's supposed to be how warm it is right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8619, "text": "Instead of having curves, it has all these colors.", "label": []}
{"id": 8620, "text": "But, the effect is the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 8621, "text": "If you look at the separations between consecutive colors, these are the level curves of a function that tells you the temperature at a given point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8622, "text": "OK, so these are examples of contour plots in real life.", "label": []}
{"id": 8623, "text": "OK, no questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 8624, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 8626, "text": "Well, let's do a couple of examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 8627, "text": "So, let's start with <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8629, "text": "So, let's try to plot it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8631, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8632, "text": "So, that's the <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8633, "text": "OK, so that's the level, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8634, "text": "Where's the level <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8635, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when negative <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8636, "text": "That means when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8637, "text": "So, you go to minus <EXPRESSION>, and that will be where my level <EXPRESSION> is, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8638, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8639, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is negative <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8640, "text": "Is that convincing?", "label": []}
{"id": 8641, "text": "Do you see how we got that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8642, "text": "OK, let me do it again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8643, "text": "I don't see anybody nodding, so that's kind of bad news.", "label": []}
{"id": 8644, "text": "So, if I want to know, where is the level curve, say, <EXPRESSION>, I try to set <EQUATION>", "label": []}
{"id": 8646, "text": "<EQUATION> means that negative <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> means that <EQUATION>, and <EXPRESSION> = minus <EXPRESSION> is this horizontal line on this chart.", "label": []}
{"id": 8647, "text": "OK, and same with the others.", "label": []}
{"id": 8648, "text": "So, you can see on the map that the value of a function doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8649, "text": "If you move parallel to the <EXPRESSION> axis, nothing happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 8650, "text": "If you move in the <EXPRESSION> direction, it decreases at a constant rate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8651, "text": "That's why the contours are evenly spaced.", "label": []}
{"id": 8652, "text": "How spaced out they are tells you, actually, how steep things are.", "label": []}
{"id": 8653, "text": "So, that corresponds exactly to that picture, except that here we draw <EXPRESSION> coming to the front, and <EXPRESSION> to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8654, "text": "It's an unfortunate consequence of the usual way of plotting things in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 8655, "text": "OK, so these horizontal lines here correspond actually to horizontal lines here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8656, "text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8657, "text": "Let's do <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8658, "text": "OK, or maybe I will write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8659, "text": "It's really the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8660, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, let's see, where is this function = <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8661, "text": "Well, we said <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> in the unit circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8662, "text": "OK, so, the <EXPRESSION> level, well, let's say that this is my unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8663, "text": "That's where it's at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8664, "text": "What about <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8665, "text": "Well, that's when <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8666, "text": "Well, that's only going to be here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8667, "text": "So, that's just a single point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8668, "text": "What about <EQUATION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8669, "text": "That's when <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8670, "text": "That's a circle of radius square root of <EXPRESSION>, which is about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8671, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8672, "text": "So, it's somewhere here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8673, "text": "Then, minus <EXPRESSION>, similarly, will be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8674, "text": "Square root of <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8675, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8676, "text": "And then, minus <EXPRESSION> will be of radius <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8677, "text": "So, what I want to show here is that they are getting closer and closer apart, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 8679, "text": "Things don't change if I rotate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8682, "text": "OK, so, this top here is kind of flat.", "label": []}
{"id": 8683, "text": "And then it gets steeper and steeper.", "label": []}
{"id": 8684, "text": "And, that's what we observe on that picture there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8686, "text": "Maybe actually I'll make it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8687, "text": "OK, so it looks exactly the same as this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8688, "text": "But, the difference is if you can see the numbers which are not there, so you can see them, then you would know that instead of decreasing as we move out, this <EXPRESSION> is increasing as we go out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8689, "text": "OK, so that's where we use, actually, the labels on the level curves that tell us whether things are going up or down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8690, "text": "But, the contour plots look exactly the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 8692, "text": "So, the contour plot, well, let me actually zoom out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8693, "text": "So, the contour plot looks like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8695, "text": "And, if you look on the plot, say that you started at the saddle point in the middle and you try to stay at the same level.", "label": []}
{"id": 8696, "text": "So, it looks like a mountain pass, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8698, "text": "And actually, on the map, they look exactly like this, too, these crossing lines.", "label": []}
{"id": 8699, "text": "OK, so, these are things that go on the side of the <EXPRESSION> mountains that are to the left and right, and stay at the same height as the mountain pass.", "label": []}
{"id": 8700, "text": "On the other hand, if you go along the <EXPRESSION> direction, to the left or to the right, then you go towards positive values.", "label": []}
{"id": 8702, "text": "OK, the equation for, the function was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8703, "text": "So, you can try to plot them by hand and confirmed that it does look like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8704, "text": "But, I trust my computer.", "label": []}
{"id": 8705, "text": "And, finally, this <EXPRESSION>, well, so the contour plot looks a bit complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8706, "text": "But, you can see <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8709, "text": "And then, at some point in the middle, we have a mountain pass.", "label": []}
{"id": 8710, "text": "And there, we see the <EXPRESSION> crossing lines again, like, on the plot of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8711, "text": "And so, at this saddle point here, if we go north or south, then we go down on either side to the Valley.", "label": []}
{"id": 8712, "text": "And, if we go east or west, then we go towards the mountains.", "label": []}
{"id": 8713, "text": "We'll go up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8714, "text": "OK, does that make sense a little bit?", "label": []}
{"id": 8715, "text": "OK, so, reading plots is not easy, but hopefully we'll get used to it very soon.", "label": []}
{"id": 8716, "text": "OK, so actually let's say, well, OK, so, I want to point out <EXPRESSION> thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8719, "text": "And then, I can ask myself, is the value of the function increase or decrease in each of these situations?", "label": []}
{"id": 8720, "text": "Well, that's the kind of thing that the contour plot can tell me very quickly.", "label": []}
{"id": 8721, "text": "So OK, so say, for example, that I have a piece of contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 8722, "text": "That looks, you know, like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8723, "text": "Maybe this is <EQUATION>, and this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8724, "text": "And here, this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8725, "text": "And, let's say that I start at the point, say, at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8726, "text": "OK, so here I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8732, "text": "And, similarly, I can tell that if <EXPRESSION> increases, then <EXPRESSION>, well, it looks like if I increase <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> will also increase.", "label": []}
{"id": 8733, "text": "And, if <EXPRESSION> decreases, then <EXPRESSION> decreases.", "label": []}
{"id": 8734, "text": "And, that's the kind of qualitative analysis that we can do easily from the contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 8735, "text": "But, maybe we'd like to actually be more precise in that, and tell how fast <EXPRESSION> changes if I change <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8736, "text": "OK, so to find the rate of change, that's exactly where we use derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8737, "text": "So So, we are going to have to deal with partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8738, "text": "So, I will explain to you soon why partial.", "label": []}
{"id": 8740, "text": "And, it's defined as a limit when delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the change in <EXPRESSION>", "label": []}
{"id": 8741, "text": "Sorry, it's not going to fit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8742, "text": "I have to go to the next line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8743, "text": "It's going to be the limit as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 8744, "text": "So, the change in <EXPRESSION> between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8745, "text": "Sometimes you write delta <EXPRESSION> for the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8746, "text": "And then, you take the limit of this rate of increase as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8747, "text": "Now, of course, if you have a formula for <EXPRESSION>, then you know, at least you should know, I suspect most of you know how to actually take the derivative of a function from its formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8748, "text": "So Now, how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8749, "text": "Sorry, and I should also tell you what this means on the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8750, "text": "So, if I plot the graph of a function, and to have my point, <EXPRESSION>, and here I have <EXPRESSION>, how do I see the derivative?", "label": []}
{"id": 8751, "text": "Well, I look at the tangent line to the graph, and the slope of the tangent line is <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 8752, "text": "And, not every function has a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8753, "text": "You have functions that are not regular enough to actually have a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8754, "text": "So, in this class, we are not going to actually worry too much about differentiability.", "label": []}
{"id": 8755, "text": "But, it's good, at least, to be aware that you can't always take the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8756, "text": "So, yes, and what else do I want to remind you of?", "label": []}
{"id": 8758, "text": "Is this kind of familiar to you?", "label": []}
{"id": 8759, "text": "Yeah, I mean, maybe with different notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 8760, "text": "Maybe you called that delta <EXPRESSION> or something.", "label": []}
{"id": 8761, "text": "Maybe you called that <EXPRESSION> or something.", "label": []}
{"id": 8762, "text": "But, it's the usual approximation formula using the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8763, "text": "If you put more terms, then you get the dreaded Taylor approximation that I know you guys don't like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8764, "text": "So, the question is how do we do the same for a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8765, "text": "So, the difficulty there is we can change <EXPRESSION>, or we can change <EXPRESSION>, or we can change both.", "label": []}
{"id": 8766, "text": "And, presumably, the manner in which <EXPRESSION> changes will be different depending on whether we change <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8767, "text": "So, that's why we have several different notions of derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8768, "text": "So, OK, we have a notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8771, "text": "And, this symbol is partial.", "label": []}
{"id": 8772, "text": "OK, so it's a special notation for partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8773, "text": "And, essentially what it means is we are going to do a derivative where we care about only <EXPRESSION> variable at a time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8774, "text": "That's why it's partial.", "label": []}
{"id": 8775, "text": "It's missing the other variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8776, "text": "So, a function of several variables doesn't have the usual derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8777, "text": "It has only partial derivatives for each variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8779, "text": "OK, so here I'm actually not changing <EXPRESSION> at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 8780, "text": "I'm just changing <EXPRESSION> and looking at the rate of change with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8781, "text": "And, I have the same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8783, "text": "So, this time I keep <EXPRESSION> the same, but I change <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8784, "text": "OK, so that's the definition of a partial derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8785, "text": "And, we say that a function is differentiable if these things exist.", "label": []}
{"id": 8786, "text": "OK, so most of the functions we'll see are differentiable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8787, "text": "And, we'll actually learn how to compute their partial derivatives without having to do this because we'll just have the usual methods for computing derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8788, "text": "So, in fact, I claim you already know how to take partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8789, "text": "So, let's see what it means geometrically.", "label": []}
{"id": 8790, "text": "So, geometrically, my function can be represented by this graph, and I fix some point, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8791, "text": "And then, I'm going to ask myself what happens if I change the value of, well, <EXPRESSION>, keeping <EXPRESSION> constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8792, "text": "So, if I keep <EXPRESSION> constant and change <EXPRESSION>, it means that I'm moving forwards or backwards parallel to the <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8793, "text": "So, that determines for me the vertical plane parallel to the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane when I fix <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8796, "text": "That means it's the rate of change if I move along this curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 8797, "text": "So, in fact, if I look at the slope of this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8798, "text": "So, if I draw the tangent line to this slice, then the slope will be partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8799, "text": "I think I have a better picture of that somewhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 8800, "text": "Yes, here it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8801, "text": "OK, that's the same picture, just with different colors.", "label": []}
{"id": 8802, "text": "So, I take the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8803, "text": "I slice it by a vertical plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 8804, "text": "I get the curve, and now I take the slope of that curve, and that gives me the partial derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8806, "text": "OK, so I fix <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8807, "text": "That means that I slice by a plane that's parallel to the blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 8808, "text": "I get a curve, and I looked at the slope of that curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 8809, "text": "OK, so it's just a matter of formatting <EXPRESSION> variable, setting it constant, and looking at the other <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8810, "text": "So, how to compute these things, well, we actually, to find, well, there's a piece of notation I haven't told you yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 8811, "text": "So, another notation you will see, I think this is what <EXPRESSION> uses a lot in physics.", "label": []}
{"id": 8812, "text": "And, this is what <EXPRESSION> uses a lot in applied math, which is the same thing as physics but with different notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 8813, "text": "OK, so it just too different notations: partial <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8814, "text": "And, they are the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8815, "text": "Well, we just treat <EXPRESSION> as a constant, and <EXPRESSION> as a variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8816, "text": "And, vice versa if we want to find partial with aspect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8817, "text": "So, let me just finish with <EXPRESSION> quick example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8818, "text": "Let's say that they give you <EQUATION>, then partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8819, "text": "Well, let's take the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8820, "text": "So, here it's <EXPRESSION> times a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8821, "text": "Derivative of <EQUATION> times the constant plus what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8822, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, because it's a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8823, "text": "If you do, instead, <EXPRESSION>, then this is actually a constant times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8824, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8825, "text": "So, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8826, "text": "And, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8827, "text": "OK, so it's fairly easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 8828, "text": "You just have to keep remembering which <EXPRESSION> is a variable, and which <EXPRESSION> isn't.", "label": []}
{"id": 8829, "text": "OK, so more about this next time, and we will also learn about maxima and minima in several variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 8830, "text": "Let's now attempt to find a solution for the logistic differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8831, "text": "And we already found some constant solutions, we can think through that a little bit just as a little bit of review from the last few videos.", "label": []}
{"id": 8833, "text": "It'll just stay at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8834, "text": "Which is nice because that's what would actually happen in a real population.", "label": []}
{"id": 8835, "text": "That gives us the constant solution that <EQUATION>, that's <EXPRESSION> solution of this differential equation, not that interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 8836, "text": "A <EXPRESSION> population will never grow or change.", "label": []}
{"id": 8837, "text": "The other constant solution is what if our population started at the maximum of what the environment could sustain, and in that situation this term is going to be <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8838, "text": "<EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and so in there, the population would also not change.", "label": []}
{"id": 8839, "text": "It would just stay at <EXPRESSION>, and so the rate of change would just stay at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8840, "text": "So that's another constant solution, that we start at the maximum population and then this differential equation tells us a scenario that never changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8841, "text": "But we said, hey look, there could be something interesting that happens if our initial condition, which we called <EXPRESSION> sub-not, that's our <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8844, "text": "So we can imagine a scenario where we asymptote towards <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8845, "text": "Let's see if we can solve this to find this, this <EXPRESSION> to find the actual analytic expression for this <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8846, "text": "Because this is interesting, this is what could be used to model populations that would be more consistent with a Malthusian mindset.", "label": []}
{"id": 8847, "text": "So let's see if we can do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8848, "text": "To do that we just have to realize this is a separable differential equation, and we're assuming is a function of <EXPRESSION>, we're going to solve for an <EXPRESSION> that satisfies this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8849, "text": "So we just have to separate it from the explicit ts, but there are no explicit ts here, so it's quite easy to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 8850, "text": "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this part right over here, and I'm going to divide both sides by that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8851, "text": "I'm going to leave the r on the right hand side, it'll make things, I think, a little bit easier as we try to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8852, "text": "So let me just do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8853, "text": "So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION> times <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8854, "text": "Another way we could think about it, well actually, let me just continue to tackle it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8855, "text": "So we get that, and now what I want to do is take the anti-derivative of both sides with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8856, "text": "Well, this is pretty straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 8857, "text": "That's just going to be rt times some constant, but what's this going to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 8858, "text": "This is kind of this messy thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8859, "text": "And maybe if we could break this out, if we can expand this into <EXPRESSION> fractions, do a little bit of partial fraction expansion, maybe we can come up with an expression that's a little bit easier to find the anti-derivative of.", "label": []}
{"id": 8860, "text": "I'm hoping that I can find an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION> where <EXPRESSION> = this business.", "label": []}
{"id": 8861, "text": "= <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8862, "text": "Let's see if we can find an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8863, "text": "This is just partial fraction expansion, if this looks unfamiliar to you I encourage you to review that part on Khan Academy.", "label": []}
{"id": 8864, "text": "Do a search for partial fraction expansion on Khan Academy.", "label": []}
{"id": 8865, "text": "So how do we do it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8866, "text": "We'll just add these <EXPRESSION> right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8868, "text": "So it's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8870, "text": "So that's just adding fractions with unlike denominators.", "label": []}
{"id": 8871, "text": "It's going to be = this,<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8872, "text": "Now we can try to think about what is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> going to be =?", "label": []}
{"id": 8873, "text": "What can they be =?", "label": []}
{"id": 8874, "text": "Well I have a constant term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8875, "text": "I don't have any <EXPRESSION> term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8877, "text": "That's pretty nice.", "label": []}
{"id": 8878, "text": "So we can say that <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and that if <EQUATION> we have negative <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8879, "text": "Well what's <EXPRESSION> going to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 8880, "text": "Well <EXPRESSION> would be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8883, "text": "You can rewind the video and review that, if you find it necessary, so let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8884, "text": "So how does this help us?", "label": []}
{"id": 8885, "text": "Well, hey, you probably might be recognizing the anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and you might even see this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8886, "text": "So let's just think through this a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8887, "text": "We know the anti-derivative of <EXPRESSION> is a natural log, just did a new color, is a natural log of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8889, "text": "We could do the same thing over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8890, "text": "Notice, I have an expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 8891, "text": "What would be the derivative of this expression right over here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8892, "text": "It would be negative <EXPRESSION>, if I'm talking the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it would be negative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8893, "text": "I have a positive <EXPRESSION> here, and I could even make it negative.", "label": []}

{"id": 8942, "text": "You could also say that, if this is exact well, <EXPRESSION> let's.", "label": []}
{"id": 8943, "text": "This exact, before we start talking about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 8951, "text": "But we do see that they're both <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8953, "text": "So this is exact.", "label": []}

{"id": 8955, "text": "We'll do it, just so that we get used to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8956, "text": "But if you look here, you actually could have figured out that this is actually a separable equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8957, "text": "But anyway, this is exact.", "label": []}
{"id": 8958, "text": "So knowing that it's exact, it tells us that there's some function <EXPRESSION>, where psi is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8959, "text": "Where <EXPRESSION> = this function, = <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> I shouldn't say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 8967, "text": "This right here, if we can find a <EXPRESSION>, where the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, then this can be rewritten as this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8968, "text": "And how do we know that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8969, "text": "Because the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, using the partial derivative chain rules, is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8970, "text": "This partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8971, "text": "This partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is this, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8972, "text": "So this is the whole point of exact equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 8973, "text": "But anyway, so let's figure out what our <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8974, "text": "Actually, before we figure out, if the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>, then if you integrate both sides, you just the solution of this equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8975, "text": "So using this information, if we can solve for PRESSION>, then we know that the solution of this differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8976, "text": "And then if we have some initial conditions, we could solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8977, "text": "So let's solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8978, "text": "So let's integrate both sides of this equation, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8979, "text": "And then we get <EQUATION>, plus some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8980, "text": "Let's call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8981, "text": "And remember, normally when you take an antiderivative, you have just <EXPRESSION> here, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8982, "text": "But you can kind of say we took an anti-partial derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8983, "text": "So when you took a partial derivative, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, not only do you lose constants that's why we have a plus <EXPRESSION>, normally but you also lose anything that's a function of just <EXPRESSION>, and not <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8984, "text": "So for example, take the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, you're going to get this, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8985, "text": "Because the partial derivative of a function, purely of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8986, "text": "So it will disappear.", "label": []}
{"id": 8987, "text": "So anyway, we take the antiderivative of this, we get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8988, "text": "Now, we use this information.", "label": []}
{"id": 8989, "text": "Well, we use this information.", "label": []}
{"id": 8990, "text": "We take the partial of this expression, and we say, well, the partial of this expression, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, has to = this, and then we can solve for <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>, then we'll be done.", "label": []}
{"id": 8991, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8993, "text": "This part is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8994, "text": "If you take the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>, because these are constants, from a <EXPRESSION> point of view.", "label": []}
{"id": 8995, "text": "So you're left with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8996, "text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION>, which is the partial of psi, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, = this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8997, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8998, "text": "And then if we wanted to figure out what <EXPRESSION> is, we get <EXPRESSION> just integrate both sides, with respect to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8999, "text": "Now, you could have a plus <EXPRESSION> there, but if you watched the previous example, you'll see that that <EXPRESSION> kind of merges with the other <EXPRESSION>, so you don't have to worry about it right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9000, "text": "So what is our <EXPRESSION> function, as we know it now, not worrying about the plus <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9001, "text": "It is <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, plus <EXPRESSION> which we figured out is this plus <EXPRESSION>, minus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9002, "text": "And we know a solution of our original differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9003, "text": "So the solution of our differential equation is this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9004, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9005, "text": "If you had some additional conditions, you could test it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9006, "text": "And I encourage you to test this out on this original equation, or I encourage you to take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and prove to yourself that if you took the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, here, implicitly, that you would get this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9007, "text": "Anyway, let's do another <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9008, "text": "Let's clear image.", "label": []}
{"id": 9009, "text": "So the more examples you see, the better.", "label": []}
{"id": 9010, "text": "So let's see, this <EXPRESSION> says <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9011, "text": "So what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9013, "text": "What's the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, just this part right here?", "label": []}
{"id": 9014, "text": "The partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9015, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9016, "text": "So the partial of this, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, is different than the partial of <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9017, "text": "So this is not exact.", "label": []}
{"id": 9018, "text": "So we can't solve this using our exact methodology.", "label": []}
{"id": 9019, "text": "So that was a fairly straightforward problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9020, "text": "Let's do another <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9021, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 9022, "text": "I'm running out of time, so I want to do <EXPRESSION> that's not too complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9023, "text": "Let's see, <EXPRESSION> actually, let me do this in the next problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9024, "text": "I don't want to rush these things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9025, "text": "I will continue this in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 9026, "text": "See you soon.", "label": []}
{"id": 9027, "text": "This time, we started solving differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9028, "text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> lecture of the term, and I have yet to solve a single differential equation in this class.", "label": []}
{"id": 9029, "text": "Well, that will be rectified from now until the end of the term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9032, "text": "So, what does such an equation look like?", "label": []}
{"id": 9033, "text": "I'll find some function of <EXPRESSION> plus some other function of <EXPRESSION> = yet another function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9034, "text": "Obviously, the <EXPRESSION> doesn't have the same status here that <EXPRESSION> does, so <EXPRESSION> is extremely limited in how it can appear in the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9035, "text": "But, <EXPRESSION> can be pretty much arbitrary in those places.", "label": []}
{"id": 9036, "text": "So, that's the equation we are talking about, and I'll put it up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9037, "text": "This is the <EXPRESSION> version of it, and we'll call them purple.", "label": []}
{"id": 9038, "text": "Now, why is that called the linear equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 9039, "text": "The word linear is a very heavily used word in mathematics, science, and engineering.", "label": []}
{"id": 9041, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is not a variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 9042, "text": "Well, you will learn, in a certain sense, it helps to think of it as <EXPRESSION>, not right now perhaps, but think of it as linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 9043, "text": "The most closely analogous thing would be a linear equation, a real linear equation, the kind you studied in high school, which would look like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9044, "text": "It would have <EXPRESSION> variables, and, I guess, constant coefficients, = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9045, "text": "Now, that's a linear equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9046, "text": "And that's the sense in which this is linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 9047, "text": "It's linear in <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which are the analogs of the variables <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9048, "text": "A little bit of terminology, if <EQUATION>, it's called homogeneous, the same way this equation is called homogeneous, as you know from <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9049, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, if the right hand side is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9050, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> I should write here, but I won't.", "label": []}
{"id": 9051, "text": "That's called homogeneous.", "label": []}
{"id": 9052, "text": "Now, this is a common form for the equation, but it's not what it's called standard form.", "label": []}
{"id": 9053, "text": "The standard form for the equation, and since this is going to be a prime course of confusion, which is probably completely correct, but a prime source of confusion is what I meant.", "label": []}
{"id": 9055, "text": "So, you can always convert that to a standard form by simply dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9056, "text": "And if I do that, the equation will look like <EXPRESSION> plus, now, it's common to not call it <EXPRESSION> anymore, the coefficient, because it's really <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9057, "text": "And, therefore, it's common to adopt, yet, a new letter for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9058, "text": "And, the standard <EXPRESSION> that many people use is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9059, "text": "How about the right hand side?", "label": []}
{"id": 9060, "text": "We needed a letter for that, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 9061, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, but we'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9062, "text": "So, when I talk about the standard linear form for a linear <EXPRESSION> order equation, it's absolutely that that I'm talking about.", "label": []}
{"id": 9063, "text": "Now, you immediately see that there is a potential for confusion here because what did I call the standard form for a <EXPRESSION> order equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 9064, "text": "So, I'm going to say, not this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9065, "text": "The standard <EXPRESSION> order form, what would that be?", "label": []}
{"id": 9066, "text": "Well, it would be <EXPRESSION> =, and everything else on the left hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 9067, "text": "So, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9068, "text": "And now, if I turn this into the standard <EXPRESSION> order form, it would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9069, "text": "But, of course, nobody would write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9070, "text": "So, now, I explicitly want to say that this is a form which I will never use for this equation, although half the books of the world do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9071, "text": "In short, this poor little <EXPRESSION> order equation belongs to <EXPRESSION> ethnic groups.", "label": []}
{"id": 9072, "text": "It's both a <EXPRESSION> order equation, and therefore, its standard form should be written this way, but it's also a linear equation, and therefore its standard form should be used this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9073, "text": "Well, it has to decide, and I have decided for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9074, "text": "It is, above all, a linear equation, not just a <EXPRESSION> order equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9075, "text": "And, in this course, this will always be the standard form.", "label": []}
{"id": 9076, "text": "Now, well, what on earth is the difference?", "label": []}
{"id": 9077, "text": "If you don't do it that way, the difference is entirely in the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9078, "text": "But, if you get the sign of <EXPRESSION> wrong in the answers, it is just a disaster from that point on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9079, "text": "A trivial little change of sign in the answer produces solutions and functions which have totally different behavior.", "label": []}
{"id": 9080, "text": "And, you are going to be really lost in this course.", "label": []}
{"id": 9081, "text": "So, maybe I should draw a line through it to indicate, please don't pay any attention to this whatsoever, except that we are not going to do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9082, "text": "Okay, well, what's so important about this equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 9083, "text": "Well, number <EXPRESSION>, it can always be solved.", "label": []}
{"id": 9084, "text": "That's a very, very big thing in differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9085, "text": "But, it's also the equation which arises in a variety of models.", "label": []}
{"id": 9086, "text": "Now, I'm just going to list a few of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9089, "text": "There's the mixing model, which is hardly less important.", "label": []}

{"id": 9091, "text": "You have that in your problem set.", "label": []}

{"id": 9098, "text": "Now, today I have to pick a model.", "label": []}
{"id": 9100, "text": "So, this is going to be today's model.", "label": []}

{"id": 9106, "text": "But, we can't do everything today.", "label": []}

{"id": 9109, "text": "I'll put conduction over there, and diffusion over here, let's say, since, as you will see, the similarities, they are practically the same model.", "label": []}

{"id": 9146, "text": "Of this let me pick a nice color of this blue thing in the blue box, and then I can express it as a convolution integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 9147, "text": "And how do I do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9148, "text": "I could just do it right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9150, "text": "Let me write that down, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9151, "text": "And now the convolution theorem tells us that this is going to be = the inverse Laplace transform of this <EXPRESSION> term in the product.", "label": []}
{"id": 9152, "text": "They're not too different.", "label": []}
{"id": 9153, "text": "And what I just said confused me a bit, so I don't want to confuse you.", "label": []}
{"id": 9154, "text": "But I think you get the idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 9155, "text": "I have these <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9156, "text": "I recognize these independently.", "label": []}
{"id": 9157, "text": "I can independently take the inverse of each of these things, so the inverse Laplace transform of their products is going to be the convolution of each of their inverse transforms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9158, "text": "Now what's this over here?", "label": []}
{"id": 9159, "text": "Well I had this in the beginning of the problem?", "label": []}
{"id": 9160, "text": "The inverse Laplace transform of this, right here, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9161, "text": "And then we're going to convolute that with the inverse Laplace transform of this right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9162, "text": "Let's do a little bit of work on the side, just to make sure we get this right.", "label": []}
{"id": 9163, "text": "So the Laplace transform of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9166, "text": "So that will be = <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9167, "text": "We essentially shifted it by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9168, "text": "So now we have something that looks very similar to this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9169, "text": "If we just set our <EXPRESSION> to be = <EXPRESSION>, here our <EQUATION>, then it fits this pattern.", "label": []}
{"id": 9170, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9172, "text": "So this is the solution to our differential equation, even though it's not in a pleasant form to look at.", "label": []}
{"id": 9173, "text": "And we can, if we want, express it as an integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 9174, "text": "I'm not going to actually solve the integral in this problem, because it gets hairy, and it's not even clear that well, I won't even attempt to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9175, "text": "But I just want to get into a form, and from there it's just integral calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9176, "text": "or maybe a computer.", "label": []}
{"id": 9177, "text": "What's the convolution of these <EXPRESSION> things?", "label": []}
{"id": 9179, "text": "Well, I could actually switch, and I haven't shown you this, but we can switch the order either way, but actually let me just do it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9180, "text": "I could write this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9181, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION> way, that if I wanted to express the solution of this differential equation's integral, I could write it like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9182, "text": "And it actually should be kind of obvious to you that this could go either way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9183, "text": "Because when it was a product up here, obviously order does not matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 9184, "text": "I could write this term <EXPRESSION>, or I could write that term <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9185, "text": "So regardless of which term is written <EXPRESSION>, the same principle would apply.", "label": []}
{"id": 9186, "text": "And I'll formally prove it in a future video.", "label": []}
{"id": 9187, "text": "So we could have also done it the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9188, "text": "We could have written this expression as <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, convoluted with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9189, "text": "And that would be = the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9190, "text": "So these are equivalent.", "label": []}
{"id": 9191, "text": "Either of these would be an acceptable answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 9192, "text": "And normally on a test like this, the teacher won't expect you to actually evaluate these integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 9193, "text": "The teacher will just say, get it into an integral just to kind of see whether you know how to convolute things and get your solution to the differential equation at least into this form, because from here it really is just, I won't say basic calculus, but it's non-differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9194, "text": "So hopefully, this <EXPRESSION> example with the convolution to solve an inverse transform clarified things up a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9195, "text": "So, we're ready to begin Lecture <EXPRESSION>, and what I'm going to begin with is by finishing up some things from last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9196, "text": "We'll talk about approximations, and I want to fill in a number of comments and get you a little bit more oriented in the point of view that I'm trying to express about approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9197, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all, I want to remind you of the actual applied example that I wrote down last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9198, "text": "So that was this business here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9199, "text": "There was something from special relativity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9200, "text": "And the approximation that we used was the linear approximation, with a <EXPRESSION> power that comes out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9201, "text": "I want to reiterate why this is a useful way of thinking of things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9202, "text": "And why this is that this comes up in real life.", "label": []}
{"id": 9203, "text": "Why this is maybe more important than everything that I've taught you about technically so far.", "label": []}
{"id": 9205, "text": "If you work that out, this is approximately the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9206, "text": "So what is this saying?", "label": []}
{"id": 9207, "text": "This is saying that if you have this satellite, which is going at speed <EXPRESSION>, and little <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light, then the change in the watch down here on earth, relative to the time on the satellite, is going to be proportional to this ratio here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9208, "text": "So, physically, this makes sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9209, "text": "This is time divided by time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9210, "text": "And this is velocity squared divided by velocity squared.", "label": []}
{"id": 9211, "text": "So, in each case, the units divide out.", "label": []}
{"id": 9212, "text": "So this is a dimensionless quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9213, "text": "And this is a dimensionless quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9214, "text": "And the only point here that we're trying to make is just this notion of proportionality.", "label": []}
{"id": 9215, "text": "So I want to write this down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9216, "text": "Just, in summary.", "label": []}
{"id": 9217, "text": "So the error fraction, if you like, which is sort of the number of significant digits that we have in our measurement, is proportional, in this case, to this quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9218, "text": "It happens to be proportional to this quantity here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9219, "text": "And the factor is, happens to be, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9220, "text": "So these proportionality factors are what we're looking for.", "label": []}
{"id": 9221, "text": "Their rates of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 9222, "text": "Their rates of change of something with respect to something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 9223, "text": "Now, on your homework, you have something rather similar to this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9225, "text": "And the speed of the pitch is changing depending on how high the mound is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9226, "text": "And the point here is that that's approximately proportional to the change in the height of the mound.", "label": []}
{"id": 9228, "text": "And what you're trying to figure out is what the constant of proportionality is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9229, "text": "That's what you're aiming for in this problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9230, "text": "So there's a linear relationship, approximately, to all intents and purposes this is an equality.", "label": []}
{"id": 9231, "text": "Because the lower order terms are unimportant for the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9232, "text": "Just as over here, this function is a little bit complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9233, "text": "This function is a little more simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 9234, "text": "For the purposes of this problem, they are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 9235, "text": "Because the errors are negligible for the particular problem that we're working on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9236, "text": "So we might as well work with the simpler relationship.", "label": []}
{"id": 9237, "text": "And similarly, over here, so you could do this with, in this case with square roots, it's not so hard here with reciprocals of square roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 9238, "text": "It's also not terribly hard to do it numerically.", "label": []}
{"id": 9239, "text": "And the reason why we're not doing it numerically is that, as I say, this is something that happens all across engineering.", "label": []}
{"id": 9240, "text": "People are looking for these linear relationships between the change in some input and the change in the output.", "label": []}
{"id": 9242, "text": "In this case the design of the satellite, it's very important.", "label": []}
{"id": 9243, "text": "The speed actually isn't just <EXPRESSION> speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9244, "text": "Because it's the relative speed of u to the satellite.", "label": []}
{"id": 9245, "text": "And you might be, it depends on your angle of sight with the satellite what the speed is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9246, "text": "So it varies quite a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9247, "text": "So you really need this rule of thumb.", "label": []}
{"id": 9248, "text": "Then there are all kinds of other considerations in this question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9249, "text": "Like, for example, there's the fact that we're sitting on Earth and so we're rotating around on what's called a non-inertial frame.", "label": []}
{"id": 9250, "text": "So there's the question of that acceleration.", "label": []}
{"id": 9251, "text": "There's the question that the gravity that I experience here on Earth is not the same as up at the satellite.", "label": []}
{"id": 9252, "text": "And that also creates a difference in time, as a result of general relativity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9253, "text": "So all of these considerations come down to formulas which are this complicated or maybe a tiny bit more.", "label": []}
{"id": 9254, "text": "Not really that much.", "label": []}
{"id": 9255, "text": "And then people simplify them enormously to these very simple-minded rules.", "label": []}
{"id": 9256, "text": "And they don't keep track of what's going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9257, "text": "So in order to design the system, you must make these simplifications, otherwise you can't even think about what's going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9258, "text": "This comes up in everything.", "label": []}
{"id": 9259, "text": "In weather forecasting, economic forecasting.", "label": []}
{"id": 9260, "text": "Figuring out whether there's going to be an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth.", "label": []}
{"id": 9261, "text": "Every single <EXPRESSION> of these things involves dozens of these considerations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9262, "text": "OK, there was a question that I saw, here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9263, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 9264, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 9266, "text": "Basically, any problem where you have a derivative, the rate of change also depends upon what the base point is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9267, "text": "That's the question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9271, "text": "And so, this varies a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9272, "text": "In fact, that's sort of a <EXPRESSION> order effect.", "label": []}
{"id": 9273, "text": "It does change the constant of proportionality.", "label": []}
{"id": 9274, "text": "It's a rate of change at a different base point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9275, "text": "Which we're considering fixed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9277, "text": "When you actually do the computations, what you discover is that it doesn't make that much difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 9278, "text": "To the a.", "label": []}
{"id": 9279, "text": "And that's something that you get from experience.", "label": []}
{"id": 9280, "text": "That it turns out, which things matter and which things don't.", "label": []}
{"id": 9281, "text": "And yet again, that's exactly the same sort of consideration but at the next order of what I'm talking about here is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9282, "text": "You have to have enough experience with numbers to know that if you take, if you vary something a little bit it's not going to change the answer that you're looking for very much.", "label": []}
{"id": 9283, "text": "And that's exactly the point that I'm making.", "label": []}
{"id": 9284, "text": "So I can't make them all at once, all such points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9285, "text": "So that's my pitch for understanding things from this point of view.", "label": []}
{"id": 9286, "text": "Now, we're going to go on, now, to quadratic approximations, which are a little more complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9287, "text": "So, we talked a little bit about this last time but I didn't finish.", "label": []}
{"id": 9288, "text": "So I want to finish this up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9290, "text": "OK, so, that's something that you really need to get a little experience with.", "label": []}
{"id": 9291, "text": "In economics, I told you they use logarithms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9296, "text": "And it's a mess.", "label": []}
{"id": 9297, "text": "And people don't do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9298, "text": "So they stick with the quadratic ones, typically.", "label": []}
{"id": 9299, "text": "So the basic formula here, and I'm going to take the base point to be <EXPRESSION>, is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9300, "text": "That's the linear part.", "label": []}
{"id": 9301, "text": "Plus this extra term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9302, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9303, "text": "And this is supposed to work for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9304, "text": "So it shows in the base point as simply as possible.", "label": []}
{"id": 9305, "text": "So here's more or less where we left off last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9306, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> thing that I said I was going to explain, which I will now, is why it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9307, "text": "So we need to know that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9308, "text": "So let's work that out here <EXPRESSION> of all.", "label": []}
{"id": 9309, "text": "So I'm just going to do it by example.", "label": []}
{"id": 9310, "text": "So if you like, the answer is just, well, what happens when you have a parabola?", "label": []}
{"id": 9311, "text": "A parabola's a quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 9312, "text": "It had better, its quadratic approximation had better be itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 9313, "text": "It's got to be the best <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9314, "text": "So it's got to be itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 9315, "text": "So this formula, if it's going to work, has to work on the nose.", "label": []}
{"id": 9316, "text": "For quadratic functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 9317, "text": "So, let's take a look.", "label": []}
{"id": 9318, "text": "If I differentiate, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9319, "text": "If I differentiate a <EXPRESSION> time, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9320, "text": "And now let's plug it in.", "label": []}
{"id": 9321, "text": "Well, we can recover, what is it that we want to recover?", "label": []}
{"id": 9322, "text": "We want to recover these numbers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> using the derivatives evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9323, "text": "So let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 9324, "text": "It's pretty easy, actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 9325, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9326, "text": "That's on the nose.", "label": []}
{"id": 9327, "text": "If you plug in <EQUATION><EQUATION>here, these terms drop out and you get a.", "label": []}
{"id": 9328, "text": "And now, <EXPRESSION>, whoops that was wrong.", "label": []}
{"id": 9329, "text": "So I wrote <EXPRESSION> but what I meant was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9330, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9331, "text": "Let's back up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9332, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so if I plug in <EQUATION> I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9333, "text": "Now, <EXPRESSION>, that's this next formula here, <EXPRESSION>, I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9334, "text": "That's also good.", "label": []}
{"id": 9335, "text": "And that's exactly what the linear approximation is supposed to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 9336, "text": "But now you notice, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9337, "text": "So to recover <EXPRESSION>, I better take half of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9338, "text": "And that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9339, "text": "That's the reason.", "label": []}
{"id": 9340, "text": "There's no chance that any other formula could work.", "label": []}
{"id": 9341, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> does.", "label": []}
{"id": 9342, "text": "So that's the explanation for the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 9343, "text": "And now I remind you that I had a collection of basic formulas written on the board.", "label": []}
{"id": 9344, "text": "And I want to just make sure we know all of them again.", "label": []}
{"id": 9345, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> of all, there was <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9346, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9347, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9348, "text": "So those were <EXPRESSION> that I mentioned last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9349, "text": "And, again, this is all for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9350, "text": "All for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION> only.", "label": []}
{"id": 9351, "text": "These are wildly wrong, Far away, but near <EXPRESSION> they're nice, good, quadratic approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9352, "text": "Now, the other <EXPRESSION> approximations that I want to mention are the logarithm and we use the base point shifted.", "label": []}
{"id": 9353, "text": "So we can put it at <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9354, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> - sorry, this is an approximately = sign there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9355, "text": "Turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9356, "text": "And the last <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9357, "text": "Now, eventually, your mind will converge on all of these and you'll find them relatively easy to memorize.", "label": []}
{"id": 9358, "text": "But it'll take some getting used to.", "label": []}
{"id": 9359, "text": "And I'm not claiming that you should recognize them and understand them all now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9360, "text": "But I'm going to put a giant box around this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9361, "text": "So the question was, you get all of these if you use that equation there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9362, "text": "That's exactly what are you going to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9363, "text": "so I already did it actually for these <EXPRESSION>, last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9364, "text": "But I didn't do it yet for these <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9365, "text": "But I will do it in about <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 9366, "text": "Well, maybe <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 9367, "text": "But <EXPRESSION> I want to explain just a few things about these.", "label": []}
{"id": 9368, "text": "They all follow from the basic formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 9369, "text": "In fact, that <EXPRESSION> deserves a pink box too, doesn't it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9370, "text": "That <EXPRESSION>'s pretty important.", "label": []}
{"id": 9371, "text": "Alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 9372, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 9373, "text": "Maybe even some little sparkles.", "label": []}
{"id": 9374, "text": "Alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 9375, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 9376, "text": "So that's pretty important.", "label": []}
{"id": 9377, "text": "Almost as important as the more basic <EXPRESSION> without this term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9378, "text": "So now, let me just tell you a little bit more about the significance.", "label": []}
{"id": 9379, "text": "Again, this is just to reinforce something that we've already done.", "label": []}
{"id": 9380, "text": "But it's closely related to what you're doing on your problem set.", "label": []}
{"id": 9381, "text": "So it's worth your while to recall this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9382, "text": "So, there's this expression that we were dealing with.", "label": []}
{"id": 9383, "text": "And we talked about it in lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 9385, "text": "So that's what we showed in lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 9386, "text": "And the way that we did that was, we took the logarithm and we wrote it as <EXPRESSION> times, sorry, the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9387, "text": "And then we evaluated the limit of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9388, "text": "And I want to do this limit again, using linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9389, "text": "To show you how easy it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9390, "text": "If you just remember the linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9391, "text": "And then we'll explain where the quadratic approximation comes in.", "label": []}
{"id": 9392, "text": "So I claim that this is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9393, "text": "Now, why is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9394, "text": "Well, that's just this linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9395, "text": "So what did I use here?", "label": []}
{"id": 9396, "text": "I used <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9397, "text": "Let <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9398, "text": "That's what I used in this approximation here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9399, "text": "And that's the linear approximation to the natural logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 9400, "text": "And this number is relatively easy to evaluate.", "label": []}
{"id": 9401, "text": "I know how to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9402, "text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9403, "text": "That's the same, well, so where does this work?", "label": []}
{"id": 9404, "text": "This works where this thing is near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9405, "text": "Which is when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9406, "text": "This thing is working only when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9407, "text": "So what it's really saying, this approximation formula, it's really saying that as we go to <EXPRESSION>, in <EXPRESSION>, this thing is going to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9408, "text": "As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9409, "text": "So that's what it's saying.", "label": []}
{"id": 9410, "text": "That's the substance there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9411, "text": "And that's how we want to use it, in many instances.", "label": []}
{"id": 9412, "text": "Just to evaluate limits.", "label": []}
{"id": 9413, "text": "We also want to realize that it's nearby when <EXPRESSION> is pretty large, like <EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9414, "text": "Now, so that's the idea of the linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9415, "text": "Now, if you want to get the rate of convergence here, so the rate of what's called convergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 9416, "text": "So convergence means how fast this is going towards that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9417, "text": "What I have to do is take the difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 9418, "text": "I have to take ln ak, and I have to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9419, "text": "And I know that this is going to <EXPRESSION>, and the question is how big is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9420, "text": "We want it to be very small.", "label": []}
{"id": 9421, "text": "And the answer we're going to get, so the answer just uses the quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9422, "text": "So if I just have a little bit more detail, then this expression here, in other words, I have the next higher order term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9423, "text": "This is like <EXPRESSION>, this is like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9424, "text": "Then I can understand how big the difference is between the expression that I've got and its limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9425, "text": "And so that's what's on your homework.", "label": []}
{"id": 9426, "text": "This is on your problem set.", "label": []}
{"id": 9427, "text": "OK, so that is more or less an explanation for <EXPRESSION> of the things that quadratic approximations are good for.", "label": []}
{"id": 9428, "text": "And I'm going to give you <EXPRESSION> more illustration.", "label": []}
{"id": 9429, "text": "<EXPRESSION> more illustration.", "label": []}
{"id": 9430, "text": "And then we'll actually check these formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 9431, "text": "Yeah, another question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9433, "text": "The answer is, in real life when you're faced with a problem like this, where some satellite is orbiting and you want to know the effects of gravity or something like that, nobody is going to tell you anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 9434, "text": "They're not even going to tell you whether a linear approximation is relevant, or a quadratic or anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 9435, "text": "So you're on your own.", "label": []}
{"id": 9436, "text": "When I give you a question, at least for right now, I'm always going to tell you.", "label": []}
{"id": 9437, "text": "But as time goes on I'd like you to get used to when it's enough to get away with a linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9438, "text": "And you should only use a quadratic approximation if somebody forces you to.", "label": []}
{"id": 9439, "text": "You should always start trying with a linear <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9440, "text": "Because the quadratic ones are much more complicated as you'll see in this next example.", "label": []}
{"id": 9441, "text": "OK, so the example that I want to use is, you're going to be stuck with it because I'm asking for the quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 9443, "text": "To what?", "label": []}
{"id": 9444, "text": "Well, this is the same function that we used in the last lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 9445, "text": "I think this was it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9446, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9447, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 9448, "text": "So, unfortunately, I stuck it in the wrong place to be able to fit this very long formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9449, "text": "So I'm going to switch it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9450, "text": "I'm just going to write it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9451, "text": "And we're going to just do the approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9452, "text": "So we're going to say quadratic, in parentheses.", "label": []}
{"id": 9453, "text": "And we'll say <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9454, "text": "So that's what I want.", "label": []}
{"id": 9455, "text": "So now, here's what I have to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9456, "text": "Well, I have to write in the quadratic approximation for <EXPRESSION>, and I'm going to use this formula right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9457, "text": "And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9458, "text": "And the other factor, I'm going to have to use this formula down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9459, "text": "because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9460, "text": "And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9461, "text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> term, and this is the <EXPRESSION> term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9462, "text": "And now I'm going to do something which is the only good thing about quadratic approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9463, "text": "They're messy, they're long, there's nothing particularly good about them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9464, "text": "But there is <EXPRESSION> good thing about them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9465, "text": "Which is that you always get to ignore the higher order terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9466, "text": "So even though this looks like a very ugly multiplication, I can do it in my head.", "label": []}
{"id": 9467, "text": "Just watching it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9468, "text": "Because I get a <EXPRESSION>, I'm forced with that term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9469, "text": "And then I get the cross terms which are linear, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9470, "text": "We already did that when we calculated the linear approximation, so that's this times the <EXPRESSION> and this times that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9471, "text": "And now I have <EXPRESSION> cross-terms which are quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 9473, "text": "So that's plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9474, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9475, "text": "And then there's this term, multiplying the <EXPRESSION>, that's plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9477, "text": "Multiplying <EXPRESSION>, and that is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9478, "text": "So the great thing is, we drop <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "label": []}
{"id": 9479, "text": "And you work it out as I'm doing it now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9480, "text": "So what I did is, I multiplied <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9481, "text": "I'm using the distributive law here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9482, "text": "That was this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9483, "text": "I multiplied this <EXPRESSION> by this <EXPRESSION>, that was that term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9484, "text": "I multiplied this by this, that's that term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9485, "text": "And then I multiplied this by this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9486, "text": "In other words, <EXPRESSION> terms that gave me an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9487, "text": "And I'm going to stop at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9488, "text": "Because the point is it's just all the rest of the terms that come up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9490, "text": "I don't have to do the higher ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 9491, "text": "Another question, way back here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9492, "text": "Yeah, right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9493, "text": "So somebody can check my arithmetic, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 9494, "text": "Good.", "label": []}
{"id": 9496, "text": "So if here's about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9497, "text": "Here's something which is on the order of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9501, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9502, "text": "And the point is that I'm not claiming that I have an exact answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 9503, "text": "And I'm going to drop things of that order of magnitude.", "label": []}
{"id": 9504, "text": "So I'm saving everything up to <EXPRESSION> decimal places.", "label": []}
{"id": 9505, "text": "I'm throwing away things which are <EXPRESSION> decimal places out.", "label": []}
{"id": 9506, "text": "Does that answer your question?", "label": []}
{"id": 9507, "text": "That's the situation, and now you can combine the terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9508, "text": "I mean, it's not very impressive here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9509, "text": "This = <EXPRESSION>, maybe <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9511, "text": "Anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 9512, "text": "So, this is a <EXPRESSION> here, sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 9513, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9514, "text": "This is the linear approximation we got last time and here's the extra information that we got from this calculation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9515, "text": "Which is this <EXPRESSION> term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9516, "text": "Right, you have to accept that there's a certain degree of complexity to this problem and the answer is sufficiently complicated so it can't be less arithmetic because we get this peculiar <EXPRESSION> there, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 9517, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> of the things to realize is that these kinds of problems, because they involve many, many terms are always going to involve a little bit of complicated arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 9519, "text": "Did the ones in the left column.", "label": []}
{"id": 9520, "text": "So let's carry that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 9521, "text": "And as someone just pointed out, it all comes from this formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9522, "text": "So let's just check it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9523, "text": "So we'll start with the ln function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9524, "text": "This is the function, <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9525, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9526, "text": "And now I have to plug in <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9527, "text": "So at <EQUATION> this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9528, "text": "So this is at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9529, "text": "I'm getting <EXPRESSION> here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9530, "text": "And here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9531, "text": "So now I go and I look up at that formula, which is way in that upper corner there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9532, "text": "And I see that the coefficient on the constant is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9533, "text": "The coefficient on <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9534, "text": "And then the other coefficient, the very last <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9535, "text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9536, "text": "And then in the formula, there's a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9537, "text": "So it's half of whatever I get for this <EXPRESSION> derivative, at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9538, "text": "So this is the approximation formula, which is way up in that corner there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9539, "text": "Similarly, if I do it for <EXPRESSION>, I have to differentiate that I get <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9540, "text": "So here are the derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 9541, "text": "And so if I evaluate them at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9542, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9543, "text": "And here I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9544, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9545, "text": "And here, I plug in <EQUATION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9546, "text": "So again, the pattern is right above it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9547, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> is there, the <EXPRESSION> is there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9548, "text": "And then instead of <EXPRESSION>, I have half that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9549, "text": "For the coefficient.", "label": []}
{"id": 9550, "text": "So these are just examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 9551, "text": "Obviously if we had a more complicated functional, we might carry this out.", "label": []}
{"id": 9552, "text": "But as a practical matter, we try to stick with the ones in the pink box and just use algebra to get other formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 9553, "text": "So I want to shift gears now and treat the subject that was supposed to be this lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 9554, "text": "And we're not quite caught up, but we will try to do our best to do as much as we can today.", "label": []}
{"id": 9555, "text": "So the next topic is curve sketching.", "label": []}
{"id": 9556, "text": "And so let's get started with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9557, "text": "So now, happily in this subject, there are more pictures and it's a little bit more geometric.", "label": []}
{"id": 9558, "text": "And there's relatively little computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9559, "text": "So let's hope we can do this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9560, "text": "So I want to, so here we go, we'll start with curve sketching.", "label": []}
{"id": 9561, "text": "Yeah, there are certain kinds of things which I can't spell.", "label": []}
{"id": 9562, "text": "But, alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 9563, "text": "Sketching.", "label": []}
{"id": 9564, "text": "Alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 9565, "text": "So here's our goal.", "label": []}
{"id": 9566, "text": "Our goal is to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>, using <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9567, "text": "Whether they're positive or negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9568, "text": "So that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9569, "text": "This is the goal here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9570, "text": "However, there is a big warning that I want to give you.", "label": []}
{"id": 9571, "text": "And this is <EXPRESSION> that unfortunately I now have to make you unlearn, especially those that you that have actually had a little bit of calculus before, I want to make you unlearn some of your instincts that you developed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9572, "text": "So this will be harder for those of you who have actually done this before.", "label": []}
{"id": 9573, "text": "But for the rest of you, it will be relatively easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 9574, "text": "Which is, don't abandon your precalculus skills.", "label": []}
{"id": 9575, "text": "And common sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9576, "text": "So there's a great deal of common sense in this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9577, "text": "And it actually trumps some of the calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9578, "text": "The calculus just fills in what you didn't quite know yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 9579, "text": "So I will try to illustrate this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9580, "text": "And because we're running a bit late, I won't get to the some of the main punchlines until next lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 9581, "text": "But I want you to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9582, "text": "So for now, I'm just going to tell you about the general principles.", "label": []}
{"id": 9583, "text": "And in the process I'm going to introduce the terminology.", "label": []}
{"id": 9584, "text": "Just, the words that we need to use to describe what is that we're doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9585, "text": "And there's also a certain amount of carelessness with that in many of the treatments that you'll see.", "label": []}
{"id": 9586, "text": "And a lot of hastiness.", "label": []}
{"id": 9587, "text": "So just be a little patient and we will do this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9588, "text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> principle is the following.", "label": []}
{"id": 9590, "text": "That's a straightforward idea, and it's closely related to this tangent line approximation or the linear approximation that I just did.", "label": []}
{"id": 9591, "text": "You can just imagine.", "label": []}
{"id": 9592, "text": "Here's the tangent line, here's the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9593, "text": "And if the tangent line is pointing up, then the function is also going up, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 9594, "text": "So that's all that's going on here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9596, "text": "And that's the basic idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 9597, "text": "Now, the <EXPRESSION> step is also fairly straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 9599, "text": "If you have <EXPRESSION> as positive, then that means that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9600, "text": "That's the same principle applied <EXPRESSION> step up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9601, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9602, "text": "Because if <EXPRESSION> is positive, that means it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9603, "text": "So it's the same principle just repeated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9604, "text": "And now I just want to draw a picture of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9605, "text": "Here's a picture of it, I claim.", "label": []}
{"id": 9606, "text": "And it looks like something's going down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9607, "text": "And I did that on purpose.", "label": []}
{"id": 9608, "text": "But there is something that's increasing here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9609, "text": "Which is, the slope is very steep negative here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9610, "text": "And it's less steep negative over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9611, "text": "So we have the slope which is some negative number, say, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9612, "text": "And here it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9613, "text": "So it's increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9614, "text": "It's getting less negative, and maybe eventually it'll curve up the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9615, "text": "And this is a picture of what I'm talking about here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9616, "text": "That's what it means to say that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9617, "text": "The slope is getting larger.", "label": []}
{"id": 9618, "text": "And the way to describe a curve like this is that it's concave.", "label": []}
{"id": 9619, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is concave up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9620, "text": "And similarly, <EXPRESSION> negative is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION> concave, or implies <EXPRESSION> concave down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9621, "text": "So those are the ways in which derivatives will help us qualitatively to draw graphs.", "label": []}
{"id": 9622, "text": "But as I said before, we still have to use a little bit of common sense when we draw the graphs.", "label": []}
{"id": 9623, "text": "These are just the additional bits of help that we have from calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9624, "text": "In drawing pictures.", "label": []}
{"id": 9625, "text": "So I'm going to go through <EXPRESSION> example to introduce all the notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9626, "text": "And then eventually, so probably at the beginning of next time, I'll give you a systematic strategy that's going to work when what I'm describing now goes wrong, or a little bit wrong.", "label": []}
{"id": 9627, "text": "So let's begin with a straightforward example.", "label": []}
{"id": 9628, "text": "So, the <EXPRESSION> example that I'll give you is the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9629, "text": "Just, as I said, to be able to introduce all the notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9630, "text": "Now, if you differentiate it, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9631, "text": "And I can factor that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9632, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9633, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 9634, "text": "And so, I can decide whether the derivative is positive or negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9635, "text": "Easily enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 9636, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is a positive number and <EXPRESSION> is a positive number.", "label": []}
{"id": 9637, "text": "So, in this range, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 9638, "text": "So this thing is, so <EXPRESSION> is increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9639, "text": "And similarly, in the other ranges, if <EXPRESSION> is very, very large, this becomes, if it crosses <EXPRESSION>, in fact, this becomes, this factor becomes negative and this <EXPRESSION> stays positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 9640, "text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is decreasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9641, "text": "And the same thing goes for the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 9642, "text": "When it's less than <EXPRESSION>, that also works this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9643, "text": "Because when it's less than <EXPRESSION>, this number factors positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 9644, "text": "But the other <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9645, "text": "So in both of these cases, we get that it's decreasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9646, "text": "So now, here's the schematic picture of this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9647, "text": "So here's <EXPRESSION>, here's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9648, "text": "It's going to go down, up, down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9649, "text": "That's what it's doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9650, "text": "Maybe I'll just leave it alone like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9651, "text": "That's what it looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 9652, "text": "So, this is the kind of information we can get right off the bat.", "label": []}
{"id": 9653, "text": "And you notice immediately that it's very important, from the features of the function, the sort of key features of the function that we see here, are these <EXPRESSION> places.", "label": []}
{"id": 9654, "text": "Maybe I'll even mark them in a, like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9655, "text": "And these things are turning points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9656, "text": "So what are they?", "label": []}
{"id": 9657, "text": "Well, they're just the points where the derivative changes sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 9658, "text": "Where it's negative here and it's positive there, so there it must be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9659, "text": "So we have a definition, and this is the most important definition in this subject, which is that is if <EXPRESSION>, we call <EXPRESSION> a critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9660, "text": "The word 'turning point' is not used just because, in fact, it doesn't have to turn around at those points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9661, "text": "But certainly, if it turns around then this will happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 9662, "text": "And we also have another notation, which is the number <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION> is called a critical value.", "label": []}
{"id": 9663, "text": "So these are the key numbers that we're going to have to work out in order to understand what the function looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 9664, "text": "So what I'm going to do is just plot them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9665, "text": "We're going to plot the critical points and the values.", "label": []}
{"id": 9666, "text": "Well, we found the critical points relatively easily.", "label": []}
{"id": 9667, "text": "I didn't write it down here but it's pretty obvious.", "label": []}
{"id": 9668, "text": "If you set <EQUATION>, that implies that <EQUATION>, which implies that <EXPRESSION> is or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9669, "text": "So those are known as the critical points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9670, "text": "And now, in order to get the critical values here, I have to plug in <EXPRESSION>, for instance, the function is <EXPRESSION>, so there's this <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9671, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9672, "text": "And so I can plot the function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9673, "text": "So here's the point <EXPRESSION> and here's, up here, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9674, "text": "So this is - whoops, which <EXPRESSION> is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 9675, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 9676, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9677, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9678, "text": "And then over here, I have the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9679, "text": "Alright, now, what information do I get from - so I've now plotted <EXPRESSION>, I claim, very interesting points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9680, "text": "What information do I get from this?", "label": []}
{"id": 9681, "text": "The answer is, I know something very nearby.", "label": []}
{"id": 9682, "text": "Because I've already checked that the thing is coming down from the left, and coming back up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9683, "text": "And so it must be shaped like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9684, "text": "Over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9685, "text": "The tangent line is <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be level there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9686, "text": "And similarly over here, it's going to do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9687, "text": "So this is what we know so far, based on what we've computed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9688, "text": "Question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9689, "text": "The answer is, calculus, it's not called a critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9690, "text": "It's a something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 9691, "text": "And it's a very important point, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 9692, "text": "And we will be discussing those kinds of points.", "label": []}
{"id": 9693, "text": "There are much more dramatic instances of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9694, "text": "That's part of what we're going to say.", "label": []}
{"id": 9695, "text": "But I just want to save that, alright.", "label": []}
{"id": 9696, "text": "We will be discussing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9697, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 9698, "text": "Question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9701, "text": "The answer is that I actually did not use the <EXPRESSION> derivative yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 9702, "text": "What I used is another piece of information.", "label": []}
{"id": 9703, "text": "I used the information that I derived over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9704, "text": "That <EXPRESSION> is positive, where <EXPRESSION> is positive and where it's negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9705, "text": "So what I know is that the graph is going down to the left of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9706, "text": "It's going up to the right, here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9707, "text": "It's going up here and it's going down there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9708, "text": "I did not use the <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9709, "text": "I used the <EXPRESSION> derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9710, "text": "OK, but I didn't just use the fact that there was a turning point here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9711, "text": "So, actually, I was using the fact that it was a turning point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9712, "text": "I wasn't using the fact that it had the <EXPRESSION> derivative, though.", "label": []}
{"id": 9713, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 9714, "text": "For now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9715, "text": "You can also see it by the <EXPRESSION> derivative as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 9716, "text": "So now, the next thing that I'd like to do, I need to finish off this graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 9717, "text": "And I just want to do it a little bit carefully here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9718, "text": "In the order that is reasonable.", "label": []}
{"id": 9719, "text": "Now, you might happen to notice, and there's nothing wrong with this, so let's even fill in a guess.", "label": []}
{"id": 9720, "text": "In order to fill in a guess, though, and have it be even vaguely right, I do have to notice that this thing crosses, this function crosses the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 9721, "text": "The function <EQUATION> happens also have the property that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9722, "text": "Again, common sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9723, "text": "You're allowed to use your common sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9724, "text": "You're allowed to notice a value of the function and put it in.", "label": []}
{"id": 9725, "text": "So there's nothing wrong with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9726, "text": "If you happen to have such a value.", "label": []}
{"id": 9727, "text": "So, now we can guess what our function is going to look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 9728, "text": "It's going to maybe come down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9729, "text": "Come up like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9730, "text": "And come down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9731, "text": "That could be what it looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 9732, "text": "But, you know, another possibility is it sort of comes along here and goes out that way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9733, "text": "Comes along here and goes out that way, who knows?", "label": []}
{"id": 9734, "text": "It happens, by the way, that it's an odd function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9735, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9736, "text": "Those are all odd powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 9737, "text": "So, actually, it's symmetric on the right half and the left half.", "label": []}
{"id": 9738, "text": "And crosses at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9739, "text": "So everything that we do on the right is going to be the same as what happens on the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 9740, "text": "That's another piece of common sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9741, "text": "You want to make use of that as much as possible, whenever you're drawing anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 9742, "text": "Don't want to throw out information.", "label": []}
{"id": 9743, "text": "So this function happens to be odd.", "label": []}
{"id": 9744, "text": "Odd, and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9745, "text": "I'm considering those to be kinds of precalculus skills that I want you to use as much as you can.", "label": []}
{"id": 9746, "text": "So now, here's the <EXPRESSION> feature which is unfortunately ignored in most discussions of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 9747, "text": "And it's strange, because nowadays we have graphing things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9748, "text": "And it's really the only part of the exercise that you couldn't do, at least on this relatively simpleminded level, with a graphing calculator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9749, "text": "And that is what I would call the ends of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9750, "text": "So what happens off the screen, is the question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9751, "text": "And that basically is the theoretical part of the problem that you have to address.", "label": []}
{"id": 9752, "text": "You can program this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9753, "text": "You can draw all the pictures that you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 9754, "text": "But what you won't see is what's off the screen.", "label": []}
{"id": 9755, "text": "You need to know something to figure out what's off the screen.", "label": []}
{"id": 9756, "text": "So, in this case, I'm talking about what's off the screen going to the right, or going to the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 9757, "text": "So let's check the ends.", "label": []}
{"id": 9758, "text": "So here, let's just take a look.", "label": []}
{"id": 9759, "text": "We have the function <EXPRESSION>, which is, sorry, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9760, "text": "Again this is a precalculus sort of thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9761, "text": "And we're imagining now, let's just do <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9762, "text": "So what happens here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9763, "text": "When <EXPRESSION> is gigantic, this term is completely negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 9764, "text": "And it just behaves like <EXPRESSION>, which goes to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9765, "text": "And similarly, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9767, "text": "Let's have we have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9768, "text": "Or I guess we can just say <EQUATION> if we didn't want to write it with the function notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9769, "text": "And that's all fair and well and this works out well.", "label": []}
{"id": 9770, "text": "This is a separable differential equation and we can integrate things quite easily.", "label": []}
{"id": 9771, "text": "But as you will see as you go further in the world of differential equations, most differential equations are not so easy to solve.", "label": []}
{"id": 9772, "text": "In fact, many of them are impossible to solve using analytic methods.", "label": []}
{"id": 9773, "text": "And so given that, what do you do?", "label": []}
{"id": 9774, "text": "We've nicely described some phenomena, modeled some phenomena using the differential equations but if you can't solve it analytically do you just give up?", "label": []}
{"id": 9775, "text": "And the answer to that question is no.", "label": []}
{"id": 9776, "text": "You do not just give up because we now have computers, and computers are really good at numerical methods.", "label": []}
{"id": 9777, "text": "Numerical methods for approximating and giving us a sense of what the solution to a differential equation might look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 9778, "text": "And so how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9779, "text": "Well, in this video we can explore <EXPRESSION> of the most straightforward numerical methods for approximating a particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 9780, "text": "So what we do is, so I'm gonna draw a little table here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9781, "text": "So, a little table here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9782, "text": "Actually let give myself.", "label": []}
{"id": 9783, "text": "I'm gonna do it over here on the left hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 9784, "text": "A little table.", "label": []}
{"id": 9785, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9786, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9787, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9788, "text": "And you could set up a table like this to create a slope field.", "label": []}
{"id": 9789, "text": "You could just pick all the.", "label": []}
{"id": 9790, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9793, "text": "And we're gonna do something kind of related but instead of trying to construct a slope field, we're gonna start with this initial condition.", "label": []}
{"id": 9794, "text": "Let <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9797, "text": "So we're gonna start with <EQUATION> and let me do this in a different color.", "label": []}
{"id": 9798, "text": "We're gonna start with <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9799, "text": "Which is that point right over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9800, "text": "And we're gonna say, well, okay what is the derivative at that point?", "label": []}
{"id": 9801, "text": "Well, we know the derivative at any point that's for any solution to this differential equation the derivative is going to be = the <EXPRESSION> value.", "label": []}
{"id": 9802, "text": "So in this case, the derivative is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9803, "text": "It's going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9804, "text": "And in general, if the derivative just like what we saw in the case of slope fields, as long as the derivative is expressed as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then you can figure out what the slope of the tangent line will be at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9805, "text": "And so, you say okay, there's a slope of <EXPRESSION> at that point so I can depict it like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9806, "text": "And instead of just keep doing that with a bunch of points we'll say okay, well let's just.", "label": []}
{"id": 9809, "text": "We know that the slope is changing or it's probably changing for most cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 9810, "text": "But let's just assume it's fixed until our next <EXPRESSION> and then use that assumption to estimate what the next <EXPRESSION> would be.", "label": []}
{"id": 9811, "text": "So, what am I talking about here?", "label": []}
{"id": 9812, "text": "So, when I talk about the next <EXPRESSION> we're talking about well, let's just step.", "label": []}
{"id": 9813, "text": "Let's just say for the sake of simplicity, we're gonna have a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9814, "text": "A <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9815, "text": "So we're gonna step from <EQUATION> now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9816, "text": "We're gonna now step from that to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9817, "text": "So we're now gonna go to.", "label": []}
{"id": 9818, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9820, "text": "Actually I may not use that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9821, "text": "I used that yellow color already for the actual graph or for the actual <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9822, "text": "So now let's say <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9823, "text": "Our <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9824, "text": "So we've just added <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9825, "text": "And what we can do in our little approximation scheme here is well, let's just assume that that slope was constant over that interval.", "label": []}
{"id": 9826, "text": "So where does that get us to?", "label": []}
{"id": 9828, "text": "So then <EXPRESSION> is going to increase by <EXPRESSION> and is going to get to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9829, "text": "And we see that point right over there and you already might see where this is going.", "label": []}
{"id": 9830, "text": "Now, if this were actually a point on the curve, on the solution, and if it was satisfying this, what would then the derivative be?", "label": []}
{"id": 9831, "text": "Well, the derivative = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9832, "text": "The slope of the tangent line is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9833, "text": "So, in this case, the slope of the tangent line is now going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9834, "text": "And we could depict that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9835, "text": "Let me depict that in magenta here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9836, "text": "So, it is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9837, "text": "It's gonna look.", "label": []}
{"id": 9838, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9840, "text": "So the slope of the tangent line there is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9841, "text": "And so, what does that tell us?", "label": []}
{"id": 9842, "text": "Well if we step by our <EXPRESSION> more.", "label": []}
{"id": 9843, "text": "Set <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9844, "text": "What should the corresponding <EXPRESSION> be?", "label": []}
{"id": 9845, "text": "Well, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 9846, "text": "Now for every <EXPRESSION> that we increase in the <EXPRESSION> direction we should increase <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction because the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9847, "text": "So, the very next <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9848, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9849, "text": "So, we could imagine we have now kind of had a constant slope when we get to that point right over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9850, "text": "And now we can do the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9851, "text": "Well if we assume <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> based on the differential equation it has to be = <EXPRESSION>, okay, the slope of the tangent line there is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9852, "text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9853, "text": "And so, if we step our <EXPRESSION> up by <EXPRESSION>, if we increment our <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> again, once again, we just decided to increment by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9854, "text": "We could have incremented by <EXPRESSION>, we could have incremented by.", "label": []}
{"id": 9855, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9856, "text": "And you could guess which <EXPRESSION>'s going to give you a more accurate result.", "label": []}

{"id": 9860, "text": "If we increase <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> we're gonna increase <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9861, "text": "So we are going to get to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9862, "text": "And so, we are at the point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION> which is right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9863, "text": "And so, for this next stretch, the next stretch is going to look like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9864, "text": "And as you can see just by doing this, we haven't been able to approximate what the particular solution looks like and you might say, \"Hey, so how do we know \"that's not so good of an approximation?", "label": []}

{"id": 9914, "text": "So there's a bunch of interesting things here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9915, "text": "This is actually how most differential equations or techniques that are derived from this or that are based on numerical methods similar to this are how most differential equations gets solved.", "label": []}
{"id": 9916, "text": "You know it's not the exact same solution or the same method that the idea that most differential equations are actually solved or I guess you can say simulated with a numerical method because most of them actually cannot be solved in analytical form.", "label": []}
{"id": 9917, "text": "Now you might be saying, \"Hey, well what method is \"this <EXPRESSION> right over here called?", "label": []}

{"id": 9920, "text": "Euler's Method.", "label": []}
{"id": 9922, "text": "Anyway, hopefully you found that exciting.", "label": []}
{"id": 9923, "text": "Now I introduce you to the concept of exact equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9924, "text": "And it's just another method for solving a certain type of differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9925, "text": "Let me write that down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9926, "text": "Exact equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9927, "text": "Before I show you what an exact equation is, I'm just going to give you a little bit of the building blocks, just so that when I later prove it, or at least give you the intuition behind it, it doesn't seem like it's coming out of the blue.", "label": []}
{"id": 9928, "text": "So let's say I had some function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and we'll call it <EXPRESSION>, just because that's what people tend to use for these exact equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9929, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9930, "text": "So you're probably not familiar with taking the chain rule onto partial derivatives, but I'll show it to you now, and I'll give you a little intuition, although I won't prove it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9932, "text": "Undo.", "label": []}
{"id": 9933, "text": "So I could also write this as <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9934, "text": "I could write it just like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9935, "text": "These are just <EXPRESSION> different ways of writing the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9937, "text": "And I won't prove it, but I'll give you the intuition right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9939, "text": "And this is should make a little bit of intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 9941, "text": "But if these canceled out, then you'd kind of have another partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9942, "text": "And if you were to kind of add them up, then you would get the full derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9943, "text": "That's not even the intuition, that's just to show you that even this should make a little bit of intuitive sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 9944, "text": "Now the intuition here, let's just say <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> doesn't always have to take this form, but you could use this same methodology to take <EXPRESSION> to more complex notations.", "label": []}

{"id": 9950, "text": "I just defined <EXPRESSION> like this just so I can give you the intuition that when I use implicit differentiation on this, when I take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, I actually get something that looks just like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9951, "text": "So what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9952, "text": "And this is just the implicit differentiation that you learned, or that you hopefully learned, in your <EXPRESSION> semester calculus course.", "label": []}
{"id": 9953, "text": "That's =, and we just do the product rule, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9954, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> expression, you take the derivative of that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9955, "text": "Well, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION> function, well, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9956, "text": "Now you add that to the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function times the <EXPRESSION> function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9957, "text": "So plus <EXPRESSION>, that's just the <EXPRESSION> function, times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9958, "text": "Now the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function, it's going to be this function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9959, "text": "So you could write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9960, "text": "But of course, we're doing the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 9961, "text": "So it's that times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9962, "text": "And you might want to review the implicit differentiation videos if that seems a little bit foreign.", "label": []}
{"id": 9963, "text": "But this right here, what I just did, this expression right here, this is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9964, "text": "And we have <EXPRESSION> terms like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9965, "text": "So if we keep adding them, I'll do them vertically down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9966, "text": "So plus, and then you have a bunch of them, and the last <EXPRESSION>'s going to look the same, it's just the nth function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9967, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> function, <EXPRESSION>, plus the <EXPRESSION> function, <EXPRESSION>, times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9968, "text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> function with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 9970, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9971, "text": "Now, we have <EXPRESSION> n terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9972, "text": "We have <EXPRESSION> terms here, right, where each term was a <EXPRESSION> times a <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, and then all the way to fn of <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9973, "text": "Now for each of those, we got <EXPRESSION> of them when we did the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 9974, "text": "If we group the terms, so if we group all the terms that don't have a <EXPRESSION> on them, what do we get?", "label": []}
{"id": 9975, "text": "If we add all of these, I guess you could call them on the left hand side, I'm just rearranging, it all = <EXPRESSION>, plus <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, all the way to <EXPRESSION>e, I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9976, "text": "That's just all of these added up, plus all of these added up.", "label": []}
{"id": 9977, "text": "All the terms that have the <EXPRESSION> in them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9978, "text": "And I'll do them in a different color.", "label": []}
{"id": 9979, "text": "So all of these terms are going to be in a different color.", "label": []}
{"id": 9980, "text": "I'll do it in a different parentheses.", "label": []}
{"id": 9981, "text": "Plus <EXPRESSION>, and I'll do the <EXPRESSION> later, I'll distribute it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 9982, "text": "Plus, and we have <EXPRESSION> terms, plus <EXPRESSION>, and then all of these terms are multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9983, "text": "Now, something looks interesting here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9984, "text": "We originally defined our <EXPRESSION>, up here, as this right here, but what is this green term?", "label": []}
{"id": 9985, "text": "Well, what we did is we took all of these individual terms, and these green terms here are just taking the derivative with respect to just <EXPRESSION> on each of these terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 9986, "text": "Because if you take the derivative just with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this, then the function of <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9987, "text": "If you were to take just a partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9988, "text": "So if you took the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this term, you treat a function of <EXPRESSION> as a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 9989, "text": "So the derivative of this would just be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, because <EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 9990, "text": "And so forth and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9991, "text": "All of these green terms you can view as a partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9992, "text": "We just pretended like <EXPRESSION> is a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 9993, "text": "And that same logic, if you ignore this, if you just look at this part right here, what is this?", "label": []}
{"id": 9994, "text": "We took <EXPRESSION>, up here, we treated the functions of <EXPRESSION> as a constant, and we just took the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9995, "text": "And that's why the primes are on all the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9996, "text": "And then we multiply that times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9997, "text": "So you could write this, this = I'll do this green this green is the same thing as the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9998, "text": "Plus, what's this purple, this part of the purple?", "label": []}
{"id": 9999, "text": "Let me do it in a different color, in magenta.", "label": []}
{"id": 10000, "text": "This, right here, is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10001, "text": "So that's essentially all I wanted to show you right now in this video, because I realize I'm almost running out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 10002, "text": "That the chain rule, with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the variables, but the <EXPRESSION> variable in the function is also a function of <EXPRESSION>, the chain rule is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10004, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> wasn't a function of <EXPRESSION>, or if <EXPRESSION> if it was independent of <EXPRESSION>, than <EXPRESSION> would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10005, "text": "And this term would be <EXPRESSION>, and then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> would be just the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10006, "text": "But anyway, I want you to just keep this in mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 10007, "text": "And in this video I didn't prove it, but I hopefully gave you a little intuition if I didn't confuse you.", "label": []}
{"id": 10008, "text": "And we're going to use this property in the next series of videos to understand exact equations a little bit more.", "label": []}
{"id": 10009, "text": "I realize that in this video I just got as far as kind of giving you an intuition here.", "label": []}
{"id": 10010, "text": "I haven't told you yet what an exact equation is.", "label": []}
{"id": 10011, "text": "I will see you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 14444, "text": "Let's say that I had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation: the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14445, "text": "So you might say, wow, this is a tremendously complicated problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 14446, "text": "I have the <EXPRESSION> types of functions I've been exposed to, I would have so many undetermined coefficients, it would get really unwieldy.", "label": []}
{"id": 14447, "text": "And this is where you need to make a simplifying realization.", "label": []}
{"id": 14448, "text": "We know the <EXPRESSION> particular solutions to the following differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14449, "text": "And then let me just write this out a couple of times <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14450, "text": "We know the solution to this one, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 14451, "text": "This was another particular solution we found.", "label": []}
{"id": 14452, "text": "I think it was <EXPRESSION> videos ago.", "label": []}
{"id": 14453, "text": "And we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14454, "text": "Sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 14455, "text": "The particular solution was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14456, "text": "And then finally this last polynomial, we could call it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14457, "text": "We know the solution when that was just the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14458, "text": "That was this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14459, "text": "And there we figured out and this was in the last video.", "label": []}
{"id": 14460, "text": "So we know the particular solution when <EXPRESSION> on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14461, "text": "We know it when just <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14462, "text": "We know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14463, "text": "And we know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14464, "text": "First of all, the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation, we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14465, "text": "And that makes sense, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14466, "text": "Because one of the particular solutions, like this one when you put it on the left hand side, it will just = this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14467, "text": "This particular solution, when you put it in the left hand side, will = this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14468, "text": "Set the left hand side to = the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14469, "text": "And then you could add the homogeneous solution to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14470, "text": "You put it in the left side and you'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14471, "text": "So it won't change the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14472, "text": "And then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition.", "label": []}
{"id": 14473, "text": "So the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14474, "text": "Let me clean up some space because I want everything to be on the board at the same time.", "label": []}
{"id": 14475, "text": "So the solution is going to be well, I want that to be deleted.", "label": []}
{"id": 14476, "text": "I'll do it in baby blue.", "label": []}
{"id": 14477, "text": "And then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation, if this was a 0 on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14478, "text": "And then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.", "label": []}
{"id": 14479, "text": "See you in the next video, where we'll start learning another method for solving nonhomogeneous equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14480, "text": "Take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, what do I get?", "label": []}
{"id": 14481, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14482, "text": "Let's multiply by <EXPRESSION> so that we have the formula for P canonical.", "label": []}
{"id": 14483, "text": "So when I exponentiate that, it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14484, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 14485, "text": "So what did we arrive at?", "label": []}
{"id": 14486, "text": "We arrived at the van der Waals equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14487, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 14488, "text": "Well, let's write both of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 14489, "text": "Well, let me write <EXPRESSION>, and this is just the definition of the transform, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14490, "text": "Take the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14491, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14492, "text": "If we take the derivative of this, <EXPRESSION> cancels out, and you just get that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14493, "text": "And then if we make our <EXPRESSION> let me pick a good color here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14494, "text": "If we make this = our <EXPRESSION>, what's our <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 14495, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14496, "text": "Fair enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 14497, "text": "So let's apply the integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 14498, "text": "So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14499, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, I'll use this <EXPRESSION>, so <EQUATION>, that's our <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14500, "text": "Let me write this down so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14501, "text": "Let me do it in that color.", "label": []}
{"id": 14502, "text": "I'm just rewriting this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14503, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14504, "text": "So that's the <EXPRESSION> term right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14505, "text": "Let me make that clear.", "label": []}
{"id": 14506, "text": "And let me pick a good color here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14507, "text": "So this term right here is this term right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14508, "text": "And, of course, I'm going to have to evaluate this from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14509, "text": "So, let me write that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14510, "text": "I could put a little bracket there or something, but you know we're going to have to evaluate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14511, "text": "And then from that, we're going to have to subtract the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 14512, "text": "And let me not forget our boundaries.", "label": []}
{"id": 14513, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14514, "text": "And then all of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14515, "text": "Of course, we have our <EXPRESSION>, and you have a minus minus.", "label": []}
{"id": 14516, "text": "These things become pluses.", "label": []}
{"id": 14517, "text": "Let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 14518, "text": "So when you've evaluate what's the limit of this as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 14519, "text": "As <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION>, this term, you might say, oh, this becomes really big.", "label": []}
{"id": 14520, "text": "And I went over this in the last video.", "label": []}
{"id": 14521, "text": "But this term overpowers it, because you're going to have <EXPRESSION>, if we assume that <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14522, "text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>, this term is going to win out and go to <EXPRESSION> much faster than this term is going to go to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14523, "text": "So when you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, when you evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, you're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14524, "text": "And then you're going to subtract this evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14525, "text": "This evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, when it's evaluated at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14526, "text": "Well, this becomes <EXPRESSION> as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 14527, "text": "So this whole term evaluated from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> is all <EXPRESSION>, which is a nice, convenient thing for us.", "label": []}
{"id": 14528, "text": "And then we're going to have this next term right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14529, "text": "So let's take out the constant terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 14530, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> are constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14531, "text": "They are constant with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14532, "text": "So you have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14533, "text": "Now, this should look reasonably familiar to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 14534, "text": "Well, when we have an <EXPRESSION>, we're taking the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, so this whole integral = the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14535, "text": "So just that easily, because this term went to <EXPRESSION>, we've simplified things integral right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14536, "text": "Well, this is a nice, neat simplification.", "label": []}
{"id": 14537, "text": "So let's see if we can use this with this information to get a generalized formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14538, "text": "So let me write that down <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14539, "text": "I could write this as <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>, where <EXPRESSION> is greater than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14540, "text": "Well, we can just use this formula up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14541, "text": "Well, t, we know what that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14542, "text": "Let's see if we can do another one.", "label": []}
{"id": 14543, "text": "Well, we just use this formula up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14544, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14545, "text": "In this case, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14546, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14547, "text": "This is just this right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14548, "text": "So it's = <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14549, "text": "And I'm going to actually write it this way, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14550, "text": "Let's do another one.", "label": []}
{"id": 14551, "text": "And I think you already are getting the idea of what's going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 14552, "text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14553, "text": "And that's just <EXPRESSION> this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14554, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14555, "text": "So now <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14556, "text": "And so you can just get the general principle.", "label": []}
{"id": 14557, "text": "And we can prove this by induction.", "label": []}

{"id": 14559, "text": "So let's let <EQUATION>, that's a natural quantity to look at, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14560, "text": "And that is between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, it's just a fraction of white balls in the population.", "label": []}

{"id": 14569, "text": "And I just have to explain the notation a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 14570, "text": "Here we transformed capital <EXPRESSION> to capital <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14571, "text": "So a natural thing to do is to mirror that notation with the lowercase letters.", "label": []}
{"id": 14572, "text": "We define <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14573, "text": "So we're doing the same transformation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14574, "text": "Let's write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14575, "text": "So all I'm saying to do is plug in <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14576, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> viewed as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14577, "text": "And there are several variations on this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14578, "text": "In particular, you can also do <EXPRESSION> is the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 14579, "text": "This is just intro of calculus again, but it's useful to point out.", "label": []}

{"id": 14587, "text": "Either we could do <EXPRESSION> directly, or we could take <EXPRESSION> and flip it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14588, "text": "And then we just have to remember to write it as a function of <EXPRESSION>, either way.", "label": []}
{"id": 14589, "text": "Strictly increasing.", "label": []}
{"id": 14590, "text": "So a common mistake on this kind of problem would be to just try to blindly plug into this formula for a function like <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14592, "text": "I'm not saying that's not a nice function, it's a parabola.", "label": []}

{"id": 14594, "text": "Don't just plug into the formula all without checking the assumptions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14595, "text": "All right, so let's prove this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14596, "text": "And the proof should be pretty easy, just based on kind of similar calculations we did before.", "label": []}

{"id": 14599, "text": "So let's do that pretty quickly.", "label": []}
{"id": 14600, "text": "So now let's just take the derivative of both sides, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14601, "text": "So chain rules says I can differentiate first with respect to <EXPRESSION> and get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14602, "text": "All right, so that's what we wanted to show.", "label": []}
{"id": 14603, "text": "So let's do an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 14604, "text": "So, here's a famous example one of the most widely used distributions in practice is called the log normal.", "label": []}
{"id": 14605, "text": "And let's let <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14606, "text": "So over here, let's just compute the derivative, <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14607, "text": "And then we just need to be careful about do we multiply it by <EXPRESSION> here or <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14608, "text": "But that says <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14609, "text": "So it's the reciprocal of this, so we're gonna just put a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14610, "text": "And this is for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14611, "text": "So that's gonna be the PDF.", "label": []}
{"id": 14612, "text": "By the way if you ever forget whether this is <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> well, I mean it shouldn't take long to rederive it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14613, "text": "And you may have been taught that it's not ok to separate the <EXPRESSION> from the <EXPRESSION>, but when you go further in math then people start separating them again.", "label": []}
{"id": 14614, "text": "And as long as you're careful about what things mean it is possible to do that if you interpret it correctly, but I just think of that as an amonic.", "label": []}

{"id": 14616, "text": "Enclose both sides with an absolute value symbol.", "label": []}
{"id": 14617, "text": "All right, so I just have to tell you what this thing means.", "label": []}
{"id": 14618, "text": "So <EQUATION> = just to write it out.", "label": []}

{"id": 14620, "text": "<EXPRESSION> other calculus thing that we should discuss briefly is convolution.", "label": []}

{"id": 14623, "text": "We're assuming that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are independent here.", "label": []}

{"id": 14626, "text": "This is true.", "label": []}
{"id": 14627, "text": "And the easiest way to remember this result is by thinking by analogy, with this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14628, "text": "However, that's not a proof.", "label": []}
{"id": 14629, "text": "That's just an analogy.", "label": []}
{"id": 14630, "text": "And on the new homework, you'll see an example where if you try to reason kind of an analogous way for a product, instead of a sum, well, you'll see what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 14631, "text": "This requires more justification.", "label": []}
{"id": 14632, "text": "There are several ways to justify this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14633, "text": "Now we plug in <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14634, "text": "And once we've plugged in <EQUATION>, we can drop the condition because <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are independent.", "label": []}
{"id": 14635, "text": "So it says <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14636, "text": "Now take the derivative of both sides of this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14637, "text": "Derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then there's a theorem that says you can swap the derivative and the integral.", "label": []}

{"id": 14639, "text": "So, here's an idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 14640, "text": "So suppose we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14641, "text": "So we started last week on the big topic for the rest of the semester, optimization.", "label": []}

{"id": 14648, "text": "In other words, right angles here mean transpose <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14696, "text": "And if you're taking differential equations, it might be on an exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 14697, "text": "So it's good to learn.", "label": []}
{"id": 14698, "text": "So we'll learn about integrating factors.", "label": []}
{"id": 14699, "text": "So let's say, we have an equation that has this form.", "label": []}
{"id": 14700, "text": "Let's say this is my differential equation <EXPRESSION> I'm trying to write it neatly as possible <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14701, "text": "So, especially since we've covered this in recent videos, whenever you see an equation of this form where you have some function of <EXPRESSION>, then you have another function of <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, you said, oh, this looks like this could be an exact differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14702, "text": "And how do we test that?", "label": []}
{"id": 14703, "text": "Well, we can take the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we could call this function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14708, "text": "So, at least superficially, the way we looked at it just now, this is not an exact differential equation.", "label": []}

{"id": 14713, "text": "So let's multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14721, "text": "If you assume it's a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, it becomes a lot harder to solve for.", "label": []}
{"id": 14722, "text": "But that doesn't mean that there isn't <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14723, "text": "So let's say that <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14724, "text": "And I want to multiply it by both of these equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14725, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14726, "text": "And then, what's <EXPRESSION> times any function?", "label": []}
{"id": 14727, "text": "Well, it's just going to be <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14728, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14729, "text": "But I did multiply the right hand side times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14732, "text": "So now, if we consider this whole thing our new <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION> should be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14734, "text": "Well, if we're taking the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> here, <EXPRESSION>, which is only a function of <EXPRESSION>, it's not a function of <EXPRESSION>, it's just a constant term, right?", "label": []}

{"id": 14736, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant, or a function of <EXPRESSION> can be viewed just as a constant.", "label": []}

{"id": 14739, "text": "And what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 14740, "text": "Well, here, we'll use the product rule.", "label": []}

{"id": 14750, "text": "Times the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14778, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14785, "text": "So we could write <EQUATION>, the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14788, "text": "We're just trying to figure out the integrating factor right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14789, "text": "So let's divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14790, "text": "So we get <EXPRESSION>, this is just a separable equation now, = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14794, "text": "Multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>, you get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14795, "text": "Now, you could integrate both sides of this, and you'll get the <EQUATION>, et cetera, et cetera.", "label": []}
{"id": 14796, "text": "But it should be pretty clear from this that <EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14797, "text": "They're identical.", "label": []}
{"id": 14798, "text": "If you look at both sides of this equation there, you can just change <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>, and it becomes the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14799, "text": "So, this is obviously telling us that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14800, "text": "Or <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14801, "text": "So we have our integrating factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 14802, "text": "And if you want, you can take the antiderivative of both sides with the natural logs, and all of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14803, "text": "And you'll get the same answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14804, "text": "But this is just, by looking at it, by inspection, you know that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14805, "text": "Because both sides of this equation are completely the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 14806, "text": "Anyway, we now have our integrating factor.", "label": []}

{"id": 14831, "text": "Let's try to make sense of what you asked just a few minutes ago, what can we do directly with <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}

{"id": 14850, "text": "It doesn't work.", "label": []}

{"id": 14853, "text": "How do we express everything in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 14854, "text": "Well, we use the parametric equation.", "label": []}

{"id": 14871, "text": "I plug <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION> and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 14872, "text": "And that is the general method.", "label": []}
{"id": 14873, "text": "If you are given a curve then you first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms of the same thing?", "label": []}

{"id": 14875, "text": "You choose to parameterize your curve in whatever way you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 14876, "text": "You can choose whichever variable you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 14877, "text": "And then you could get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14878, "text": "And you would be able to do it with a lot of trig and you would get the same answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14879, "text": "That would be a harder way to get the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 14880, "text": "What you should do in practice is use the most reasonable way to parameterize your curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 14881, "text": "If you know that you have a piece of parabola <EQUATION>, there is no way you would put <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14882, "text": "You could set <EQUATION>, which is very reasonable.", "label": []}
{"id": 14883, "text": "You could even take a small shortcut and say that your variable will be just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14884, "text": "That means <EXPRESSION> you just keep as it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14885, "text": "And then, when you have <EXPRESSION>, you set <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>, and then you will have an integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14887, "text": "So, this one is not practical.", "label": []}
{"id": 14888, "text": "But you get to choose.", "label": []}
{"id": 14889, "text": "Now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 14890, "text": "We have said here is how we compute it in general, and that is the general method for computing a line integral for work.", "label": []}
{"id": 14891, "text": "You can always do this, try to find a parameter, the simplest one, express everything in terms of its variable and then you have an integral to compute.", "label": []}
{"id": 14892, "text": "But sometimes you can actually save a lot of work by just thinking geometrically about what this all does.", "label": []}
{"id": 14893, "text": "Let me tell you about the geometric approach.", "label": []}
{"id": 14894, "text": "We can write vector <EQUATION>, but that is also <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14895, "text": "Suppose we have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14896, "text": "The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14897, "text": "OK, so if I multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14898, "text": "Let's think about that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14899, "text": "I multiply by <EXPRESSION> on both the left and the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14900, "text": "Then on the left side, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14901, "text": "And on the right side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14903, "text": "And there's a very, very substantial cancellation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14904, "text": "We cancel out <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14905, "text": "And the only thing that's left is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14906, "text": "So when I subtract, I get <EXPRESSION> on the left-hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14907, "text": "And on the right-hand side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14908, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14909, "text": "And now we can rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14910, "text": "And so I've got my formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14911, "text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14912, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 14913, "text": "Now this reasoning has one flaw.", "label": []}
{"id": 14914, "text": "It's not complete.", "label": []}
{"id": 14915, "text": "And this reasoning is basically correct.", "label": []}
{"id": 14916, "text": "But it's incomplete because it requires that <EXPRESSION> exists.", "label": []}
{"id": 14917, "text": "For example, it doesn't make any sense in the case <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14918, "text": "So for example in the case <EQUATION>, we have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14919, "text": "And then when we multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14920, "text": "And now you see that the subtraction gives us <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14921, "text": "That's what's really going on in the argument in this context.", "label": []}
{"id": 14922, "text": "So it's just nonsense.", "label": []}
{"id": 14923, "text": "I mean it doesn't give us anything meaningful.", "label": []}
{"id": 14924, "text": "So this argument, it's great.", "label": []}
{"id": 14925, "text": "That <EXPRESSION> term suddenly becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14926, "text": "And the anti-derivative of this next term is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14927, "text": "And the next term is <EXPRESSION>, and so forth.", "label": []}
{"id": 14928, "text": "Yeah, question?", "label": []}
{"id": 14929, "text": "So in other words, let's plug <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14930, "text": "I'm going to add <EXPRESSION> to the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14931, "text": "And I'll plug in a <EQUATION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14932, "text": "On the other hand, I can do this for each value of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14933, "text": "So the interpretation of this is that it's a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14934, "text": "And similarly this is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14936, "text": "So there's really no distinction there, it's just I slipped it passed you.", "label": []}
{"id": 14937, "text": "These are functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14938, "text": "And the notion of a power series is this idea that you put coefficients on a series, but then you allow yourself the flexibility to stick powers here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14939, "text": "And that's exactly what we're doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 14940, "text": "OK there are other kinds of series where you stick other interesting functions in here like sines and cosines.", "label": []}
{"id": 14941, "text": "There are lots of other series that people study.", "label": []}
{"id": 14942, "text": "And these are the simplest ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 14943, "text": "And all those examples are extremely helpful for representing functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14944, "text": "But we're only going to do this example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14945, "text": "All right, so here are the <EXPRESSION> rules.", "label": []}
{"id": 14946, "text": "And now there's only one other complication here which I have to explain to you before giving you a bunch of examples to show you that this works extremely well.", "label": []}
{"id": 14947, "text": "Namely, Differentiate <EXPRESSION> times.", "label": []}
{"id": 14948, "text": "And you evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14949, "text": "And you divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14950, "text": "And multiply by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14951, "text": "So let's just illustrate it <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14952, "text": "But now you see if I plug in <EQUATION>, I can pick off the <EXPRESSION> term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14953, "text": "And I evaluate <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14954, "text": "So set all of those numerators to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14955, "text": "So this will actually make it easier for you to remember, rather than harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 14956, "text": "And so with that, I'll leave the practice on differentiation for next time.", "label": []}
{"id": 14957, "text": "And good luck, everybody.", "label": []}
{"id": 14958, "text": "I'll talk to you individually.", "label": []}
{"id": 14959, "text": "Let's say that we have passed the test.", "label": []}

{"id": 14964, "text": "Let's say I want to do it for this vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 14965, "text": "I will set <EQUATION> and also <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14972, "text": "We want to solve the equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14973, "text": "We want a function such that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14974, "text": "Let's just look at one of these at a time.", "label": []}
{"id": 14975, "text": "If we look at this one, well, we know how to solve this because it is just telling us we have to integrate this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14976, "text": "Well, let's call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> because I will have to refer to them again.", "label": []}
{"id": 14977, "text": "Let's start with equation <EXPRESSION> and lets integrate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14978, "text": "And that is not quite the end to it because there is an integration constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14979, "text": "And here, when I say there is an integration constant, it just means the extra term does not depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14980, "text": "That is what it means to be a constant in this setting.", "label": []}
{"id": 14981, "text": "But maybe my constant still depends on y so it is not actually a true constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14982, "text": "A constant that depends on <EXPRESSION> is not really a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14983, "text": "It is actually a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14984, "text": "The good news that we have is that this function normally depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14985, "text": "We have made some progress.", "label": []}
{"id": 14986, "text": "We have part of the answer and we have simplified the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 14987, "text": "If we have anything that looks like this, it will satisfy the first condition.", "label": []}

{"id": 14989, "text": "We want <EXPRESSION> to be that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14990, "text": "But we know what <EXPRESSION> is, so let's compute <EXPRESSION> from this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14991, "text": "From this I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14992, "text": "What do I get if I differentiate this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}

{"id": 14996, "text": "If we compare the two things there, we get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14997, "text": "And, of course, the <EXPRESSION> go away.", "label": []}
{"id": 14998, "text": "That tells you <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14999, "text": "And that integrates to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15000, "text": "Now, this time the constant is a true constant because g did not depend on anything other than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15001, "text": "And the constant does not depend on <EXPRESSION> so it is a real constant now.", "label": []}
{"id": 15002, "text": "Now we just plug <EQUATION> back into this guy.", "label": []}

{"id": 15006, "text": "You will get another expression for f up to a constant that depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15007, "text": "And then let's match them.", "label": []}
{"id": 15008, "text": "Well, the difficulty is matching is actually quite tricky because you don't know in advance whether they will be the same expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 15009, "text": "That is actually not a good way to do it, because if I put sufficiently complicated trig functions in there then you might not be able to see that two terms are the same.", "label": []}

{"id": 15017, "text": "By the way, here, of course, after we simplified there were only <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}

{"id": 15025, "text": "Who prefers the first method?", "label": []}
{"id": 15032, "text": "On the other hand, it does require a little bit more attention.", "label": []}
{"id": 15033, "text": "Let's move on a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 15034, "text": "Let me start by actually doing a small recap.", "label": []}
{"id": 15035, "text": "Take the double integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15036, "text": "We've seen various formulas for how to set up the double integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15038, "text": "So, let's say that the coordinates of my vector field are, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15039, "text": "OK, so the first thing we need to do is actually a simplification.", "label": []}
{"id": 15040, "text": "So, let's simplify <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15041, "text": "So, instead of proving the divergence theorem, namely, the equality up there, I'm going to actually prove something easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 15042, "text": "So let me change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15043, "text": "If you already have an <EXPRESSION>, I mean, there's not much risk for confusion, but still.", "label": []}
{"id": 15044, "text": "OK, so we're going to call <EXPRESSION> the shadow of my region instead.", "label": []}
{"id": 15045, "text": "So, I can't actually set up bounds for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15046, "text": "But, I'm going to just leave it like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15047, "text": "So, you should get <EXPRESSION> back.", "label": []}
{"id": 15048, "text": "OK, so let's take the triple integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15049, "text": "So, that means, remember, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15050, "text": "And, in fact, I will plug <EXPRESSION> into <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15051, "text": "OK, any questions about this?", "label": []}
{"id": 15052, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 15053, "text": "Is it looking vaguely believable?", "label": []}
{"id": 15054, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 15055, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 15056, "text": "We won't be able to do anything else.", "label": []}
{"id": 15057, "text": "Then, I integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15058, "text": "And, what's the range for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15059, "text": "So, we should be able to get <EXPRESSION> using the same method, negative partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, negative partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15060, "text": "Now, there's a small catch.", "label": []}
{"id": 15061, "text": "OK, we have to think of it carefully about orientations.", "label": []}
{"id": 15062, "text": "But, on the bottom face, we want <EXPRESSION> pointing down.", "label": []}
{"id": 15063, "text": "Invert the signs in the left side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15064, "text": "And let's say that we have a curve <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15065, "text": "Let's say that I give you <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15066, "text": "And let's say that we have <EQUATION> <EQUATION> <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15067, "text": "Let me write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15068, "text": "Plug <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15069, "text": "We need <EXPRESSION> conditions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15070, "text": "Let's do it in order.", "label": []}
{"id": 15071, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15072, "text": "And we have <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15073, "text": "How do you remember these three conditions?", "label": []}
{"id": 15074, "text": "Well, it is pretty easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 15075, "text": "In fact, if you had a function of many more variables the criterion would still look exactly like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15076, "text": "For every pair of components the mixed partials must be the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 15078, "text": "This you need to know so let me box it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15079, "text": "That is pretty straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 15080, "text": "Let's do an example just to see how it goes.", "label": []}
{"id": 15081, "text": "By the way, we can also think of it in terms of differentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 15082, "text": "Before I do the example, let me just say we have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15083, "text": "That is the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 15084, "text": "Just in the language of differentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 15085, "text": "The example that I promised.", "label": []}
{"id": 15086, "text": "Of course, I could do again the same <EXPRESSION> over there and check that it satisfies the condition, but then it wouldn't be much fun.", "label": []}
{"id": 15087, "text": "So let's do a better <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15088, "text": "Actually, let's do it in a way that looks like an exam problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 15089, "text": "Let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15090, "text": "But it will fit here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15091, "text": "Let's do it <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15092, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15093, "text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15094, "text": "That seems to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15095, "text": "What is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15096, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15097, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 15098, "text": "Actually, let me write them down <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15099, "text": "Because otherwise I am going to get confused myself.", "label": []}
{"id": 15100, "text": "The other one has actually more steps.", "label": []}
{"id": 15101, "text": "I mean, of course, here there are also a bit more steps because you have <EXPRESSION> parts to your path instead of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15102, "text": "We are going to look at them one at a time and get partial information on the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15103, "text": "And then we will compare with the others to get more information until we are completely done.", "label": []}
{"id": 15104, "text": "The first thing we will do, we know that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15105, "text": "That should tell us something about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15106, "text": "Well, let's just integrate that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15107, "text": "Let me write integral <EXPRESSION> next to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15111, "text": "It means that for given values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> we will get a term that does not depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15112, "text": "It still depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15113, "text": "In fact, what we get is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15114, "text": "See, if you took the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> you will get <EXPRESSION> and this guy will go away because there is no <EXPRESSION> in it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15115, "text": "That is the first step.", "label": []}
{"id": 15116, "text": "Now we need to get some information on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15117, "text": "How do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 15118, "text": "Now, let's integrate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15119, "text": "Well, let's write <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15120, "text": "You start with <EXPRESSION> and you integrate that with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15121, "text": "That gives you <EXPRESSION> up to a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> only.", "label": []}
{"id": 15122, "text": "You can choose whichever <EXPRESSION> you prefer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15123, "text": "I would encourage you to get some practice by trying both on least a couple of examples just to make sure that you know how to do them both and then stick to whichever one you prefer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15124, "text": "Any questions on that?", "label": []}
{"id": 15125, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 15126, "text": "I guess I already asked.", "label": []}
{"id": 15127, "text": "Still no questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 15128, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 15129, "text": "Then we define <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15130, "text": "And of course nobody can remember this formula, so what is the structure of this formula?", "label": []}
{"id": 15131, "text": "And, in general, if you have a complicated motion some of it might be, you know, there is a translation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15132, "text": "And then within that translation there is maybe expansion and rotation and sharing and everything.", "label": []}
{"id": 15133, "text": "And the curl will compute how much rotation is taking place.", "label": []}
{"id": 15134, "text": "It will tell you, say that you have a very small solid, I don't know like a ping pong ball in your flow, and it is just going with the flow, it tells you how it is going to start rotating.", "label": []}
{"id": 15135, "text": "That is what curl measures.", "label": []}
{"id": 15136, "text": "On Thursday we will see Stokes' theorem, which will be the last ingredient before the next exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 15137, "text": "And then on Friday we will review stuff.", "label": []}
{"id": 15138, "text": "Now, today I need to get started by finishing up what I did last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 15139, "text": "Namely, talking about numerical methods.", "label": []}
{"id": 15140, "text": "And I want to just carry out <EXPRESSION> example.", "label": []}
{"id": 15141, "text": "And then I want to fill in <EXPRESSION> loose end.", "label": []}
{"id": 15142, "text": "And then we'll talk about the unit overall.", "label": []}
{"id": 15143, "text": "We were talking, last time, about numerical integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 15144, "text": "I'm going to illustrate this just with the simplest example that I can.", "label": []}
{"id": 15145, "text": "We're going to look at the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15146, "text": "Which we know perfectly well already is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15147, "text": "Now, if you punch that into your calculator, you're going to get something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15148, "text": "I hope I saved it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15149, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 15150, "text": "It's about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15151, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15152, "text": "That's more digits than we're going to get in our discussion here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15153, "text": "Anyway, that's about how big this number is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15154, "text": "And the numerical integration methods will give you about as much accuracy as you can get on the function itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 15155, "text": "And, of course, some functions we may have more trouble approximating.", "label": []}
{"id": 15156, "text": "But the function <EXPRESSION>, we know pretty well how to do, because we know how to divide.", "label": []}
{"id": 15157, "text": "So since the function that we're integrating here is <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be not too difficult to get some arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 15158, "text": "Nevertheless, I'm going to do this in the simplest possible case.", "label": []}
{"id": 15159, "text": "Namely, just with <EXPRESSION> intervals.", "label": []}
{"id": 15160, "text": "Now, you really can't expect things to work so well with <EXPRESSION> intervals.", "label": []}
{"id": 15161, "text": "That's a pretty ridiculous approximation to your function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15162, "text": "When you have <EXPRESSION> intervals, that means you're looking at the graph of this hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 15163, "text": "And you have <EXPRESSION> here, and you have <EXPRESSION> here and you have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15164, "text": "And you're really only keeping track of the values at these <EXPRESSION> spots.", "label": []}
{"id": 15165, "text": "So the idea that you can approximate the area just by knowing the values of <EXPRESSION> places is a little bit of a stretch of the imagination.", "label": []}
{"id": 15166, "text": "Which is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15167, "text": "It seems very modest, but if it doesn't give you the exact answer for <EQUATION>, you've got the wrong weightings.", "label": []}
{"id": 15168, "text": "We integrate the whole range from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15169, "text": "And we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15170, "text": "So the conclusion is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15171, "text": "We already know that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15172, "text": "Now, the problem that we want to deal with now is the problem not of a volume, but an area.", "label": []}
{"id": 15173, "text": "And this looks quite different.", "label": []}
{"id": 15174, "text": "And of course the answer is going to be different.", "label": []}
{"id": 15175, "text": "But let's do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15176, "text": "We want to say <EQUATION>, which we already know is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15177, "text": "And so <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15178, "text": "The idea here is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15179, "text": "This number here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15180, "text": "And so <EQUATION>, if we believe what we said on the last panel.", "label": []}
{"id": 15181, "text": "And that was the thing that I drew a picture of on the board.", "label": []}
{"id": 15182, "text": "Namely, the graph of <EXPRESSION> looked like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15183, "text": "And there was this asymptote, which was the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15184, "text": "What's in that orange box there, that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15185, "text": "Now, I draw the graph of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15186, "text": "This will be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15187, "text": "Some other level.", "label": []}
{"id": 15188, "text": "And now I'm going to show you what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 15189, "text": "What happens is that the hump dies down a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 15190, "text": "So the bump is just a little bit lower.", "label": []}
{"id": 15191, "text": "And it's going to look a little bit the same way.", "label": []}
{"id": 15192, "text": "But it's just going to be a bit smaller.", "label": []}
{"id": 15193, "text": "So there's another slice here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15194, "text": "Like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15195, "text": "And let's just substitute <EQUATION> in.", "label": []}
{"id": 15196, "text": "So we know what gamma is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15197, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15198, "text": "You integrate the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15199, "text": "So what is it really doing?", "label": []}
{"id": 15200, "text": "Let's say that I had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation: the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15201, "text": "So you might say, wow, this is a tremendously complicated problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 15202, "text": "I have the <EXPRESSION> types of functions I've been exposed to, I would have so many undetermined coefficients, it would get really unwieldy.", "label": []}
{"id": 15203, "text": "And this is where you need to make a simplifying realization.", "label": []}
{"id": 15204, "text": "We know the <EXPRESSION> particular solutions to the following differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 15206, "text": "We know the solution to this one, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15207, "text": "This was another particular solution we found.", "label": []}
{"id": 15208, "text": "I think it was <EXPRESSION> videos ago.", "label": []}
{"id": 15209, "text": "And we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15210, "text": "Sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 15211, "text": "The particular solution was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15212, "text": "And then finally this last polynomial, we could call it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15213, "text": "We know the solution when that was just the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15214, "text": "That was this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15215, "text": "And there we figured out and this was in the last video.", "label": []}
{"id": 15216, "text": "So we know the particular solution when <EXPRESSION> on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15217, "text": "We know it when just <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15218, "text": "We know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15219, "text": "And we know it just when <EXPRESSION> is on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15220, "text": "First of all, the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation, we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15221, "text": "And that makes sense, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 15222, "text": "Because one of the particular solutions, like this one when you put it on the left hand side, it will just = this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 15223, "text": "This particular solution, when you put it in the left hand side, will = this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 15224, "text": "Set the left hand side to = the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15225, "text": "And then you could add the homogeneous solution to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15226, "text": "You put it in the left side and you'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15227, "text": "So it won't change the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15228, "text": "And then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition.", "label": []}
{"id": 15229, "text": "So the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15230, "text": "Let me clean up some space because I want everything to be on the board at the same time.", "label": []}
{"id": 15231, "text": "So the solution is going to be well, I want that to be deleted.", "label": []}
{"id": 15232, "text": "I'll do it in baby blue.", "label": []}
{"id": 15233, "text": "And then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation, if this was a 0 on the right hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15234, "text": "And then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.", "label": []}
{"id": 15235, "text": "See you in the next video, where we'll start learning another method for solving nonhomogeneous equations.", "label": []}

{"id": 1921, "text": "And this bottom function, right here, that is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1922, "text": "So integrate from <EXPRESSION>, from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1923, "text": "So the expression, let me move it down a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 1924, "text": "So what is the area of each of these squares? Each of these cross-sections, what is the area? Well the base is going to be the difference between our two functions, right? This top function right here, that was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1925, "text": "So we were doing part c of the first problem on the Calculus BC exam, the free response part, and so what, I'll re-read it, it says the region r, this is the region r, is the base of a solid.", "label": []}
{"id": 1926, "text": "So what does part d say? The region r models the surface of a small pond, so that's the surface now.", "label": []}
{"id": 1927, "text": "This is the polynomial function below it.", "label": []}
{"id": 1928, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1929, "text": "And if we were to sum up all of these infinitely thin solids, we would get the volume for the whole thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 1930, "text": "Same thing here.", "label": []}
{"id": 1931, "text": "Let's see what it ends up with.", "label": []}
{"id": 1932, "text": "So since they said that a graphing calculator is required for some parts of the problem, I say why not use our graphing calculator? Because the graphing calculator is very good at numerically evaluating definite integrals like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 1933, "text": "So here, the height will be really high, because this is kind of maybe our maximum point in terms of the base width.", "label": []}
{"id": 1934, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1935, "text": "And then what are our boundaries of integration? Well it's the same thing as in part a.", "label": []}
{"id": 1936, "text": "OK, so I wanted to make this a little smaller.", "label": []}
{"id": 1937, "text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1938, "text": "that's the answer, that is the volume of this solid it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1939, "text": "So they say, each cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis is a square.", "label": []}
{"id": 1940, "text": "And the pond essentially gets shallower and shallower as we go to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 1941, "text": "I know that's kind of hard to visualize.", "label": []}
{"id": 1942, "text": "So let's do part d.", "label": []}
{"id": 1943, "text": "And then this definite integral function, you have to tell it which is the independent variable, or kind of, you know, what variable are we integrating across, and that's the variable x.", "label": []}
{"id": 1944, "text": "So it says for this solid, each cross section perpendicular to the x-axis, right? There's two ways you can do a cross-section, you could do them, you could cut this way, but that would be parallel to the x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 1945, "text": "But anyway, how do we figure out what the volume of this lake is? But actually, I realize I'm pushing nine minutes, so I will continue this in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 1946, "text": "So if we take the cross-section just along the x-axis, the depth is going to look something like this, but then this is the top of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 1947, "text": "But anyway, what we do is, we take the area of each of these squares, and I drew one of them here.", "label": []}
{"id": 1948, "text": "And I'm pretty sure they want you to use a calculator, because frankly, computing the integral, that's kind of just chug math, you know, very mechanical math, although it's pretty sophisticated, but it would take you forever.", "label": []}
{"id": 1949, "text": "So what's the area? It's going to be this <EXPRESSION>, so we have to square this entire thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 1950, "text": "OK, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1951, "text": "And at this point, the depth is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 1954, "text": "And then you just tell it the boundaries of integration, and we're done.", "label": []}
{"id": 1955, "text": "I redrew the region r here, but with a little perspective, so we can hopefully visualize it in three dimensions.", "label": []}
{"id": 1956, "text": "You could almost imagine it, let me see if I can draw it again.", "label": []}
{"id": 1957, "text": "<EXPRESSION> So you could write that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1958, "text": "So essentially <EXPRESSION> is the depth, right? So at this point of this pond, the depth is just <EXPRESSION>, right <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 1960, "text": "Press F5, definite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 1961, "text": "So we essentially just have to evaluate this now.", "label": []}
{"id": 1962, "text": "So that's the area of each of these squares, and then we have to multiply them times a little bit of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1963, "text": "So here, this would be the base, and since we know the cross-section is the square, the height has to be the same length as the base.", "label": []}
{"id": 1964, "text": "And so here, the depth of the pond is given by the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1965, "text": "And this function right here, this is definite integral, a very useful function to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 1966, "text": "And then you integrate that from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1967, "text": "You take you each of the area of each of these squares, multiply them by a super small change in <EXPRESSION>, and that we know, from everything we've learned in calculus hopefully, that that super small change in <EXPRESSION>, I'm trying to draw a little perspective, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1968, "text": "This is, it's probably drawn in, that's the x-axis.", "label": []}

{"id": 1971, "text": "And it's in some ways you easier to visualize it than it is to draw, so you have to give me some credit.", "label": []}
{"id": 1972, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1973, "text": "So it's open parentheses sin of where is pi? Pi is I haven't used one of these calculators in a long, long time oh there it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 1974, "text": "This is the y-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 1975, "text": "So far this might look pretty similar to part a, but what's the twist here? We want the area.", "label": []}
{"id": 1976, "text": "Second <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1977, "text": "But it's still pretty wide, then it gets narrow again.", "label": []}
{"id": 1978, "text": "So this is the sin function with some perspective.", "label": []}
{"id": 1979, "text": "So if we multiply <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, that is the volume of this kind of part the entire solid.", "label": []}
{"id": 1980, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 1981, "text": "We wanted to cut perpendicular to the x-axis, or parallel to the y-axis, right? So if we cut it along the line like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 1982, "text": "So how do we do that? Well let's write our integral expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 1983, "text": "So I drew a couple of squares here.", "label": []}
{"id": 1984, "text": "So over here, the depth is <EXPRESSION>, so if I were to draw, so if I were to go straight down the depth is, you know maybe it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 1986, "text": "If I haven't made a mistake, I can hit enter, and let the calculator do the rest of the work.", "label": []}
{"id": 1987, "text": "So here the depth is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 2116, "text": "So the volume this time, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2117, "text": "And so to find the volume, we think about it the same way.", "label": []}
{"id": 2118, "text": "So let's do second insert.", "label": []}
{"id": 2119, "text": "So the height along the surface of the pond is going to be the difference between the two functions.", "label": []}

{"id": 2129, "text": "And it noticed, it is calculating.", "label": []}
{"id": 2130, "text": "So we know this the height, sorry, the width along the surface of this cross section is going to be the difference between this function and this function, right?

{"id": 2131, "text": "So this was part c that we already have in our calculator.", "label": []}

{"id": 2831, "text": "I don't want to scale it anymore.", "label": []}
{"id": 2832, "text": "Because even though we're applying it to a three-dimensional surface, but then you can do the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2833, "text": "Another way to think about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 2834, "text": "So what does that look like? Well what are each of the components of this vector? What is <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction? What does that vector look like? What is <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction look like? And this I have graphed.", "label": []}
{"id": 2835, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2836, "text": "This parallel to this line is the vector in the x-axis, right? So at this point I've actually calculated the gradient.", "label": []}

{"id": 2838, "text": "Maybe it's more clear if we look from below the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 2839, "text": "So let me zoom out a little bit because I want you to see the actual axes There's the axes So all this says if I were to go in this direction, I get the maximum slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 2840, "text": "And obviously if there's a function of more variables you could keep going and you'd multiply the magnitude of the derivative in each of those dimension's directions times the unit vector in that dimension.", "label": []}
{"id": 2841, "text": "And I can rotate this.", "label": []}
{"id": 2842, "text": "But if I would have traveled this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, then I will get the maximum increase in <EXPRESSION> per unit that I travel.", "label": []}
{"id": 2843, "text": "And we saw there was some symmetry, so the magnitude of this vector is the same as the magnitude of this vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2844, "text": "So the gradient of our particular function, it's a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2845, "text": "And it's direction, it just goes in the <EXPRESSION> direction, because it's that times the <EXPRESSION> unit vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2846, "text": "And I want you to think about it a little bit more.", "label": []}
{"id": 2847, "text": "Now this is the y direction, or the same direction as the <EXPRESSION> unit vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2848, "text": "So I need to travel a little bit more in the <EXPRESSION> direction, and I'll get the maximum change in <EXPRESSION> if I travel there.", "label": []}
{"id": 2849, "text": "And we multiply that in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2850, "text": "And you'll see what I mean.", "label": []}
{"id": 2851, "text": "If I go in that direction I get a maximum upward slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 2852, "text": "You can extend this to any dimension.", "label": []}
{"id": 2853, "text": "And then you could extend it to <EXPRESSION> dimensions, but it becomes very hard to visualize.", "label": []}
{"id": 2854, "text": "So the gradient that we use this vector differential operator this upside down triangle the gradient of <EQUATION> which is the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction so it gives the magnitude of the slope and the <EXPRESSION> direction, and then it points the vector in that direction plus the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2855, "text": "So we figure that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 2856, "text": "And why is that interesting? Well the gradient and this is the intuition the gradient tells you the direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane you should travel in order to get the maximum slope in the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "label": []}
{"id": 2857, "text": "So this is the same surface we've been working with, but now I've plotted these points right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 2858, "text": "The plane defined by all of these vectors is all flat in the <EXPRESSION> dimension.", "label": []}
{"id": 2859, "text": "And then when you add them together, you get the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 2860, "text": "And let's actually show you what it looks like in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 2861, "text": "And we multiply that in the <EXPRESSION> direction, or in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2862, "text": "If I'm here notice here the <EXPRESSION> component of the gradient is much larger than the <EXPRESSION> component.", "label": []}

{"id": 2864, "text": "We're going to take the gradient in two-dimensional space, and you'll see what that means in a second.", "label": []}
{"id": 2865, "text": "So if I just go head on so I'm above the graph looking straight down at the graph, and then the colors just show kind of you know where we are if I travel in this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, I get my maximum increase in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2866, "text": "Well what does this mean? And another way to view it, you could have also written this as the gradient of <EQUATION> and then all of that in the i direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2867, "text": "Not times, operated on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2868, "text": "Zoom in, there you go.", "label": []}
{"id": 2869, "text": "So if I go in this direction, my <EXPRESSION> goes up like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 2870, "text": "And I wanted to see the axes, which you can't see now that I'm zoomed in, but you took my word this was the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2871, "text": "Let me see if I can actually zoom in a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 2872, "text": "And the gradient says, well, if I travel in this direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane notice that none of these have any <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2873, "text": "I think that's pretty neat.", "label": []}
{"id": 2874, "text": "Similarly, this vector right here I hope you can see it.", "label": []}
{"id": 2875, "text": "But in my opinion at least the intuition is a little bit harder to get your head around than the actual mechanics, but once you get it, it makes a lot of sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 2876, "text": "Plus the partial with respect to y, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2877, "text": "Let's actually calculate the gradient of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2878, "text": "And if you were to take any closed line where the <EXPRESSION> is constant well actually I don't want to get into that too much, but this gradient will actually be normal to any, or it'll be perpendicular to any curve where <EXPRESSION> is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 2879, "text": "And that's the magnitude.", "label": []}
{"id": 2880, "text": "Actually it becomes hard to visualize beyond what we're doing right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 2881, "text": "So what does this mean? Well before I go into what it means, let's actually calculate it for this and then I'll show you what it means.", "label": []}
{"id": 2882, "text": "So this vector is the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 2883, "text": "And then when you add the two vectors together, you get this vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2884, "text": "And then if you wanted to do it into three space that's not going to apply to our problem because we only care about two dimensions right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 2885, "text": "The partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> said what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}

{"id": 2897, "text": "Now we're going to take the gradient of this, and then I'll give you a little bit of intuition on what a gradient is.", "label": []}
{"id": 2898, "text": "That's what the gradient tells you, how do you get the maximum upward slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 2899, "text": "And then I can spin it around.", "label": []}
{"id": 2900, "text": "And because of this notation, a lot of people view this delta operator and actually it's pretty consistent when we learn about the divergence and the curl a lot of people view this delta operator, they actually define it.", "label": []}
{"id": 2901, "text": "But you could take the partial derivative with respect to any direction, and the gradient gives you the direction in which the slope is the largest.", "label": []}
{"id": 2902, "text": "So if I go in that direction in the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> plane, I get maximum <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2903, "text": "Remember the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> said what is the slope in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2904, "text": "And we calculated this in the two videos on the partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 2905, "text": "That's the partial of this function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 2919, "text": "So let's say that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2920, "text": "And the magnitude is determined by the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "label": []}

{"id": 2937, "text": "If you wanted to know the gradient at any point in space, you would substitute an <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 2938, "text": "And let me make it bigger so we can explore it a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 2939, "text": "So the radius away from the center, that's just going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2940, "text": "Well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 2944, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2945, "text": "So what's the radial distance away? And this actually isn't that relevant to learning gradients, but let's get a little intuition about what that actual temperature function how it actually changes as you go through the room.", "label": []}
{"id": 2946, "text": "Let me erase this thing down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 2947, "text": "Let's say we have a <EXPRESSION> kelvin heat force in the center of our room.", "label": []}
{"id": 2948, "text": "So let's say that the temperature function.", "label": []}
{"id": 2949, "text": "And then all of that times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2950, "text": "So what would happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 2951, "text": "Now let's try to get our heads around what the gradient of a function of three variables looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 2952, "text": "Let's actually fly in to the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2953, "text": "And then all of that times the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2954, "text": "The harder part is the intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 2955, "text": "As you get closer and closer to our heat source, the rate at which the temperature increases, increases! Right? The vectors as you get closer, get bigger and bigger.", "label": []}
{"id": 2956, "text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION>, the temperature at any point, was a scalar field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2957, "text": "In the last video we had a three-dimensional surface, where the height <EXPRESSION> was a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2958, "text": "When I first learned gradients, I think the computation is relatively straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 2959, "text": "And I'm going to switch from this blue color, because it's a little nauseating.", "label": []}
{"id": 2960, "text": "And then the derivative of the whole thing is just itself again.", "label": []}
{"id": 2961, "text": "Where the magnitude are the partial derivatives, and then the direction is given by <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2962, "text": "Oh, I have an e to this three variable function, how do I take the partial derivative? Remember, if you're taking the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> you just pretend like the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> are constants.", "label": []}
{"id": 2963, "text": "You wouldn't get a temperature and a direction, so it's not a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2964, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2965, "text": "The partial derivative of this inner function with respect to <EXPRESSION>, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2966, "text": "But the intuition is always the interesting thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 2967, "text": "So the derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2968, "text": "Kind of radially further and further away from that source.", "label": []}
{"id": 2969, "text": "And also, the magnitude of those vectors in that vector field will tell us how large of an increase in temperature we are looking at.", "label": []}
{"id": 2970, "text": "And now we just plug and chug and figure out the partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 2971, "text": "And let's say that center of the room is at the coordinates <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2972, "text": "This is just the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 2973, "text": "And hopefully this temperature analogy and not even analogy this temperature model will make a little sense to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 2974, "text": "But anyway, the more important thing is I always find with gradients it's easy to calculate them, but the intuition oh sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 2975, "text": "And let me zoom in.", "label": []}
{"id": 2976, "text": "So we're now within the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2977, "text": "So you could write it as the gradient function is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2978, "text": "It's just partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 2979, "text": "But it applies to pretty much any scalar field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2980, "text": "That's why <EXPRESSION> is such an amazing number.", "label": []}
{"id": 2981, "text": "And that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 2983, "text": "At any point in three dimensions it just gave you a number.", "label": []}
{"id": 2984, "text": "And actually, I'm not going to go into that, because I realize I'm running out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 2985, "text": "And then the direction is given by the relative weighting of the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "label": []}
{"id": 2986, "text": "So plus what's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well it's going to look very similar.", "label": []}
{"id": 2987, "text": "And then you add them together like you would add any vectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 2988, "text": "Now when you have the gradient, at any point in three dimensions it gives you a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 2989, "text": "This is also included.", "label": []}
{"id": 2990, "text": "So the easiest one for me to imagine is a scalar field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2991, "text": "That's just the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.", "label": []}
{"id": 2992, "text": "So it'd be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2993, "text": "So times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2994, "text": "So this is the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 2995, "text": "Right? And now we can do the same thing for the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 2996, "text": "Right? <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2997, "text": "Well I'm just saying that it exponentially decays as you get further and further away from that source.", "label": []}
{"id": 2998, "text": "Instead of <EXPRESSION>, I wrote <EXPRESSION>, just to kind of give you the intuition that this expression is just saying the square of the distance as we get away from the center of our room, or from the coordinate <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 2999, "text": "I think you can simplify this algebraically.", "label": []}
{"id": 3000, "text": "And I don't know, I have never actually modeled temperature.", "label": []}
{"id": 3001, "text": "And it gave us surface in three-dimensional space.", "label": []}
{"id": 3002, "text": "So let's get an intuition of what this gradient function will actually look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 3003, "text": "I think that's pretty good.", "label": []}
{"id": 3004, "text": "So let's write temperature as a function of <EQUATION> which is exactly what I wrote up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3005, "text": "Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse you.", "label": []}
{"id": 3006, "text": "And then finally, the partial derivative of the temperature function with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3007, "text": "So let's say our temperature function I'm just making this up, I don't know if this is an accurate model of temperature it's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3008, "text": "And that's why it's called a scalar field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3009, "text": "I can imagine as you go further and further away from that heat source it's going to get colder and colder.", "label": []}
{"id": 3010, "text": "So let's take the derivative of the inside function.", "label": []}
{"id": 3011, "text": "So we've gone from having a scalar field to a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3012, "text": "So let's compute the gradient, and then I'll show you a diagram that might make things a little bit more intuitive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3013, "text": "Now why did I say r? I said it's a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3014, "text": "But let's say I have, I don't know, a <EXPRESSION> kelvin actually, let me make it so that our vector field works out right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3015, "text": "And as you can see, at any point and when this graphing program that did it, it just picked different points and it calculated the gradients at that point, and then it graphed them as vectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 3016, "text": "And then all of that times the unit vector in the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3017, "text": "That's the way I view it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3018, "text": "And you can see as we get closer and closer to the center of our heat source, the vectors, the rate at which the temperature increases, gets bigger and bigger and bigger.", "label": []}
{"id": 3019, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3020, "text": "Right? Because it has <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "label": []}
{"id": 3021, "text": "This is a <EXPRESSION> right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3022, "text": "So the length of the vectors are just the magnitudes of the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "label": []}
{"id": 3023, "text": "But I want you to understand, at least conceptualize this, it's hard to draw a scalar field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3024, "text": "So the gradient of <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3025, "text": "So you could distribute this minus if you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 3026, "text": "You could have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3027, "text": "And we could simplify this a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3028, "text": "If you were to take a thermometer and measure any point in space in the room that you're in right now, you would get a temperature.", "label": []}
{"id": 3029, "text": "Let me write it up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3030, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> here, this is just a constant that when you take the derivative of a constant times something the constant carries over.", "label": []}
{"id": 3031, "text": "So the gradient of the temperature function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3032, "text": "And I'm treating the other two variables that I'm not taking the partial derivative with respect to, as constants.", "label": []}
{"id": 3033, "text": "And as you can see, the intuition is pretty interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 3034, "text": "But a common mnemonic to remember the operation of diverge and is to write the upside down triangle, which was the same notation we used for gradient, but take the dot product of that and the vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3035, "text": "If I have a particle here, it's velocity in the x-direction is going to be <EXPRESSION> to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3036, "text": "When you take the divergence of something, you're going in the opposite direction, in some ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 3037, "text": "And when <EQUATION> I could have picked any points, but I'm just picking the numbers that's easy to calculate when <EQUATION>, what is the magnitude of the vector? It's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3038, "text": "Or we can even, let's do it in two dimensions, but I'll make it constant in the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3039, "text": "And then its velocity in the y-direction, I don't know maybe it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3040, "text": "You start with the vector field, right? And what's a factor field? It's something that if you give me any point <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, I'll give you a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3041, "text": "And then if we went to three dimensions, the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and the k-direction, et cetera, et cetera.", "label": []}
{"id": 3042, "text": "Well, what's the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? If <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, <EXPRESSION> is just a number.", "label": []}
{"id": 3043, "text": "OK, oh, I didn't want to do that dot.", "label": []}
{"id": 3044, "text": "So for any <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of the vector doesn't change, right? It's only dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3045, "text": "So it's going to be twice as big.", "label": []}
{"id": 3046, "text": "So its velocity in the x-direction is actually a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3047, "text": "Let me do it in one dimension.", "label": []}
{"id": 3048, "text": "And let's say this vector field, just for the purposes of visualization it could be anything, but let's say it represents the velocity of particles of fluid of any point in two dimensions.", "label": []}
{"id": 3049, "text": "And remember, if I have a particle right here in my fluid, if this is a particle, its velocity in the x-direction is going to be 1 meter per second to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3050, "text": "And so that is the divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3051, "text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3052, "text": "So at any point in the x-direction, at any point <EXPRESSION> comma <EXPRESSION>, its velocity in the x-direction will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3053, "text": "So this is the divergence at a point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3054, "text": "So the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> plus what's the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, you could just do <EXPRESSION>, since it's a constant, as the coefficient on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3055, "text": "The correct way to write it is the divergence of our vector field, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3056, "text": "So then oh, that's difficult because I have these <EXPRESSION> and these <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3057, "text": "And then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3058, "text": "It's going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so the velocity at any point it's a vector field let's say it is, and I'm just going to make up something.", "label": []}
{"id": 3059, "text": "So first, like I did with gradients, I'll show you the mechanics, which are actually pretty straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 3060, "text": "So there's never a y component to the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3061, "text": "And then for example, here, it'll be even longer.", "label": []}
{"id": 3062, "text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3063, "text": "What's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? We just pretended y is a constant, just a number, so the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3065, "text": "OK let's say the velocity of fluid, or the particles in fluid, at any point in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, let's say it = <EXPRESSION> plus, I don't know, <EXPRESSION> there's never any, sorry <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION> is the unit vector in the y-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3066, "text": "You just take the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> component with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and you add that to the partial derivative to the y component with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3068, "text": "And then I'll try to give you the intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3069, "text": "So let's see what divergence is.", "label": []}
{"id": 3070, "text": "So now let's try to get a little bit of intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3071, "text": "Let's say I have a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3072, "text": "So what would that look like? I don't need a computer to draw this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3073, "text": "It has no <EXPRESSION> component; ignore this right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3074, "text": "One thing to immediately realize, even before we work on the intuition, is when we did gradient I gave you a surface and it gave us a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3075, "text": "I can handle this one myself I think.", "label": []}
{"id": 3076, "text": "So let's say that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3077, "text": "But we'll see; if you just keep your head straight on what's constant and what's not, it's not too bad.", "label": []}
{"id": 3078, "text": "Or I gave you a scalar field and you got a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3079, "text": "Let's just do one more point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3080, "text": "That we just have an expression that if you give me a point anywhere in this vector field, I can tell you the divergence at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3081, "text": "So I think you'll find that the computation of divergence isn't too difficult.", "label": []}
{"id": 3082, "text": "So if you wanted to graph it, in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane you'd have a bunch of vectors, and I'll show you how that looks in a second when we go over to intuition.", "label": []}

{"id": 3089, "text": "That's its velocity in the x-direction.", "label": []}

{"id": 3096, "text": "So if I said that I had, I don't know, let's say, my vector field is <EXPRESSION> plus so it's interesting; my x-direction is dependent on my y-coordinate plus, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3098, "text": "So what would this turn out to be? If you took the dot product of this, which is this upside down triangle, with this vector field, what would you get?

{"id": 3102, "text": "But it once you get it, you're like oh, that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3103, "text": "You could almost view it as a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3104, "text": "So if that's the y-axis, that's my x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 3105, "text": "And once you have the intuition, at first it will seemed very, I don't know, unintuitive, maybe.", "label": []}
{"id": 3106, "text": "So even though a vector field has all these vectors on it, the divergence tells you an actual scalar number at any point in the field.", "label": []}

{"id": 3108, "text": "Let's try to get our heads around the idea of divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3109, "text": "So the divergence of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3110, "text": "But I'll show you why it looks like the dot product.", "label": []}

{"id": 3112, "text": "its velocity in the y-direction is just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3113, "text": "So let's get a little bit of intuition of what a divergence actually is.", "label": []}

{"id": 3131, "text": "It makes sense, right? Because if as we move to the right, and it kind of gets funky if you go into the other quadrant, so we'll stick to the first quadrant while we're trying to get our intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3132, "text": "But the classic example of a divergence is a field that looks something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3133, "text": "So where we left off I was attempting to give you the intuition of divergence and then I ran out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 3134, "text": "So clearly this area is going to become less dense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3135, "text": "So at any given point has no <EXPRESSION> component.", "label": []}
{"id": 3136, "text": "Or since we know that this is the velocity of particles, as we go in the <EXPRESSION> direction, the particles go faster and faster to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3137, "text": "It only depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3138, "text": "But even here, if I were to draw some region, the same amount is entering as exiting.", "label": []}
{"id": 3139, "text": "Well, that's also <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3140, "text": "So the further we go to the right, or the more we go to the right, the faster the particles are moving to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3141, "text": "I said OK, when <EQUATION>, the magnitude of the velocity is <EXPRESSION> maybe meters per second, if that's our unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3142, "text": "Plus the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3143, "text": "And I was drawing it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 3144, "text": "So the magnitude of the vectors, no matter what my value of <EXPRESSION>, is always going to be the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 3145, "text": "You know it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3146, "text": "And then the classic example of a divergence, although I wanted to show you that what matters is the net that's coming in to a certain area.", "label": []}
{"id": 3147, "text": "So all of the velocity is only in the <EXPRESSION> direction there is no upwards movement in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}

{"id": 3156, "text": "I'll do a fancier example in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 3157, "text": "So obviously, in any given amount of time, that point is getting more and more dense.", "label": []}

{"id": 3162, "text": "But it makes sense, because as we move to the right our particles are getting faster and faster.", "label": []}
{"id": 3163, "text": "And so the divergence I'll use this notation the divergence of our vector field is just a partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3166, "text": "The slope of how much our <EXPRESSION> component is increasing is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3167, "text": "So now let's try to get our handle on what divergence means.", "label": []}
{"id": 3168, "text": "Anyway, I've run out of time again.", "label": []}
{"id": 3169, "text": "I've never actually heard it this way, but maybe a negative divergence we view as a convergence, right? Converge is the opposite of diverge.", "label": []}
{"id": 3170, "text": "So that divergence of <EXPRESSION>, of our velocity vector field you could also view that if you want to abuse some notation, is our del vector, dot <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3171, "text": "And the classic example of a positive divergence is a point where from every direction things are leaving it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3172, "text": "So let's say my vector field is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3173, "text": "So when you have a divergence of <EXPRESSION>, that means that that part of the field is not becoming any more or less dense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3174, "text": "So here at like, say, the point <EXPRESSION>, my velocity is going to be the left <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3175, "text": "Or you could say that more is flowing out of any point than flowing in.", "label": []}
{"id": 3176, "text": "And let me clean it up a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3177, "text": "So let me draw that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3178, "text": "Vector field is always <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3179, "text": "If we're talking about velocity of particles, after any moment in time, more particles are leaving than coming in because no particles are coming in.", "label": []}
{"id": 3180, "text": "When <EQUATION>, the velocity to the right will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3181, "text": "So in any given amount of time, in my defined space, it's going to get denser and denser.", "label": []}
{"id": 3182, "text": "I will see you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 3183, "text": "So if I were to draw a region, what's happening here? Are more particles entering than leaving or leaving than entering? No.", "label": []}
{"id": 3184, "text": "It's still a constant, right? So this velocity field or vector field will look something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3185, "text": "So it's getting denser or you could almost view it as this space is sucking up particles.", "label": []}
{"id": 3186, "text": "The velocity, I'm just going to rewrite it, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3187, "text": "I think it'll start to make sense once I draw the circle.", "label": []}

{"id": 3189, "text": "And that kind of just falls out of the fact that our derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3190, "text": "And that's this example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3191, "text": "Where maybe that's the <EXPRESSION> that's the <EXPRESSION>, this is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3192, "text": "So first of all, let's take that the divergence of this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 3193, "text": "And that makes sense because the divergence of this vector field well, both of them actually, the divergence of that vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3194, "text": "And we'll just stay at a one-dimension just for the intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3195, "text": "But if we only have one dimension, so it's the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> magnitude with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3196, "text": "Let's say that the vector field = is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3197, "text": "So that divergence of this vector field at any point is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3198, "text": "At the point <EXPRESSION>, my velocity is going to be the left <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3199, "text": "So every point is getting denser and denser actually everywhere in this field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3200, "text": "It's infinitely small, but we're just trying to get some intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3201, "text": "If I have a negative divergence maybe let's define a new term.", "label": []}
{"id": 3202, "text": "And that's what a negative divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3203, "text": "Now what this tells us, what this positive divergence tells us is if we were to take let's just take an arbitrarily small circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 3204, "text": "So it's = well the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3205, "text": "So you could view a positive divergence as you could kind of say well, the field is becoming less dense at that point, or the point is a source of the field, or it's a source of particles, depending on what model you want to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 3206, "text": "For any amount that's coming in, an = amount are coming out in a certain amount of time, if we use velocity as our example.", "label": []}
{"id": 3207, "text": "And actually at every point in this field we have a negative divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3208, "text": "Now, with that said, let's take the opposite situation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3209, "text": "So now let's draw a little circle and see what's happening.", "label": []}
{"id": 3210, "text": "So the way you could think about it is in any given amount of time, what's happening? In this space, I have a few particles entering in through the left, and I have a much larger number of particle leaving through the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3211, "text": "But anyway, I had defined this fairly straightforward vector field that tells us the velocity of particles in a fluid at any given point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3212, "text": "At the velocity <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3213, "text": "The partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3214, "text": "Well, I'm having a few particles leave through the left hand side, right, but I have many more particles entering this little region that I've defined, this little circle, I'm having many more particles enter through the right in a given amount of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 3215, "text": "Another way to think of it if you have a constant vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3216, "text": "And you could have done it let me show you another.", "label": []}
{"id": 3217, "text": "As we go, increase in the <EXPRESSION> direction, the field gets stronger and stronger.", "label": []}
{"id": 3218, "text": "So here, even though some particles are leaving through the left, many more particles are coming through the right, so it's getting denser and denser.", "label": []}
{"id": 3219, "text": "So what's going to happen in this space? It's going to become less dense, right? Because in that space is going to be fewer particles after a certain amount of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 3220, "text": "It could be anywhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 3221, "text": "So as we go to the right, our velocities are going getting faster and faster, which means if we were to draw a circle anywhere, we're always going to have more exiting the right than entering through the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 3222, "text": "If my function was, let's say it = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3223, "text": "Or you could almost view it as any given point is almost a source of particles, or if you have a sphere, more particles are going to be coming out of the sphere through the right, than coming in through the sphere to the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 3224, "text": "You could almost say let's think about the word, divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3225, "text": "Let me click clear up some space.", "label": []}
{"id": 3226, "text": "So when is the <EQUATION>? Well, if we factor the <EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing as, we could rewrite our vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3227, "text": "So what's the divergence? We take the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3228, "text": "If we were to draw a circle around here, we see the vectors on the left-hand side of that circle that you can't see, because I can't draw on this graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 3229, "text": "And actually, I could zoom in a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3230, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3231, "text": "So this is the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3232, "text": "I know it's hard to see, but anywhere along the line, you see just as much entering as leaving.", "label": []}
{"id": 3233, "text": "You know what, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3234, "text": "So let's take a look at the graph and see if it if it's consistent with our intuition of what a divergence is, and the numbers we found.", "label": []}
{"id": 3235, "text": "So negative divergence, you can view it as getting denser, or it's actually converging.", "label": []}
{"id": 3236, "text": "And we see, the magnitude gets very small.", "label": []}
{"id": 3237, "text": "First of all, let's just look at the original vector field, and think about when does that vector field have some interesting points? Well, I think some interesting points are when either the <EXPRESSION> or the <EXPRESSION> are = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3238, "text": "So we said that at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, we see that in the y-direction it's actually converging, right? Above <EQUATION>, the arrows are pointing down, and below it the arrows are pointing up, right? So in the y-direction, we're actually converging, or we have a negative divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3239, "text": "They're increasing in magnitude.", "label": []}
{"id": 3240, "text": "Make it simple so that we only have one thing to factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 3241, "text": "Actually, something interesting is happening at these two points.", "label": []}
{"id": 3242, "text": "So let's try to figure out, when is the <EQUATION>? So this is divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3243, "text": "Or we could just say that the divergence of <EXPRESSION>, at any point <EXPRESSION>, so this is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3244, "text": "So it's kind of like particles are getting deflected out.", "label": []}
{"id": 3245, "text": "I think I can delete this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3246, "text": "So <EQUATION>, the divergence is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3247, "text": "And going to show you a graph of this field soon, so we'll get an intuition of what it actually looks like, instead of my not-so-accurate drawings.", "label": []}
{"id": 3248, "text": "Up here, we figure the diverge is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3249, "text": "So along this line, the divergence of the vector fields <EQUATION>, along the line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3250, "text": "There's only <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION>, so we just take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3251, "text": "And we want to know, when does that = <EXPRESSION>? So let's set it = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3252, "text": "And if we go to the bottom, if we go here on the line, it looks like maybe there are less entering, but there's also less leaving.", "label": []}
{"id": 3253, "text": "So on a net basis, between both dimensions, you have no increase or decrease in density along that line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3254, "text": "We see that the vectors entering it, the magnitude of the vectors entering it, are larger than the magnitude of the vectors exiting it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3255, "text": "And then we add that to the partial derivative of the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3256, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3257, "text": "And you could just make this a less than sign then solve, and you'll get <EQUATION>, you want to know when the divergence is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 3258, "text": "Right around here, they're all pointing inwards, , but they get smaller and smaller as you approach the point <EXPRESSION>, 1<EXPRESSION, right? We also said at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3259, "text": "At what points are, well, let's first decide, what point is <EQUATION>? Let's say, at what point is a <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3260, "text": "And so if I were to draw a boundary, more is going to be coming out of the right than entering to the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 3261, "text": "And <EQUATION>, the divergence is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 3262, "text": "If that square is my region, we see the vectors on the left-hand side are larger, than factors leaving are larger than the vectors entering it, right? So if, in a given amount of time, more is leaving than entering, then I'm becoming less dense, or you could say that the particles are diverging.", "label": []}
{"id": 3263, "text": "And that's why the divergence is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3264, "text": "And hopefully this will make everything a little bit more tangible.", "label": []}
{"id": 3265, "text": "So in any given amount of time, more is coming in than leaving.", "label": []}
{"id": 3266, "text": "We could say <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3267, "text": "But actually, let's just say the square.", "label": []}
{"id": 3268, "text": "The other point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, once again, we see the magnitude get small, and then <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3269, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, right? <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3270, "text": "Well, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and we that the magnitudes of the vectors are <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3271, "text": "So let's say that the velocity of the fluid, or the particles in the fluid, at any given point in the <EXPRESSION> plane, let's say in the x-direction, it is <EXPRESSION> in the x-direction, <EXPRESSION> in the y-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3272, "text": "So the points where they're both = <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right, because then both components are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3273, "text": "If we just factored that, that's <EXPRESSION>, and it's the same polynomial, just with , for the y-component, so <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3274, "text": "I don't have space to show it, but I think you remember, this is, you know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3275, "text": "We got our points, we figured out what coordinates are the magnitude of the vector field <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3276, "text": "So it's getting denser, or it's converging.", "label": []}
{"id": 3277, "text": "You get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3278, "text": "So that's consistent with what we found out, that the vector field gets very small at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3279, "text": "Things are entering any given spot.", "label": []}
{"id": 3280, "text": "Have it graphed here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3281, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION>, these are just the roots of this polynomial, when <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>, right? And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> when <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3282, "text": "Now, let's look at some of the other points.", "label": []}
{"id": 3283, "text": "We could be finished there, or we could just put it in our traditional <EXPRESSION> form, that's the way I find it easier to visualize a line.", "label": []}
{"id": 3284, "text": "So these are the points where the magnitude of the velocity of our fluid, or the particles of the fluid, are <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3285, "text": "Let's say at the spot, right? So it makes sense, if our partial derivatives are positive, that means that the magnitude of our vector is getting larger and larger for larger values of our <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, right? So if the magnitude of our vectors are getting larger and larger for larger values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the vectors on the right are going to have a larger magnitude than the factors on the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 3286, "text": "And does that make [UNINTELLIGIBLE] an arbitrary point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3287, "text": "And we'll see that on our graph in a second.", "label": []}
{"id": 3288, "text": "Because I can't draw on this graph, but if we drew a circle right there, let's assume that that's on that, the line <EQUATION>, we would see that in a given amount of time, just as many particles are entering through the top right as leaving through the bottom left, right? A lot of entering through the top right and a lot of leaving through the bottom left.", "label": []}
{"id": 3289, "text": "Anyway, I hope I haven't confused you too much, but I have run out of time once again.", "label": []}
{"id": 3290, "text": "So we said the divergence is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3291, "text": "So I think we've done all of the analyzing we can do.", "label": []}
{"id": 3292, "text": "This is the definition of our vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3293, "text": "Let's say the square is my region, right? This one right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3294, "text": "And before I run out of time, I just want to give you that core intuition again, of why the divergence is positive, and why that means that things are flowing out, when the rate of change is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 3295, "text": "So that's just, there's only an <EXPRESSION> here, so we don't really have to worry about keeping <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 3296, "text": "So the line <EQUATION> starts, the <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and it's going to come down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3297, "text": "And here, too, we see that the magnitude of the vectors get very, very, very small.", "label": []}
{"id": 3298, "text": "Let's figure out the divergence of our vector field, the divergence of our field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3299, "text": "But in the x-direction, things are getting pushed out, right? So the reason why the divergence is 0 here, you might have particles entering above and below a certain space, but you have just as many particles exiting to the left and the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3300, "text": "I hope you can see this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3301, "text": "And if we're above that line, the divergence is going to be positive, right, because if you just made this a greater than sign, that would carry over.", "label": []}
{"id": 3302, "text": "We could zoom in again.", "label": []}
{"id": 3303, "text": "You'd have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3304, "text": "So let's just do the math first.", "label": []}
{"id": 3305, "text": "And the vectors, though, are about the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 3306, "text": "Anyway, so the divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3307, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3308, "text": "And if we actually look at the graph, it makes sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3309, "text": "And we figured out, we just figured out when the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> are = <EXPRESSION>, and then we said, when are both of them = <EXPRESSION>? And we said, oh, well at the point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3310, "text": "We can divide both sides of the equation by <EXPRESSION>, and you get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3311, "text": "And that makes sense, because I have a positive divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3312, "text": "It's really just a derivative of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3313, "text": "And if we go here, where the divergence is negative, let's pick an arbitrary spot.", "label": []}
{"id": 3314, "text": "Right? So anything along, at any point along that line, the divergence is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3315, "text": "Now let's do a slightly fancier example, then we'll try to analyze the vector field.", "label": []}

{"id": 3317, "text": "Now before I show you the graph, let's analyze this function a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3318, "text": "And so you have a positive diverge, or you're getting less dense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3319, "text": "And they're both = <EXPRESSION> if we have any combination of these points.", "label": []}
{"id": 3320, "text": "And the other interesting thing we said, OK, when does the divergence = <EXPRESSION>? Well, the divergence equaled <EXPRESSION> along the line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3321, "text": "And we can simplify this a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3322, "text": "So if we set that = <EXPRESSION>, oh, sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 3323, "text": "I'll see you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 3324, "text": "Let's say this square right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3325, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3326, "text": "That's my major flaw, adding and subtracting.", "label": []}
{"id": 3327, "text": "Let me draw my twig.", "label": []}
{"id": 3328, "text": "But the magnitude of the vectors increase, they increase perpendicular, they increase in the y-dimension, right? And when this happens, when the flow is going in the same direction, but it's going at a different magnitude, you see that any object in it will rotate, right? So let's think about that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3329, "text": "But that makes sense, also, because as you go in the x-direction, the magnitudes of the vectors increase.", "label": []}
{"id": 3330, "text": "You put a twig there, what would happen to the twig? If the twig rotates and there's some curl, if the magnitude of the rotation is larger, then the curl is larger.", "label": []}
{"id": 3331, "text": "But the top of the twig is going to be being pushed to the right faster than the bottom of the twig, right? So what's going to happen? The twig's going to rotate, right? After, I don't know, some period of time, the twig's going to look something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3332, "text": "Because when we, you might want to review our original videos where we compared the dot product to the cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 3333, "text": "What's going to happen to the twig? Well, at this point on the twig, the water's moving to the right, so it'll push this part of the twig to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3334, "text": "So what's the intuition there? All of a sudden, we care about how much is the magnitude of a vector changing, not in its direction of motion, like in the divergence example, but we care how much is the magnitude of a vector changing as we go perpendicular to its direction of motion.", "label": []}
{"id": 3335, "text": "So for given <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of your <EXPRESSION> vector might stay the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 3336, "text": "So you can see that because the vectors increasing in a direction that is perpendicular to our direction of motion, right? This fairly simple example, all of the vectors point in the x-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3337, "text": "But this Dell operator, we use it a bunch of times.", "label": []}
{"id": 3338, "text": "Because remember, if this is a vector, and then as we increase this in the x-direction, the vectors increase, we took a little point, and we said, oh, at this point we're going to have more leaving than entering, so we have a positive divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3339, "text": "I didn't even label the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 3340, "text": "And maybe in the x-direction they're constant, regardless of your level of <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude stays.", "label": []}
{"id": 3341, "text": "Because the dot product was, how much do two vectors move together? So when you're taking this Dell operator and dotting it with a vector field, you're saying, how much is the vector field changing, right? All a derivative is, a partial derivative or a normal derivative, it's just a rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 3342, "text": "At the top of the twig, the water is also moving to the right, maybe with a faster velocity, but it's also going to push the top of the twig to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3343, "text": "Maybe it's just, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3344, "text": "And remember, these are just sample points on our vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3345, "text": "And you'll see that there's a net torque on the twig.", "label": []}
{"id": 3346, "text": "So here, even if we make <EXPRESSION> larger, we still get the same magnitude.", "label": []}
{"id": 3347, "text": "And so just like what we did with torque, we now care about the direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3348, "text": "So this might give you a little intuition of what is the curl.", "label": []}
{"id": 3349, "text": "So the magnitude of the x-direction is just a function of your <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3350, "text": "That's enough of just getting the intuition behind that vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3351, "text": "The bottom will move a little bit to the right, but the top will move a lot more to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3352, "text": "In the next video, I'll actually compute curl, and maybe we'll try to draw a couple more to hit the intuition home.", "label": []}
{"id": 3353, "text": "If it rotates in the other direction, you'll have the negative direction of curl.", "label": []}
{"id": 3354, "text": "And the ultimate would be, let me draw another vector field, the ultimate would be if I had this situation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3355, "text": "If I were to, let's say that this vector field shows the velocity of a fluid at various points.", "label": []}
{"id": 3356, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3357, "text": "So here I've drawn, I'm going to just draw a two-dimensional vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3358, "text": "Right? And the whole thing would have been shifted to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 3359, "text": "So if you put a twig here, you would definitely hopefully see that the twig, not only will it not be shifted to the right, this side is going to be moved to the left, this side is going to be the right, it's going to be rotated.", "label": []}
{"id": 3360, "text": "Anyway, I realize I've already pushed 9 minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 3361, "text": "It's only dependent on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3362, "text": "So I mean, this vector field might look something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3363, "text": "You know, if the partial derivative of something in the i-direction, plus the partial derivative, something with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the j-direction, plus the partial derivative, well, this is if we do it in three dimensions with respect to <EXPRESSION> in the k-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3364, "text": "And this should be a little bit intuitive to you, at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3365, "text": "When we applied it to just a scalar or vector field, you know, like a three-dimensional function, we just multiplied this times that scalar function, we got the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 3366, "text": "But anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 3367, "text": "And if that was where your intuition led you, and that is what your guess is, you would be correct.", "label": []}
{"id": 3368, "text": "But for any given <EXPRESSION>, it's always going to be the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 3369, "text": "And it is a measure of how much is that field rotating, or maybe if you imagine an object in the field, how much is the field causing something to rotate because it's exerting a net torque? Because at different points in the object, you have a different magnitude of a field in the same direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3370, "text": "Partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is rate of change in the x-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3371, "text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is relatively low, our magnitude vector goes in the <EXPRESSION> direction, when it increases a little bit, it gets a little bit longer.", "label": []}
{"id": 3372, "text": "Hopefully that example I just showed you will make a little bit of sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3373, "text": "And as your <EXPRESSION> get bigger and bigger, the magnitude in your x-direction will get bigger and bigger, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the y direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3374, "text": "So now, the intuition, because now we don't care about the rate of change along with the direction of the vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3375, "text": "You can kind of write it as a vector operator, and then it has a little bit more meeting.", "label": []}
{"id": 3376, "text": "I'm just making up numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 3377, "text": "And so, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 3378, "text": "And maybe after a little bit further, maybe it looks something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3379, "text": "Let's say I place a twig right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 3380, "text": "And so if you have a different speed for different levels of <EXPRESSION>, as something moves in the x-direction, it's going to be rotated, right? You could almost view it as if there's a net torque on an object that sits in the water here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3381, "text": "You can extrapolate to <EXPRESSION>, but when we're getting the intuition, it's good to do it in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3382, "text": "So you could imagine up here that's going to the left, with a fairly large magnitude.", "label": []}
{"id": 3383, "text": "So all you're saying is, when you're taking a dot product, how much is my rate of change increasing in my direction of movement? How much is my rate of change in the y-direction increasing in the y-direction? And so it makes sense that it helps us with divergence.", "label": []}
{"id": 3384, "text": "We care about the rate of change of the magnitudes of the vectors perpendicular the direction of the vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3385, "text": "Anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "label": []}
{"id": 3386, "text": "If I were to take a little twig or something, and I were to place it in this fluid, so let me place the twig right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3387, "text": "That is the curl of the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3388, "text": "We've been dealing with this Dell vector or this, you know, we could call this abusive notation, but it kind of is intuitive, although it really doesn't have any meaning when I describe it like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3389, "text": "So when we learned about dot and cross product, what did we learn? We learned that the dot product of <EXPRESSION> vectors tells you how much <EXPRESSION> vectors move together, and the cross product tells you how much the perpendicular, it's kind of the multiplication of the perpendicular components of a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 3390, "text": "Because the curl essentially measures what is the rotational effect, or I guess you could say, what is the curl of a vector field at a given point? And you can you can visualize it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3391, "text": "See you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 3392, "text": "So as we can see, as our change in the y-direction, as we go in the y-direction, the <EXPRESSION> of our vectors get larger and larger.", "label": []}
{"id": 3393, "text": "So let's say I place a twig, it's a funny-looking twig, but that's good enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 3394, "text": "And so you can view this, we're looking down on a river, maybe.", "label": []}
{"id": 3395, "text": "Anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "label": []}
{"id": 3396, "text": "Let me draw another vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3397, "text": "Because we care whether it's going counterclockwise or clockwise, so we're going to end up with a vector quantity, right? So, and all of this should hopefully start fitting together at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3398, "text": "So if the derivative, the partial derivative, of this vector field with respect to <EXPRESSION> is increasing or decreasing, if it's just changing, that means as we increase in <EXPRESSION>, or as we decrease in <EXPRESSION>, the magnitude of the <EXPRESSION> of our vectors, right, the x-direction of our vectors changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 3399, "text": "Before I actually show you the mechanics of what the curl of a vector field really is, let's try to get a little bit of intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3400, "text": "If I had this situation, where maybe down here it's like this, then maybe it's like this, and then maybe it gets really small, then maybe it switches directions, up here, and then the vector field goes like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3401, "text": "But it's going to rotate a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 3402, "text": "But let me ask you a question.", "label": []}
{"id": 3403, "text": "So the curl, you might guess, = the cross product of our Dell operator and the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3404, "text": "When we took the dot product of this with a vector field, we got the divergence of the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3405, "text": "Don't want to make that mistake; this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3406, "text": "So this is maybe messier than I originally intended.", "label": []}
{"id": 3407, "text": "Erase that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3408, "text": "So you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 3409, "text": "What's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, so it's going to be well, we can just put the <EXPRESSION> out front, but eventually we want to write our magnitude before the vector so it's <EXPRESSION> times the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> with our constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 3410, "text": "So then this becomes plus, plus, plus.", "label": []}
{"id": 3411, "text": "This is just a constant, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3412, "text": "We'll take the curl of a fairly fancy vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3413, "text": "And then finally our <EXPRESSION> component.", "label": []}
{"id": 3414, "text": "And you'll get something fairly hairy, although this was, I think, a hairier than average problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 3415, "text": "Then here it's <EXPRESSION> I should written all of this bigger and then the third column, the <EXPRESSION> component is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3416, "text": "Yeah, that's pretty much it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3417, "text": "That's what I wanted to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 3418, "text": "This is just kind of the algorithm of how do you take a determinant.", "label": []}
{"id": 3419, "text": "And that's the magnitude in our k-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3420, "text": "Well the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, right? So the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3421, "text": "No, that's not what I wanted to do; I wanted to do it in a darker color.", "label": []}
{"id": 3422, "text": "So how do we do this? So the cross product is going to be = I didn't have to draw a straight line so how you take the cross product of this vector field and the gradient operator? Well, you write <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> on top like you're taking the cross product of any two three dimensional vectors, and then you take the first vector but it's really a vector operator, but it's this del operator.", "label": []}
{"id": 3423, "text": "Well, when you were using this engineering notation, when you have a vector broken down into it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components, or it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components, you can take the determinant of that matrix when I showed you how to compute the cross product to figure out the cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 3424, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, cross these columns there, minus the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3425, "text": "Just the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components.", "label": []}
{"id": 3426, "text": "So this = the <EXPRESSION> let me use a more vibrant color the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3427, "text": "Maybe we'll graph it for fun just to see how messed up it looks but we said this curl, you could view it as a cross product of our del operator and the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3428, "text": "OK, then finally we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3429, "text": "If you multiply the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> operator times that expression, you're really just taking, since it's an operator and not an expression, you're really just going to take the partial of this with respect to y, but I'll write it down.", "label": []}
{"id": 3430, "text": "This is the curl of the vector field <EXPRESSION> at any <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3431, "text": "And now we have minus because minus in the j-direction what's the partial derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, the partial of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3432, "text": "Why don't we take this row and columns, and this is the submatrix of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3433, "text": "We're almost there.", "label": []}
{"id": 3434, "text": "And now finally, plus, what's the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>? Well, these are just constants, so it's <EXPRESSION> once again, we just have a <EXPRESSION> term; everything else is a constant so the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3435, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is just a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 3436, "text": "So you cross out it's row and column, and so you take the determinant of this expression, so it's going to be times this times this, but it's really the partial.", "label": []}
{"id": 3437, "text": "And we're pretty much done.", "label": []}
{"id": 3438, "text": "I mean we can simplify it a little bit just to make it clean.", "label": []}
{"id": 3439, "text": "So the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this, sorry, we take out it's row and column, so <EXPRESSION> of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3440, "text": "So let me just take this expression and I'll multiply it by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3441, "text": "Now let's actually compute it because if your sole goal is to pass a test and not understand the nature of the universe, which I think would be sad, but if that is your goal you at least need to know how to calculate these things.", "label": []}
{"id": 3442, "text": "Well, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3443, "text": "Hopefully you understood what I did here and now we got this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3444, "text": "And now I think I can erase all of this and just so I can have some room to simplify things in.", "label": []}
{"id": 3445, "text": "All right, now let me try to simplify it, and I'll have to get some space.", "label": []}
{"id": 3446, "text": "And now we are ready to take the determinant, which will probably, well, it'll probably get pretty messy, but let's try it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3447, "text": "In the next video, we'll do a little bit of this, but I think it'll give you more intuition and less of just the algorithm and the computation of how do you do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3448, "text": "So its <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> components are the partials with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3449, "text": "And then you'll hopefully never forget it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3450, "text": "But it's even more fun when you have the intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 3451, "text": "And what are the components of the del operator? It's the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, the partial derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, partial derivative with respect to , right? Let me just rewrite the del operator.", "label": []}
{"id": 3452, "text": "Now we just have to simplify it, taking a bunch of partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 3453, "text": "You can view it as being = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3454, "text": "Now minus the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3455, "text": "And then the second, where we're taking this operator cross the vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3456, "text": "Welcome back.", "label": []}
{"id": 3457, "text": "Oh, and sorry, when you take the determinant, you use that and this is all kind of a bit of voodoo but you put a plus here, a minus here, a plus here, so it's kind of this checkered pattern.", "label": []}
{"id": 3458, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to have all of that; that's the magnitude in our i-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3459, "text": "So now what's the magnitude of our curl in the j-direction? Let's cross out the row in the column of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3460, "text": "Now we said that you can view the curl of this vector field and I have no intuition of what this vector field looks like; I just made this up.", "label": []}
{"id": 3461, "text": "And essentially we could just, I don't have to rewrite it, we can just multiply this by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3462, "text": "And then what's the derivative of this with respect to y? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3463, "text": "Let me start over, actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 3464, "text": "Erase that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3465, "text": "And that's the magnitude in the j-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3466, "text": "So let's say our vector field and I'll do a three dimensional vector field just to do a fairly complicated example; I'm just going to make it up on the fly so let's say in the x-direction the magnitude of the field is, I don't know, let's say it's <EXPRESSION>, in the x-direction, plus I don't know let's make it <EXPRESSION> in the j-direction, or the y-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3467, "text": "To this is <EXPRESSION>, this should actually be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3468, "text": "Hopefully you have a little intuition now of what the curl is.", "label": []}
{"id": 3469, "text": "One that I have trouble visualizing but that we can mathematically chug through.", "label": []}
{"id": 3470, "text": "So it's a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3471, "text": "You just literally take the cross product of that del operator and your vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3472, "text": "So we'll write <EXPRESSION>, and let's put the minus out front; these are what's multiplied.", "label": []}
{"id": 3473, "text": "So what are the components of the vector field? I'll probably run out of space, but it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3474, "text": "The partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> let's put the minus out front <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3475, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is just a constant, so it just carries over, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3476, "text": "OK, and then we have minus, now we stick the partial with respect sorry, actually, I forgot to do this part.", "label": []}
{"id": 3477, "text": "And then that should be oh, there we go minus this expression, the partial of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3478, "text": "So it's going to be the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> and now we're on to our <EXPRESSION> component plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3479, "text": "And in the z-direction, I don't know, let's make it <EXPRESSION>, in the z-direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3480, "text": "So that's how you calculate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3481, "text": "So that's our new vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 3482, "text": "If I had a little stick here, I'd be pushing in this direction, with not that much of a magnitude in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3483, "text": "Because the difference in magnitudes of these <EXPRESSION> you could almost view them as the torque producing forces the difference in magnitude is enough that you'd still have the same counterclockwise rotation here as you would have here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3484, "text": "Now let's do a little experiment.", "label": []}
{"id": 3485, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3486, "text": "So the curl, at any point of this vector field, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3487, "text": "Let's see if that makes sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3488, "text": "So this was our old graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 3489, "text": "Or nothing would be entering into that circle, or in any given amount of time the concentration of that circle wouldn't change.", "label": []}
{"id": 3490, "text": "Which would have meant that we would have had no rotation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3491, "text": "So this term let's see, partial derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3492, "text": "So this = the partial derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3493, "text": "Just because I have <EXPRESSION> minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 3494, "text": "And even though this looks like a two dimensional vector field, we actually have to take the cross product in <EXPRESSION> dimensions.", "label": []}
{"id": 3495, "text": "So we're done analyzing this vector field.", "label": []}

{"id": 3497, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> component is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3499, "text": "Make the window bigger.", "label": []}
{"id": 3500, "text": "I would have the forces or the fluids pushing in in this direction, but they're not helping to rotate, and pushing out in that direction.", "label": []}

{"id": 3606, "text": "And what's the intuition of that? Well, if we just look at it mathematically, if we have <EXPRESSION> curl, somehow, the rotation in our <EXPRESSION> direction must be being offset by a rotation in the y direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3607, "text": "See you in the next video.", "label": []}

{"id": 3618, "text": "But it would.", "label": []}

{"id": 3647, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 3648, "text": "So far, we've used integrals to figure out the area under a curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 3649, "text": "That's the intuition behind the definite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 3650, "text": "If I wanted to figure out the area under this curve, between, let's say, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3651, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, a very small change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3652, "text": "That's my y-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 3653, "text": "But if I have some function this is the <EXPRESSION> plane, that's the x-axis, that's the y-axis and I have some function.", "label": []}
{"id": 3654, "text": "And then if we integrated it, from <EQUATION>, which was back here, all the way to <EQUATION>, what would it look like? It would look like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3655, "text": "So let's make a square bound first, because this keeps it a lot simpler.", "label": []}
{"id": 3656, "text": "Say, here, I'll put it into the function and it'll give us a <EXPRESSION> value now.", "label": []}
{"id": 3657, "text": "And let's just review a little bit of the intuition, although this should hopefully be second nature to you at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3658, "text": "And if we wanted to take the sum of all of these rectangles right? There's just going to be a bunch of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 3659, "text": "I'm making that that little cut that I took the area of by making it three dimensional.", "label": []}

{"id": 3665, "text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3666, "text": "And then we have the area in between it.", "label": []}
{"id": 3667, "text": "And the sum, or the areas that we're summing up, are going to be the height is <EXPRESSION>, and the width is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3669, "text": "We're going to take the sums of these rectangles, from <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3670, "text": "And we'll actually figure out the volume under this surface.", "label": []}

{"id": 3672, "text": "And then the height is going to be a function of the <EXPRESSION> I have and the <EXPRESSION> I picked.", "label": []}
{"id": 3673, "text": "And we have to specify bounds, right? From here, we said <EQUATION>, to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3674, "text": "So we want to make them infinitely small.", "label": []}
{"id": 3675, "text": "So how do we figure out the volume under a surface like this? How do we figure out the volume? It seems like a bit of a stretch, given what we've learned from this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3676, "text": "So this is the <EXPRESSION> direction, this is the <EXPRESSION> direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3677, "text": "But for some constant <EXPRESSION>, what if I could just figure out the area under the curve there? How would I figure out just the area under that curve? It'll be a function of which y I pick, right? Because if I pick a <EXPRESSION> here, it'll be a different area.", "label": []}
{"id": 3678, "text": "And that's just a little bit of review.", "label": []}
{"id": 3679, "text": "So let's say that the domain or the region not the domain the region of the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> region of this part of the surface under which we want to calculate the volume.", "label": []}
{"id": 3680, "text": "And then it'll pop out another number, and if we wanted to graph it, it'll be our height.", "label": []}
{"id": 3681, "text": "So we can write a surface as, instead of <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> I'm sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 3682, "text": "If I multiplied this area times a small <EXPRESSION>, then all of a sudden I have a sliver of volume.", "label": []}
{"id": 3683, "text": "But anyway, I didn't want to confuse you.", "label": []}

{"id": 3686, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3687, "text": "And so that could be the height of a surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 3688, "text": "And then the height of this rectangle is going to be <EXPRESSION>, at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 3689, "text": "But that's the intuition of what we're going to do.", "label": []}

{"id": 3725, "text": "And let's say I have some surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 3726, "text": "So what we want to figure out is the volume under the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 3727, "text": "Although I'm assuming, to some degree, that that's a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3730, "text": "So, for example, you give me a coordinate in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 3731, "text": "So what would be the area of this sheet of paper? It's kind of a constant <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3732, "text": "Now if I added all of those sheets that now have depth, if I took the infinite sum so if I took the integral of this from my lower <EXPRESSION> bound from <EXPRESSION> to my upper <EXPRESSION> bound, <EXPRESSION>, then at least based on our intuition here maybe I will have figured out the volume under this surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 3733, "text": "See you soon.", "label": []}
{"id": 3734, "text": "Let's say that's <EXPRESSION>, right? That's a change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3735, "text": "So first of all, what is a surface? Well, if we're thinking in <EXPRESSION> dimensions, a surface is going to be a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3736, "text": "But as you can see, it's a server.", "label": []}
{"id": 3737, "text": "Let's see, let me rotate it to its traditional form.", "label": []}

{"id": 3739, "text": "What are the bounds? You can almost view what are the bounds of the domain? Well, let's say that this point let's say that this right here, that's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> in the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 3740, "text": "Let's say, the shadow if the sun was right above the surface, the shadow would be right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 3741, "text": "It's like a piece of paper that's bent.", "label": []}
{"id": 3742, "text": "Now if I multiply this whole thing times <EXPRESSION>, I get this volume.", "label": []}
{"id": 3743, "text": "And let's say that this line right here is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3744, "text": "Where let me draw one of those rectangles where you could view and there's different ways to do this, but this is just a review.", "label": []}

{"id": 3746, "text": "Fair enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 3747, "text": "Hope you get that, right? This is the <EXPRESSION> plane.", "label": []}

{"id": 3888, "text": "So now we can make our substitutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 3889, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is also <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3890, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 3891, "text": "Now why was my problem that I gave you silly? Well, I could have simplified this before even doing the substitution, right? I could have said that that's the same thing as the integral of <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3893, "text": "I keep using that.", "label": []}

{"id": 3895, "text": "But we'll continue doing it with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 3896, "text": "But we can say then that <EXPRESSION>, and we know that <EXPRESSION> as well, which is, once again, mind blowing.", "label": []}

{"id": 3899, "text": "So this, as we see, simplifies to the <EXPRESSION>, and that that =, let's see.", "label": []}

{"id": 3906, "text": "Well, once again, we have this expression <EXPRESSION>, and what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, as we learned, which is <EXPRESSION> of these things that amazes me, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3908, "text": "Image, clear image, image, invert.", "label": []}
{"id": 3909, "text": "That looks complicated to you, doesn't it? Well, just like we said, this is a pattern, like we saw in the previous examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 3910, "text": "So let's make the substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 3911, "text": "Actually, that's <EXPRESSION> definition for <EXPRESSION>, is number which, when it's raised to the <EXPRESSION> power, it's the derivative of the same expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 3912, "text": "So this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> actually do cancel out, and you're left with, that this = the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3913, "text": "And what's <EXPRESSION>? Well, we just showed, <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, right? So it's times <EXPRESSION>, and then we have times <EXPRESSION>, right? And I know you're probably not too comfortable with the differentials at this point, but they behave in just the way regular numbers do with a fraction.", "label": []}
{"id": 3914, "text": "That's what we said at the beginning.", "label": []}
{"id": 3915, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3916, "text": "And while we know that the answer of this integral, this = <EXPRESSION>, and then, of course, we should add the plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3917, "text": "So what we can now do is substitute these <EXPRESSION> things into this integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 3918, "text": "And now this is an easy integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 3919, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3920, "text": "I'll do it up here to make it extra messy.", "label": []}

{"id": 3927, "text": "We have this expression here, <EXPRESSION>, and well, what's the derivative of this? <EXPRESSION>? Well, it's <EXPRESSION>, right? Notice that I'm engineering it so it works cleanly, but most textbooks and tests tend to do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3928, "text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>, right? Because this is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3929, "text": "This is just = <EXPRESSION>, right, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3930, "text": "But anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much.", "label": []}
{"id": 3931, "text": "So if we rewrite this top integral, this is just =, I won't switch this time.", "label": []}
{"id": 3932, "text": "So the integral now becomes, instead of writing <EXPRESSION>, we can write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3933, "text": "Let's say to the minus third power.", "label": []}

{"id": 3938, "text": "So this is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3943, "text": "The only thing different than what you might have seen recently is that instead of an <EXPRESSION>, we have a <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 3944, "text": "And now we can just unwind this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3945, "text": "But anyway, that's integration by substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 3946, "text": "Actually, this might be an easier way to think about these type of integrals than what I did in the last presentation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3947, "text": "And actually, I just realized, I constructed a very silly problem for you, because you could simplify this before even doing it with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 3948, "text": "And I know you're not completely comfortable yet with even this integration notation, why is this <EXPRESSION> sitting there in the first place, but when we do the definite integrals it will make more sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3949, "text": "And I know what you're thinking, Sal.", "label": []}
{"id": 3950, "text": "But anyway, you see, if you did it in this way, it becomes very complicated, so we don't want to do it like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 3951, "text": "But this is just = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3952, "text": "All of this to the sixth power, plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3958, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> simplifies things a lot.", "label": []}
{"id": 3959, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3960, "text": "Well, everything we have in our integration tool kit so far I don't think help us here, right? Because we don't have a function and its derivative, so we can't do substitution or which is the same thing as the reverse chain rule this isn't a simple polynomial.", "label": []}
{"id": 3961, "text": "I haven't proven it to you yet, but it's usually in the inside cover of your calculus book.", "label": []}
{"id": 3962, "text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>? It was the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3963, "text": "We always, in math in general, you always want to simplify.", "label": []}
{"id": 3964, "text": "So that's the intuition, and let me just solve through it, and hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 3965, "text": "What's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, yeah, it's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3966, "text": "So what did I just do? It looks like I just well, I am just essentially playing with the product rule from differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3967, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3968, "text": "I guess if you have this in your tool kit and actually you have it beyond the exam on this type of integral, and you actually keep it and you retain it, then you, I think, will become an integration jock.", "label": []}

{"id": 3970, "text": "That's all I did.", "label": []}
{"id": 3971, "text": "So if I assume that <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> this yellow term, let me write it in yellow, just for fun so <EXPRESSION> so I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3972, "text": "This is the same exact thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 3973, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3974, "text": "I don't even have to look it up.", "label": []}
{"id": 3975, "text": "But let's just move forward.", "label": []}
{"id": 3976, "text": "It's not making it any more complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 3977, "text": "Transcript for: Indefinite Integration (part V) I'm not going to do a presentation on a type of integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 3978, "text": "See, I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and I'm saying that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 3980, "text": "I'll see you in the next presentation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3981, "text": "And let's say <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3982, "text": "And I think you would agree that we've now simplified this a good bit, because this is just the integral of <EXPRESSION>, right? So this is just = <EXPRESSION> this is just this first term right here minus and what's the integral of <EXPRESSION>? Well, the derivative of well, let me make it even simpler.", "label": []}
{"id": 3983, "text": "So that's an introduction to integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 3984, "text": "Well, I already said that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3985, "text": "So if you encounter this when you're doing integrals, kind of the last tool kit and this is pretty sophisticated is to do integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 3986, "text": "And now this might seem a little bit arbitrary, and it is a little bit arbitrary, let me take well, I could take either of these but let me just take this <EXPRESSION> and move it to this side of the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3987, "text": "This can be a little confusing.", "label": []}
{"id": 3988, "text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3989, "text": "And I'll show you where this is useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 3990, "text": "But anyway, let me show you what I'm talking about.", "label": []}
{"id": 3991, "text": "So let's say I had <EXPRESSION> functions, let's say <EXPRESSION>, and I wanted to take the derivative of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 3992, "text": "And now it's really easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 3993, "text": "And so, we could say this so let me change colors, because this could get confusing this term right here, we could say that term <EXPRESSION> = this term let me switch back to the yellow = <EXPRESSION> minus this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 3994, "text": "So I'm going to subtract this term from both sides of this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 3995, "text": "And the reason why I knew <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is because I said the derivative, I said <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3996, "text": "Well what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? Well, we said <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right? So the derivative is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3997, "text": "I like this more, because it naturally makes more sense to me.", "label": []}
{"id": 3998, "text": "And we also want to take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 3999, "text": "And we should never forget the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4000, "text": "But when you do calculus it's been about fifteen years since I learned it and I just remember integration by parts is just really a derivation of the product rule, and that gets me back to the format.", "label": []}
{"id": 4001, "text": "And the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is just as complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 4002, "text": "The reason why I'm going to assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and I'm going to assume <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, is because later we want to take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4003, "text": "You might want to memorize it for the exam, because it's faster for when you take the AP exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 4004, "text": "So that's the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4005, "text": "Actually, well I'm running out of space, but I'll write it in the corner right down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4006, "text": "And then I can use it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4007, "text": "So what I'm going to do and you might view this as, well, Sal, how did you know to do this? And I'll tell you my thought process actually after I show you what I did.", "label": []}
{"id": 4008, "text": "You get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4009, "text": "So we just used the product rule to derive this formula for integration by parts, and in a lot of calculus books they do this <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4010, "text": "And you probably wondering, well, Sal, this is all nice and it looks fancy, but what good is this going to do me? Well, what I essentially just did is I kind of proved this you could call this a formula, but I often forget it, especially once I haven't done it a long time, and then I actually just reprove it to myself just by remembering the product rule but this is called integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 4011, "text": "Well the chain rule just told us that this is just the same thing as, let's say, the derivative of the first function <EXPRESSION> times the second function <EXPRESSION> plus now the first function <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of the second function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4012, "text": "I hope you understand what I'm saying.", "label": []}
{"id": 4013, "text": "And I'll show you where I'm going with this in a second.", "label": []}
{"id": 4014, "text": "In the next presentation, I will do a bunch of examples well, as many as I can fit in to <EXPRESSION> minutes of actually using integration by parts to solve fairly fancy integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 4015, "text": "So in this situation, we could assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and we could assume that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or we could assume the other way around.", "label": []}
{"id": 4016, "text": "Because I put it onto this side of the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 4017, "text": "Let me write it separately here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4018, "text": "And actually, try it the other way around, and you'll see that if you took the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, you would get something that's more complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 4019, "text": "And then this is minus the integral of the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4020, "text": "So let's just remember what the product rule of differentiation was.", "label": []}
{"id": 4021, "text": "And so how can we use this for integration by parts? Well, integration by parts tells us that if we have an integral where we have a function and then the derivative of another function, then we could use this formula to hopefully simplify it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4022, "text": "So you know, if the function if the derivative of a function is cosine, then we know the function itself is sine.", "label": []}
{"id": 4023, "text": "It's easier for me to read, and I can derive at any time, just from the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 4024, "text": "So if we were to integrate both sides well if you integrate this side, you're taking the integral of a derivative, you just get back to what you took the derivative originally of, so this just becomes <EXPRESSION>, and then we have to integrate the right hand side, well that just becomes and we're doing the indefinite integral, kind of the antiderivative, but we can use this tool when we do definite integrals as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 4025, "text": "So I don't have to necessarily memorize it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4026, "text": "But if you're seeing it on an exam, you know it's a solvable integral, and if you can't solve it any other way, it's probably integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 4027, "text": "Let me try to stay color consistent.", "label": []}
{"id": 4028, "text": "Don't want to forget my dx's.", "label": []}
{"id": 4029, "text": "I know that if I take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, that simplifies it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4030, "text": "Because this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4031, "text": "Welcome back.", "label": []}
{"id": 4032, "text": "So it's probably a good idea to say that <EXPRESSION> = it's probably, let me change colors it's probably a good idea to make <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>, because later I'm going to take the derivative of it, and the derivative of it simplifies it, and it's probably a good idea to make <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, because later, I'm going to take the antiderivative of it, and the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4033, "text": "So that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4034, "text": "And that's minus the integral of the derivative of the first function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4035, "text": "But once again, when I look at this, I'm like, well, how do I solve this? I can't use the integration by substitution, because there's not an embedded function and then I have the derivative of it sitting right next to it, so.", "label": []}
{"id": 4036, "text": "So there's <EXPRESSION>, and then this minus, you distribute it so it becomes a plus, so then it's plus <EXPRESSION> I just took the minus, I multiplied it times this minus, so I got a <EXPRESSION> and then the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4037, "text": "Magenta.", "label": []}
{"id": 4038, "text": "Pretty fancy, no? We've figured out the antiderivative, the indefinite integral of <EXPRESSION> is this big fancy thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4039, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4040, "text": "It actually turns out you'll just have to do this many many many many times, but every time you do integration by parts, that the exponent on the x-term just becomes smaller and smaller and smaller until you get to something that's really easy to integrate, and then you can do it, and you'll have kind of this big long expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 4041, "text": "And you can kind of keep reverting back to the top formula if you get confused.", "label": []}
{"id": 4042, "text": "So if that is the case, that this integral is going to = because we have the minus sign out front, this minus sign out front this integral is going to = <EXPRESSION> where <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4043, "text": "Maybe not soon, but in the next couple of weeks, on just a lot of integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 4044, "text": "See you in the next presentation.", "label": []}

{"id": 4047, "text": "Just so and it's a little messy.", "label": []}
{"id": 4048, "text": "Then I would try to see, is there the derivative of something, of <EXPRESSION> function, of kind of a composite function here so I can do the reverse chain rule.", "label": []}

{"id": 4050, "text": "Remember, we're kind of doing a new problem within the original big problem.", "label": []}

{"id": 4053, "text": "So let's say let me do it separately let's assume I think you getting a little bit of the hang of it along the same vein, that this is <EXPRESSION>, that this is <EXPRESSION>, and that this is <EXPRESSION> now.", "label": []}

{"id": 4056, "text": "Interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 4057, "text": "And then from that, we subtract the integral, we take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, so you get <EXPRESSION>, and then times the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4058, "text": "But it just says that if we have an integral of <EXPRESSION> so if you see, within the integral, sign, <EXPRESSION> function and then you see the derivative of another function, and I think with practice integration by parts is really a bit of an art.", "label": []}

{"id": 4062, "text": "So let me just write the formula for integration by parts, and if you ever forget it I mean, it doesn't hurt to memorize it, but if you ever forget it you just really have to just derive it from the product rule of differentiation.", "label": []}

{"id": 4089, "text": "Now I think we have an integral that is pretty straightforward to solve.", "label": []}

{"id": 4095, "text": "The example using <EXPRESSION> might be a little complicated, because it's hard to tell whether I've taken the derivative or not.", "label": []}

{"id": 4158, "text": "This is the anti-derivative.", "label": []}

{"id": 4201, "text": "You could rewrite this, this = let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 4248, "text": "So if we could get it in a form that looks like this, we'd be all set.", "label": []}
{"id": 4249, "text": "So that we can replace with this, minus du.", "label": []}
{"id": 4250, "text": "Let me rewrite it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4251, "text": "So now this integral becomes and the denominator, instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4252, "text": "That's = minus du.", "label": []}
{"id": 4253, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4254, "text": "And the problem he sent me and I hope I pronounced his name right was the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4255, "text": "It's a little bit less ambiguous.", "label": []}
{"id": 4256, "text": "So if <EQUATION>, this thing = <EXPRESSION> = the antiderivative of our original problem, which was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4257, "text": "Either way, I like looking at this a bit better.", "label": []}
{"id": 4258, "text": "And so you're just left with <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> is the antiderivative oh sorry, we're not done yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 4259, "text": "And then you'd decrease the exponent by <EXPRESSION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4260, "text": "This integral would be easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 4261, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, right? We made that definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 4262, "text": "And of course you're going to have a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4263, "text": "See you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 4264, "text": "If you don't believe it take the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 4265, "text": "That's just the antiderivative of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4266, "text": "And now we have our substitution to deal with.", "label": []}
{"id": 4267, "text": "So that's the big clue that we should be using <EXPRESSION> substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4268, "text": "And what we're going to do is we're going to substitute <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4269, "text": "And let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 4270, "text": "We could have rewritten this top integral, we could have rewritten it like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4271, "text": "That's a positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 4272, "text": "I'm just writing it a bunch of different ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 4273, "text": "Keep that in mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 4274, "text": "So actually, if you look at it, I mean you could just eyeball it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4275, "text": "Well let's look at this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4276, "text": "And let me graph that as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 4277, "text": "Right, this is the velocity, so say we had over this very small change in time, we have this roughly constant velocity that's on this graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 4278, "text": "So let actually use an example from physics.", "label": []}
{"id": 4279, "text": "Let me write this in the corner.", "label": []}
{"id": 4280, "text": "So <EQUATION>, and then <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4281, "text": "That's a horrible line.", "label": []}
{"id": 4282, "text": "In this case, the object started at position of <EXPRESSION>, but it could be, you know, at any constant, right? You could have started here and then curved up.", "label": []}
{"id": 4283, "text": "I won't draw it that steep because I'm going to use this for an illustration.", "label": []}
{"id": 4284, "text": "For the purposes of this lecture, you can't go back in time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4285, "text": "So it's actually a pretty steep line.", "label": []}
{"id": 4286, "text": "We have this roughly constant velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4287, "text": "I don't know why the convention is to use s as the variable for distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 4288, "text": "Let me switch to something more pleasant.", "label": []}
{"id": 4289, "text": "So this is just a formula that tells us the position, kind of how far has something gone, after <EXPRESSION> many, let's say, seconds, right? So after like, <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone, let's say the distance is in feet, this is in seconds.", "label": []}
{"id": 4290, "text": "And I guess if you view it the other way, if you have the velocity, it's antiderivative is distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 4291, "text": "You can kind of view this as a very small change in time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4292, "text": "But if you have to distance formula, it's derivative is just velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4293, "text": "So we want to find the change, the instantaneous change with respect to time of this formula, right? Because this is the distance formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 4294, "text": "It'll get pretty close to, as you can imagine, the area under this curve, or in this case a line.", "label": []}
{"id": 4295, "text": "It's slightly better.", "label": []}
{"id": 4296, "text": "And we want to figure out what the distance is after, you know, <EXPRESSION> seconds, right? So this is the t-axis, this is the velocity axis, right? So let's say we were only given this, and let's say we didn't know that the antiderivative of the velocity function is the distance function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4297, "text": "So this is how much time goes by.", "label": []}
{"id": 4298, "text": "Let's say that <EXPRESSION> =, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4299, "text": "In this presentation, I actually want to show you how we can use the antiderivative to figure out the area under a curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 4300, "text": "And then we draw the x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 4301, "text": "If we have a constant, this red is kind of bloody.", "label": []}
{"id": 4302, "text": "Skinny and tall, right? It's almost infinitely skinny, but it's, we're assuming for these purposes it has some very notional amount of width.", "label": []}
{"id": 4303, "text": "Actually I'm going to focus more a little bit more on the intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 4304, "text": "Maybe I should switch back to, let me write that, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4305, "text": "Actually, let me undo that too, because I just want to do it for <EXPRESSION>, right? Because you can't really go back in time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4306, "text": "So the distance that the object travels over the small time would be the small time times the velocity, right? It would be whatever the value of this red line is, times the width of this distance, right? So what's another way? Visually I kind of did it ahead of time, but what's happening here? If I take this change in time, right, which is kind of the base of this rectangle, and I multiply it times the velocity which is really just the height of this rectangle, what have I figured out? Well I figured out the area of this rectangle, right? Right, the velocity this moment, times the change in time at this moment, is nothing but the area of this very skinny rectangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 4307, "text": "If we have, over any small period of time, right, or if we have a constant velocity, when you have a constant velocity, distance is just velocity times time, right? So let's say we had a very small time fragment here, right? I'll draw it big, but let's say this time fragment it is really small.", "label": []}
{"id": 4308, "text": "This is velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4309, "text": "So this curve will essentially just be a parabola, right? It'll look something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4310, "text": "So if we know the instant rate of change of distance with respect to time, we'll know the velocity, right? So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, =? So what's the derivative here? It's <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is the velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4311, "text": "Or you can actually view it as instantaneous.", "label": []}
{"id": 4312, "text": "Actually, let me take do it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4313, "text": "But it would also get you pretty much the exact amount of distance you've traveled after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "label": []}
{"id": 4314, "text": "And that's actually <EXPRESSION> of the initial uses of what made derivatives so useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 4315, "text": "I'll use distance and velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4316, "text": "So this, I'll draw it in red, this is this going to be a line, right? <EXPRESSION> it's a line with slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4317, "text": "So I think I'm running into the <EXPRESSION> minute wall, so I'm just going to pause here, and I'm going to continue this in the next presentation.", "label": []}
{"id": 4318, "text": "And so what if we wanted to figure out what the velocity of this object, right? This is, let's see, this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, right? And this is, I don't know if it's clear, but this is kind of <EXPRESSION> a parabola.", "label": []}
{"id": 4319, "text": "But anyway, let's just assume we started at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4320, "text": "So let's graph this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4321, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 4322, "text": "That's all that says.", "label": []}
{"id": 4323, "text": "After <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone <EXPRESSION> feet.", "label": []}
{"id": 4324, "text": "It's pretty straight.", "label": []}
{"id": 4325, "text": "After <EXPRESSION> seconds, right? Well then, all we would have to do is, we would have to just figure, we would just do a bunch of <EXPRESSION>'s, right? You'd do another <EXPRESSION> here, you'd figure out the area of this column, you'd figure out the area of this column, the area of this column, right? Because each of these areas of each of these columns represents the distance that the object travels over that <EXPRESSION>, right? So if you wanted to know how far you traveled after <EXPRESSION> seconds, you'd essentially get, or an approximation would be, the sum of all of these areas.", "label": []}
{"id": 4326, "text": "So the derivative of distance is velocity, the antiderivative of velocity is distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 4327, "text": "I'm doing pretty good.", "label": []}
{"id": 4328, "text": "This is that graph, and this is distance, right? So in case you hadn't learned already, and maybe I'll do a whole presentation on kind of using calculus for physics, and using derivatives for physics.", "label": []}
{"id": 4329, "text": "What would the velocity be? Well the velocity is just, what's velocity? It's distance divided by time, right? And since this velocity is always changing, we want to figure out the instantaneous velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4330, "text": "The object, every second you go, it's going a little bit further, right? So it's actually accelerating.", "label": []}
{"id": 4331, "text": "So this is the velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4332, "text": "So that'll have to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 4333, "text": "Have to use the line tool, might have better luck.", "label": []}
{"id": 4334, "text": "And actually this could be a good review for derivatives, or actually an application of derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 4335, "text": "Graph it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4336, "text": "How would we figure out, how would we figure out what the distance would be at any given time? Well let's think about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4337, "text": "This will actually be a fairly straightforward graph to draw.", "label": []}
{"id": 4338, "text": "So there we figured out the area of this column, right? Well, if we wanted to figure out the distance that you travel after, let's say, you know, I don't know, let's say <EXPRESSION>, let's say <EXPRESSION>, right? This is just a particular <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4339, "text": "So if we have a very small change of time, and over that very small change in time, we have a roughly constant velocity, let's say the roughly constant velocity is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4340, "text": "Right? So s is distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 4341, "text": "So let's say that I described the position of something moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 4342, "text": "Let's assume that we were only given this graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 4343, "text": "The way I've used <EXPRESSION> is like, it's like a change in time that's unbelievably small, right? So it's like almost instantaneous, but not quite.", "label": []}
{"id": 4344, "text": "I don't know why I switched colors, but I'll stick with the yellow.", "label": []}
{"id": 4345, "text": "One would think, well actually, I know, why won't they use <EXPRESSION>? Because <EXPRESSION> is the letter used for differential, I guess.", "label": []}
{"id": 4346, "text": "So this is the distance function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4347, "text": "Let's say it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4348, "text": "And as you got more and more, as you made the dt's smaller and smaller, skinnier, skinnier, skinnier.", "label": []}
{"id": 4349, "text": "And let's called this very small time fragment, let call this delta <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 4350, "text": "Although you won't know where, at what position, the object started.", "label": []}
{"id": 4351, "text": "Transcript for: Introduction to definite integrals Welcome back.", "label": []}
{"id": 4352, "text": "And we said, you know, this is the graph of the velocity of some object.", "label": []}
{"id": 4353, "text": "And you had more and more and more and more of these rectangles, then your approximation will get pretty close to, well, <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 4354, "text": "So where I left off, we said that we had this, I guess you could call it, equation or this function, although I didn't write it with the function notation, where I said, the distance = <EXPRESSION>, and I graphed it, it's like a parabola, right, for positive time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4355, "text": "So and the way you evaluate an indefinite integral, and let me show you that first, is that you figure out the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4356, "text": "This tells us <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 4357, "text": "I mean, well, after <EXPRESSION> seconds, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 4358, "text": "What's a way that you could start to try to approximate how far you've traveled after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds? Well [? as I said, ?] you graph this, and you say, let's assume over some change in time, velocity is roughly constant, right? Let's say velocity is right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4359, "text": "Right? So let's say we call this distance <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4360, "text": "I'm running out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4361, "text": "And also, the area under this curve is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4362, "text": "So we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, right? That's evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract it, evaluate at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4363, "text": "Let me clear it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4364, "text": "So as these <EXPRESSION>'s approach <EXPRESSION>, the number of rectangles actually approach infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4365, "text": "Actually, maybe I'll stick with this example, but I'll clear it a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 4366, "text": "And it actually turns out that they're the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4367, "text": "So you could approximate how far you travel over that small change in time by multiplying that change in time, let's say that's like, you know, a millionth of a second, times the velocity at roughly that time, or maybe even the average velocity over that time, and you'd get the distance you've traveled over that very small fraction of time, right? But if you look at it visually, that also happens to be the area of this rectangle, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 4368, "text": "It's just, the velocity is always changing, you can't just take the slope, you actually have to take the derivative, right? So we took the derivative with respect to time of this function, or this equation, and we got <EXPRESSION>, and this is the velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4369, "text": "And so this is the definite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4370, "text": "and I'm going to take the sum of each of the heights, the height at any given point, which is the velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 4371, "text": "And we could actually figure it out, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 4372, "text": "Right? We start at <EXPRESSION> feet, and then we moved forward from there.", "label": []}
{"id": 4373, "text": "So I'm actually going to, I'll do that more rigorously later, but I think it's very important to get this intuitive feel of just what an integral is.", "label": []}
{"id": 4374, "text": "I think you know all this stuff now.", "label": []}
{"id": 4375, "text": "But anyway, so going back to the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 4376, "text": "And let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, let's say we didn't know this at all, and let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, because we just showed that, you know, the derivative of distance is velocity, so the antiderivative of velocity is distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 4377, "text": "It isn't just this voodoo that happens to be there.", "label": []}
{"id": 4378, "text": "The definite integral is literally, and they never do this in math texts, and that's what always kind of confused me, is that you can kind of view it like a sum, like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4379, "text": "And this is where I'm going to teach you the indefinite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4380, "text": "And actually, that's how, if you ever write a computer program to approximate an integral, or approximate the area under a curve, that's the way a computer program would actually do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4381, "text": "So after <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone <EXPRESSION> feet.", "label": []}
{"id": 4382, "text": "And we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, and we evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract the difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 4383, "text": "So let's say you couldn't just take the antiderivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 4384, "text": "And actually, I just looked at the clock.", "label": []}
{"id": 4385, "text": "Right? And the way you evaluate this, is you figure out the antiderivative, and you really don't have to do the <EXPRESSION> here, so the antiderivative, we know, is <EXPRESSION>, right? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4386, "text": "So the way you figure out the indefinite integral, is you say, and sometimes they won't write <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4387, "text": "That's actually how I view it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4388, "text": "Erasing might be a good option with this one, since it's fairly messy.", "label": []}
{"id": 4389, "text": "And what we said, is if you want to know how far you travel after <EXPRESSION> seconds, you just draw a bunch of these rectangles, and you sum up the area, right? And you could imagine, and you don't have to imagine, it's actually true, the smaller the bases of these rectangles, and the more of these rectangles you have, the more accurate your approximation will be, and you'll approach <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 4390, "text": "Right? So it's very interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 4391, "text": "So let me continue this in the next presentation.", "label": []}
{"id": 4392, "text": "They'll just say from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4393, "text": "Oh, that's ugly.", "label": []}
{"id": 4394, "text": "The indefinite integral tells us <EXPRESSION> things.", "label": []}
{"id": 4395, "text": "And this is the s, or distance, axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 4396, "text": "So let's use this to do a couple more examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 4397, "text": "I just need space.", "label": []}
{"id": 4398, "text": "And then we graphed it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4399, "text": "It could have been a variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 4400, "text": "But the actual indefinite integral says, well, this is a sum, but it's the limit as the bases of these rectangles get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and we have more and more and more of these rectangles.", "label": []}
{"id": 4401, "text": "So the integral from this is now a definite integral, extending from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4402, "text": "So let's say that the distance, yeah, well, let's just say it looks something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4403, "text": "So the indefinite integral, I don't know how comfortable you are with summation, I remember the first time I learned calculus, I wasn't that comfortable with summation, but it's really, all the indefinite integral, is is you can kind of view it as a sum, right? So now, you'll maybe understand a little bit more why this symbol looks kind of like a sigma.", "label": []}
{"id": 4404, "text": "This tells us the area of the curve from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>, right, it tells us this whole area, and it also tells us how far the object has gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "label": []}
{"id": 4405, "text": "Maybe, OK, so we have that indefinite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4406, "text": "And then, what's the formula for the velocity? It's <EXPRESSION> and then I'm at times the base at each of these rectangles, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4407, "text": "So this is something pretty interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 4408, "text": "Let's say you start at some distance, and then it goes off like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4409, "text": "I want to know how far is this thing gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.", "label": []}
{"id": 4410, "text": "And this axis is of course time, this axis, maybe I shouldn't do <EXPRESSION>, because it looks so much like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4411, "text": "So let me just say, let me continue with the problem, actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 4412, "text": "Well, let's just call this, you know, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4413, "text": "I'll now do it more general, actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 4414, "text": "I was like, well, we want to figure out, if we were given this, if we were given just this, and I asked you, what is the distance that this object travels after time, you know, after <EXPRESSION> seconds? Let's, you know, let's say this <EQUATION> seconds.", "label": []}
{"id": 4415, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4416, "text": "All of a sudden, we see that the antiderivative is pretty darn similar to the area under the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 4417, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> feet.", "label": []}
{"id": 4418, "text": "And then we said, well, the velocity, if we know the distance, the velocity is just the change of the distance with respect to time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4419, "text": "As you can tell, I don't plan much for these presentations.", "label": []}
{"id": 4420, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4421, "text": "So let me give you another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 4422, "text": "Actually, maybe I should erase.", "label": []}
{"id": 4423, "text": "Actually, I'm going to do that right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 4424, "text": "You'll approach the area under this curve, right, almost the exact area under this curve, and you'd also get almost the exact value of the distance after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds in this case, right? But <EXPRESSION> didn't have to be an exact number.", "label": []}
{"id": 4425, "text": "It's kind of the sum of each of these rectangles, but it's the limit, as if these were discrete rectangles, you could just do a sum, and you could make the rectangle bases smaller and smaller, and have more and more rectangles, and just do a regular sum.", "label": []}
{"id": 4426, "text": "It tells us area, and it also tells us the antiderivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 4427, "text": "Let me draw this twice, once for the distance, and once for its derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 4428, "text": "From <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4429, "text": "Right? We're already familiar with it as an antiderivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 4430, "text": "And actually, I want to show you why we do this subtraction.", "label": []}
{"id": 4431, "text": "And please look it up so you can see properly drawn integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 4432, "text": "But in this case, the indefinite integral is just saying, well, I'm going to take the sum from <EQUATION>, right, so from <EQUATION>, to let's say in this example, <EQUATION>, right, because I said <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4433, "text": "And then I asked a question.", "label": []}

{"id": 4577, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4578, "text": "But now we'll just mechanically compute because, actually, understanding it is a bit harder than just doing it.", "label": []}

{"id": 4606, "text": "We could figure out this area.", "label": []}
{"id": 4607, "text": "And this is why people tend to use this standard because we know that <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4608, "text": "And you could imagine, before you knew calculus, figuring out an area of something with a curve it's kind of top boundary.", "label": []}
{"id": 4609, "text": "And this is more algebra, so I won't go into that in too much detail.", "label": []}

{"id": 4615, "text": "It doesn't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 4616, "text": "But anyway, my question to you, or my question to myself, really, is what is the area between the curves where they intersect? What is this? What is this area?

{"id": 4646, "text": "Who knows, maybe it'll involve some you know a circle involves pi, which is this really messy number, so maybe all curves have these kind of messy areas.", "label": []}
{"id": 4647, "text": "The area under just the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4648, "text": "And then when <EQUATION> what is this expression =? Well that's easy too.", "label": []}
{"id": 4649, "text": "Let me do it in a loud color.", "label": []}
{"id": 4650, "text": "And we're going to evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4651, "text": "I just put <EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4652, "text": "Well I guess we could figure it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 4653, "text": "So instead of doing that, let's do the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4654, "text": "And we're going to have to evaluate this thing at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and subtract the difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 4655, "text": "Where I had just left off we were trying to figure out this area between these <EXPRESSION> curves, and we figured out that it's really the area between the curves between the point <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4656, "text": "And then we divide by this new exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 4657, "text": "Welcome back.", "label": []}
{"id": 4658, "text": "I mean, you might actually find this easy, but let's figure out the area between <EXPRESSION> = I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4659, "text": "You know I find is this of exciting because if just my intuition I was like, oh I have these <EXPRESSION> curves, and I mean they do intersect at the nice integer number, but you know what it's probably going to be some really messy number of what the areas between these <EXPRESSION> curves, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 4660, "text": "So I want to figure out this area inside the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 4661, "text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4662, "text": "I should have done something with an even exponent so I could have had this cup shape, but anyway the absolute value solved my problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 4663, "text": "So if I say <EQUATION>, I think you see where I realized my mistake.", "label": []}
{"id": 4664, "text": "This problem's a little hairy, just because I had a bad choice of initial function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4665, "text": "But I have committed so much to this cup shape that I'll make it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4666, "text": "Let's say I want to figure out the area inside of the curve where the height here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4667, "text": "Oh, and that's half of it, right? So we want to multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4668, "text": "And I don't know what that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 4669, "text": "But this <EXPRESSION> it's just <EXPRESSION> of those neat things about math.", "label": []}
{"id": 4670, "text": "I'm about to run out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4671, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4672, "text": "Exactly.", "label": []}
{"id": 4673, "text": "Actually that might be even simpler because when you evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> it simplify things a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 4674, "text": "This could have just been rewritten this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 4675, "text": "We raise it <EXPRESSION> more power so it becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4676, "text": "You could have said this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4677, "text": "How do we do that? Well <EXPRESSION> way we could do it is just like we did the last <EXPRESSION>, we can figure out some function that's essentially a line, a horizontal line that goes straight across here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4678, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4679, "text": "I think I'm running out of space.", "label": []}
{"id": 4680, "text": "And I was proposing of a way to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4681, "text": "It's the indefinite integral for <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of the top function, the top boundary, <EXPRESSION>, minus the bottom boundary.", "label": []}
{"id": 4682, "text": "Not exactly what I wanted, but we'll work on forward.", "label": []}
{"id": 4683, "text": "Because the mistake, obviously <EXPRESSION> is not a parabola looking thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4684, "text": "In fact, some people start this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 4685, "text": "So dividing by a fraction is like multiplying by its reciprocal.", "label": []}
{"id": 4686, "text": "But if I say <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, there's <EXPRESSION> places where that's true.", "label": []}
{"id": 4687, "text": "That's Kind of like the combined area.", "label": []}
{"id": 4688, "text": "You could just rewrite a new function, which is the difference of these <EXPRESSION> functions, and it would have been equivalent.", "label": []}
{"id": 4689, "text": "I'm going to do something simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 4690, "text": "Right, it was <EXPRESSION>, we added <EXPRESSION> to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4691, "text": "Subtract this expression evaluated at <EXPRESSION> from this expression evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4692, "text": "So if we multiply that by <EXPRESSION>, we get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4693, "text": "It's a bit of a trick problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 4694, "text": "And I want to subtract from that the area from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> what's under <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4695, "text": "It's going to go up real fast.", "label": []}
{"id": 4696, "text": "Actually let me do <EXPRESSION> more problem since I have time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4697, "text": "Well that's just from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, the integral of <EXPRESSION>, because <EXPRESSION> is the green function, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4698, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and the next is <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, so the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4699, "text": "So what is this area? We know it's between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so we just set up the indefinite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4700, "text": "I can multiply if I wanted to, but I have <EXPRESSION> seconds left so I'll leave you there.", "label": []}
{"id": 4701, "text": "So first of all we just have to figure out what the antiderivative of this inner expression is.", "label": []}
{"id": 4702, "text": "So you could do this <EXPRESSION> separate problems, <EXPRESSION> separate indefinite integrals, or you could do it as <EXPRESSION> indefinite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4703, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4704, "text": "So let's stick with the second one.", "label": []}
{"id": 4705, "text": "So just based on the last example we did, we could just write the indefinite integral, and I'm not going to rewrite the fundamental theorem from calculus, because I think you know that by now.", "label": []}
{"id": 4706, "text": "And we'll essentially just be figuring out the area between the <EXPRESSION> functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 4707, "text": "x to the fifth goes negative like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4708, "text": "And then we need to figure out what the area is between the <EXPRESSION>, so we need to figure out what are these <EXPRESSION> points.", "label": []}
{"id": 4709, "text": "Let's say that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4710, "text": "It just goes straight across.", "label": []}
{"id": 4711, "text": "Let's say that this is not = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4712, "text": "What happens when <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4713, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4714, "text": "That's the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4715, "text": "<EQUATION>, and actually, you know what? I made a mistake.", "label": []}
{"id": 4716, "text": "Let me draw it actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 4717, "text": "I haven't figured out what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 4718, "text": "These are the <EXPRESSION> points.", "label": []}
{"id": 4719, "text": "Well that's easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 4720, "text": "See those are the same thing as the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4721, "text": "So we could say <EQUATION>", "label": []}
{"id": 4722, "text": "So there you go.", "label": []}
{"id": 4723, "text": "Well, this will be a little bit tricky, but <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4724, "text": "So you haven't seen <EXPRESSION> yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 4725, "text": "So when does <EQUATION>? I mean you could solve it algebraically, you know, you could say <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4726, "text": "The area between the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is a pretty clean number.", "label": []}
{"id": 4727, "text": "x to the fifth is going to go up super fast, something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4728, "text": "Let's say I wanted to figure out the areas this side's going to go real fast too between that, and instead of figuring out the area between x-axis and that, <EXPRESSION>, I want to figure out the area between <EXPRESSION> and Instead of figuring out this bottom area, right? Like the normal problems we've done, we would figure out this type of area, you know, between <EXPRESSION> points.", "label": []}
{"id": 4729, "text": "Do you think you know how to do it? Well, I think you do.", "label": []}
{"id": 4730, "text": "OK, I'm going to draw the x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 4731, "text": "This isn't kind of a step of the problem, but you could have done it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 4732, "text": "So I want to know the larger area, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 4733, "text": "Magenta.", "label": []}
{"id": 4734, "text": "Let's say that = <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>, right? So we just use the same antiderivative rules we've always used.", "label": []}
{"id": 4735, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> and then minus I think the second term is pretty easy for you <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4736, "text": "It's just a constant function.", "label": []}
{"id": 4737, "text": "So let's now evaluate this definite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4738, "text": "This definite integral is from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4739, "text": "And now it should be clearer to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 4740, "text": "Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger.", "label": []}
{"id": 4741, "text": "I want to do it however it is least confusing to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 4742, "text": "How did I know to substitute <EQUATION>? Well because I say, well the derivative of this function is here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4743, "text": "But it's really the same thing as what we just did with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4744, "text": "And we are done.", "label": []}
{"id": 4745, "text": "So now let's take the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 4746, "text": "So let me do it with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4747, "text": "It's just I didn't formally do the substitution, but it's the exact same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4748, "text": "And then when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4749, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>, that's the same thing is <EXPRESSION> did that here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4750, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4751, "text": "And remember, how did I do this? What allowed me to treat this <EXPRESSION> just like an <EXPRESSION> or like a <EXPRESSION> when I did it with the substitution? Well I had its derivative sitting right here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4752, "text": "It's exactly the same with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4753, "text": "Well essentially we're just going to do the same thing, but we're going to do it with substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4754, "text": "But the way I always think about it is, well I have a cosine and a sin.", "label": []}
{"id": 4755, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4756, "text": "Because <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4757, "text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>? It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4758, "text": "That hopefully we've learned already.", "label": []}
{"id": 4759, "text": "And what we care about, we're defining the definite integral between <EXPRESSION>, which is roughly here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4760, "text": "So when I find du, this whole thing is going to end up being du, and let me show that to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 4761, "text": "So we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4762, "text": "I mean if this cube right here is <EXPRESSION>, then that looks about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4763, "text": "But it's good to be able to do it with substitution, helps you from making careless mistakes.", "label": []}
{"id": 4764, "text": "So if this is going from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION> going from? Well when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4765, "text": "Actually, let me do it with substitution, just because the way I was just doing is kind of my shortcut back in the day when I was a mathlete.", "label": []}
{"id": 4766, "text": "I have cosine of <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4767, "text": "I just wanted to show you that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4768, "text": "And now the fun part.", "label": []}
{"id": 4769, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4770, "text": "So if we erase all of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4771, "text": "And since the a curve is below the x-axis here, this area is going to be a negative number.", "label": []}
{"id": 4772, "text": "So I've graphed this function right here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4773, "text": "That was our original substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4774, "text": "And now this is a very important thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4775, "text": "And what was the chain rule? The chain rule said if I took the derivative of <EXPRESSION> that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4776, "text": "Well that's just the same thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4777, "text": "This is the derivative of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4778, "text": "So hopefully you found that vaguely useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 4779, "text": "So before we just chug through the math and do the antiderivatives and use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral, let's think about what we're even doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4780, "text": "So the antiderivative is <EXPRESSION>, and I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4781, "text": "Actually let me since we have a little bit of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 4782, "text": "So between <EXPRESSION> which is right there, and between <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4783, "text": "The cosine is squared, so all these crazy things are happening to it, so it seems like I could use substitution or the reverse chain rules some out here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4784, "text": "So let me rewrite this first of all.", "label": []}
{"id": 4785, "text": "Since the derivative is here, I can just treat this whole thing like an <EXPRESSION> term.", "label": []}
{"id": 4786, "text": "And if we look at this area from our original graph, what we just solved, as we said the area of the curve between here and here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4787, "text": "So we have the integral from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4788, "text": "The intuition all works out at least.", "label": []}
{"id": 4789, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the cosine of <EXPRESSION>, and then the derivative of <EXPRESSION> or the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4790, "text": "Transcript for: Definite integral with substitution So I've been sent this definite integral problem and it seemed as good as any, and I think the key with this is just to see a lot of examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 4791, "text": "And so if we have this integral right here, what I do is I say, well I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4792, "text": "Well it's actually <EXPRESSION>, and we have a minus sin here, so that works out well too.", "label": []}
{"id": 4793, "text": "Actually let me write that as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4794, "text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>? If we multiply both sides by the differential <EXPRESSION> get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4795, "text": "It's a little bit quicker sometimes.", "label": []}
{"id": 4796, "text": "This is pretty straightforward and I'm just going to rewrite it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4797, "text": "And now this seems like a simple problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 4798, "text": "All I did is I increased this exponent to get the third, and I divided by that exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 4799, "text": "That might completely confuse you, but I just wrote that here because we could say, well what if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4800, "text": "You could just take the derivative of this, you get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 4801, "text": "Hopefully you understood this, and if you did, don't worry about what I'm going to do now, but I want to show you how I tend to do it where I just think of it is the reverse chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 4802, "text": "Anyway, hope you found that helpful.", "label": []}
{"id": 4803, "text": "So we get the same answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 4804, "text": "This is the same thing as the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4805, "text": "And that looks about right, that looks about <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4806, "text": "So if we look at the original equation, this right here we just showed = <EXPRESSION>, and this right here is what? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4807, "text": "If this confuse you, ignore it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4808, "text": "So this is the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 4809, "text": "OK let me erase that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4810, "text": "So I have a function and it's being squared, and I have its derivative, so I can figure out its antiderivative by using substitution or the reverse chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 4811, "text": "So that gives us immediately an intuition.", "label": []}
{"id": 4812, "text": "Now we're going to have to evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and subtract from that, it evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4813, "text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>? <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4814, "text": "So let's make a substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 4815, "text": "And I will arbitrarily switch colors.", "label": []}
{"id": 4816, "text": "So let's do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 4817, "text": "So that's what gave me the license to just take the antiderivative, pretend like this <EXPRESSION> is just an <EXPRESSION>, is just a <EXPRESSION>, you could even say, and just take it's exponent, raise it by <EXPRESSION> and divide it by <EXPRESSION> and then evaluate it from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4818, "text": "Same thing, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 4819, "text": "Now I'll rearrange some of the terms here just to make it a little bit easier to read.", "label": []}
{"id": 4820, "text": "Or we could do the substitution and reverse the substitution and then evaluate the boundaries, but let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 4821, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, and so this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4822, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, well that's a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4823, "text": "If you're going to do substitution, if we're going to say <EQUATION>, we're going to have to actually make this substitution on the boundaries.", "label": []}
{"id": 4824, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>, which is fairly straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 4825, "text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4826, "text": "So the definite integral of this function between here and here is essentially the area of the curve between the curve and the x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 4827, "text": "We should be getting a negative number when we evaluate this and just to prove this I actually typed it in up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4828, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4829, "text": "Or if we wanted the absolute area because you can't really have a negative area, it's <EXPRESSION> but we know it's negative because this curve is below the x-axis here.", "label": []}
{"id": 4830, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so this = <EXPRESSION> minus this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 4831, "text": "Let me a erase this if this confuses people.", "label": []}
{"id": 4832, "text": "What's <EXPRESSION>? <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8328, "text": "Professor: So, we're ready to begin the fifth lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8329, "text": "I'm glad to be back.", "label": []}
{"id": 8330, "text": "Thank you for entertaining my colleague, Haynes Miller.", "label": []}
{"id": 8331, "text": "So, today we're going to continue where he started, namely what he talked about was the chain rule, which is probably the most powerful technique for extending the kinds of functions that you can differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8332, "text": "And we're going to use the chain rule in some rather clever algebraic ways today.", "label": []}
{"id": 8333, "text": "So the topic for today is what's known as implicit differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8334, "text": "So implicit differentiation is a technique that allows you to differentiate a lot of functions you didn't even know how to find before.", "label": []}
{"id": 8335, "text": "And it's a technique - let's wait for a few people to sit down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8336, "text": "Physics, huh?", "label": []}
{"id": 8337, "text": "Okay, more Physics.", "label": []}
{"id": 8338, "text": "Let's take a break.", "label": []}
{"id": 8339, "text": "You can get those after class.", "label": []}
{"id": 8340, "text": "All right, so we're talking about implicit differentiation, and I'm going to illustrate it by several examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 8341, "text": "So this is one of the most important and basic formulas that we've already covered part way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8342, "text": "Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8343, "text": "Now, what we've got so far is the exponents, <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "label": []}
{"id": 8344, "text": "You did the positive integer powers in the first lecture, and then yesterday Professor Miller told you about the negative powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8345, "text": "So what we're going to do right now, today, is we're going to consider the exponents which are rational numbers, ratios of integers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8346, "text": "So a is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8347, "text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are integers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8348, "text": "All right, so that's our goal for right now, and we're going to use this method of implicit differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8349, "text": "In particular, it's important to realize that this covers the case <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8350, "text": "And those are the nth roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 8351, "text": "So when we take the <EXPRESSION>, we're going to cover that right now, along with many other examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 8352, "text": "So this is our first example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8353, "text": "So how do we get started?", "label": []}
{"id": 8354, "text": "Well we just write down a formula for the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8355, "text": "The function is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8356, "text": "That's what we're trying to deal with.", "label": []}
{"id": 8357, "text": "And now there's really only two steps.", "label": []}
{"id": 8358, "text": "The first step is to take this equation to the nth power, so write it <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8359, "text": "Alright, so that's just the same equation re-written.", "label": []}
{"id": 8360, "text": "And now, what we're going to do is we're going to differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8361, "text": "So we're going to apply <EXPRESSION> to the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8362, "text": "Now why is it that we can apply it to the second equation, not the first equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 8363, "text": "So maybe I should call these equation <EXPRESSION> and equation <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8364, "text": "So, the point is, we can apply it to equation <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8365, "text": "Now, the reason is that we don't know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8366, "text": "That's something we just don't know yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 8367, "text": "But we do know how to differentiate integer powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8368, "text": "Those are the things that we took care of before.", "label": []}
{"id": 8369, "text": "So now we're in shape to be able to do the differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8370, "text": "So I'm going to write it out explicitly over here, without carrying it out just yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 8371, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8372, "text": "And now you see this expression here requires us to do something we couldn't do before yesterday.", "label": []}
{"id": 8373, "text": "Namely, this <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8374, "text": "So we have to apply the chain rule here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8375, "text": "So this is the same as - this is by the chain rule now - <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8376, "text": "And then, on the right hand side, we can just carry it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8377, "text": "We know the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8378, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8379, "text": "Right, now this is our scheme.", "label": []}
{"id": 8380, "text": "And you'll see in a minute why we win with this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8381, "text": "So, first of all, there are two factors here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8382, "text": "One of them is unknown.", "label": []}
{"id": 8383, "text": "In fact, it's what we're looking for.", "label": []}
{"id": 8384, "text": "But the other one is going to be a known quantity, because we know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8385, "text": "That's the same formula, although the letter has been changed.", "label": []}
{"id": 8386, "text": "And so this is the same as - I'll write it underneath here - <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8387, "text": "Okay, now comes, if you like, the non-calculus part of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8388, "text": "Remember the non-calculus part of the problem is always the messier part of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8389, "text": "So we want to figure out this formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8390, "text": "This formula, the answer over here, which maybe I'll put in a box now, has this expressed much more simply, only in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8391, "text": "And what we have to do now is just solve for <EXPRESSION> using algebra, and then solve all the way in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8392, "text": "So, first of all, we solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8393, "text": "So I do that by dividing the factor on the left-hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 8394, "text": "So I get here <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8395, "text": "And now I'm going to plug in-- so I'll write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8396, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8397, "text": "Now over here I'm going to put in for <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8398, "text": "So now we're almost done, but unfortunately we have this mess of exponents that we have to work out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8399, "text": "I'm going to write it one more time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8400, "text": "So I already recognize the factor a out front.", "label": []}
{"id": 8401, "text": "That's not going to be a problem for me, and that's what I'm aiming for here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8402, "text": "But now I have to encode all of these powers, so let's just write it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8403, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and then it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8404, "text": "All right, so that's the law of exponents applied to this ratio here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8405, "text": "And then we'll do the arithmetic over here on the next board.", "label": []}
{"id": 8406, "text": "So we have here <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8407, "text": "And if I multiply n by this, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8408, "text": "And if the second factor is minus minus, that's a plus.", "label": []}
{"id": 8409, "text": "And that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8410, "text": "Altogether the two m's cancel.", "label": []}
{"id": 8411, "text": "I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8412, "text": "And lo and behold that's the same thing as a <EXPRESSION>, just what we wanted.", "label": []}
{"id": 8413, "text": "All right, so this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8414, "text": "Okay, again just a bunch of arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 8415, "text": "From this point forward, from this substitution on, it's just the arithmetic of exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8416, "text": "All right, so we've done our first example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8417, "text": "I want to give you a couple more examples, so let's just continue.", "label": []}
{"id": 8418, "text": "The next example I'll keep relatively simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 8419, "text": "So we have example two, which is going to be the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8420, "text": "Well, that's not really a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8421, "text": "It's a way of defining y as a function of x implicitly.", "label": []}
{"id": 8422, "text": "There's the idea that I could solve for y if I wanted to.", "label": []}
{"id": 8423, "text": "And indeed let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8424, "text": "So if you solve for y here, what happens is you get <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8425, "text": "So this, if you like, is the implicit definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 8426, "text": "And here is the explicit function <EXPRESSION>, which is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8427, "text": "And now just for my own convenience, I'm just going to take the positive branch.", "label": []}
{"id": 8428, "text": "This is the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8429, "text": "It's just really a circle in disguise.", "label": []}
{"id": 8430, "text": "And I'm just going to take the top part of the circle, so we'll take that top hump here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8431, "text": "All right, so that means I'm erasing this minus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 8432, "text": "I'm just taking the positive branch, just for my convenience.", "label": []}
{"id": 8433, "text": "I could do it just as well with the negative branch.", "label": []}
{"id": 8434, "text": "Alright, so now I've taken the solution, and I can differentiate with this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8435, "text": "So rather than using the <EXPRESSION> notation over here, I'm going to switch notations over here, because it's less writing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8436, "text": "I'm going to write y' and change notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 8437, "text": "Okay, so I want to take the derivative of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8438, "text": "Well this is a somewhat complicated function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8439, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and the right way always to look at functions like this is to rewrite them using the fractional power notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8440, "text": "That's the first step in computing a derivative of a square root.", "label": []}
{"id": 8441, "text": "And then the second step here is what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8442, "text": "Does somebody want to tell me?", "label": []}
{"id": 8443, "text": "Chain rule, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8444, "text": "That's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8445, "text": "So we have two things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8446, "text": "We start with one, and then we do something else to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8447, "text": "So whenever we do two things to something, we need to apply the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8448, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8449, "text": "All right, so how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8450, "text": "Well, the first factor I claim is the derivative of this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8451, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> blah to the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8452, "text": "So I'm doing this kind of by the advanced method now, because we've already graduated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8453, "text": "You already did the chain rule last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8454, "text": "So what does this mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 8455, "text": "This is an abbreviation for the derivative with respect to blah of blah <EXPRESSION>, whatever it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8456, "text": "All right, so that's the first factor that we're going to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 8457, "text": "Rather than actually write out a variable for it and pass through as I did previously with this <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> variable here, I'm just going to skip that step and let you imagine it as being a placeholder for that variable here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8458, "text": "So this variable is now parenthesis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8459, "text": "And then I have to multiply that by the rate of change of what's inside with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8460, "text": "And that is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8461, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8462, "text": "And now again, we couldn't have done this example two before example one, because we needed to know that the power rule worked not just for a integer but also for <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8463, "text": "We're using the case <EQUATION> right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8464, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION> times, and this <EXPRESSION> here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8465, "text": "- So this is the case <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8466, "text": "<EXPRESSION> happens to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8467, "text": "Okay, so I'm putting all those things together.", "label": []}
{"id": 8468, "text": "And you know within a week you have to be doing this very automatically.", "label": []}
{"id": 8469, "text": "So we're going to do it at this speed now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8470, "text": "You want to do it even faster, ultimately.", "label": []}
{"id": 8471, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8472, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: The question is could I have done it implicitly without the square roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 8473, "text": "And the answer is yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8474, "text": "That's what I'm about to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 8475, "text": "So this is an illustration of what's called the explicit solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8476, "text": "So this guy is what's called explicit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8477, "text": "And I want to contrast it with the method that we're going to now use today.", "label": []}
{"id": 8478, "text": "So it involves a lot of complications.", "label": []}
{"id": 8479, "text": "It involves the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8480, "text": "And as we'll see it can get messier and messier.", "label": []}
{"id": 8481, "text": "And then there's the implicit method, which I claim is easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 8482, "text": "So let's see what happens if you do it implicitly The implicit method involves, instead of writing the function in this relatively complicated way, with the square root, it involves leaving it alone.", "label": []}
{"id": 8483, "text": "Don't do anything to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8484, "text": "In this previous case, we were left with something which was complicated, say <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or something complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8485, "text": "We had to simplify it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8486, "text": "We had an equation one, which was more complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8487, "text": "We simplified it then differentiated it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8488, "text": "And so that was a simpler case.", "label": []}
{"id": 8489, "text": "Well here, the simplest thing us to differentiate is the one we started with, because squares are practically the easiest thing after first powers, or maybe zeroth powers to differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8490, "text": "So we're leaving it alone.", "label": []}
{"id": 8491, "text": "This is the simplest possible form for it, and now we're going to differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8492, "text": "So what happens?", "label": []}
{"id": 8493, "text": "So again what's the method?", "label": []}
{"id": 8494, "text": "Let me remind you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8495, "text": "You're applying <EXPRESSION> to the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8496, "text": "So you have to differentiate the left side of the equation, and differentiate the right side of the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8497, "text": "So it's this, and what you get is <EXPRESSION> = what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8498, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8499, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8500, "text": "So this is the chain rule again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8501, "text": "I did it a different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8502, "text": "I'm trying to get you used to many different notations at once.", "label": []}
{"id": 8503, "text": "Well really just two.", "label": []}
{"id": 8504, "text": "Just the prime notation and the <EXPRESSION> notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8505, "text": "And this is what I get.", "label": []}
{"id": 8506, "text": "So now all I have to do is solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8507, "text": "So that <EXPRESSION>, if I put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side, is <EXPRESSION>, and then divide by <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8508, "text": "So let's compare our solutions, and I'll apologize, I'm going to have to erase something to do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8509, "text": "So let's compare our two solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8510, "text": "I'm going to put this underneath and simplify.", "label": []}
{"id": 8511, "text": "So what was our solution over here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8512, "text": "It was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8513, "text": "That was what we got over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8514, "text": "And that is the same thing, if I cancel the 2's, and I change it back to looking like a square root, that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8515, "text": "So this is the formula for the derivative when I do it the explicit way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8516, "text": "And I'll just compare them, these two expressions here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8517, "text": "And notice they are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 8518, "text": "They're the same, because <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8519, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 8520, "text": "Question?", "label": []}
{"id": 8521, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: The question is why did the implicit method not give the bottom half of the circle?", "label": []}
{"id": 8522, "text": "Very good question.", "label": []}
{"id": 8523, "text": "The answer to that is that it did.", "label": []}
{"id": 8524, "text": "I just didn't mention it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8525, "text": "Wait, I'll explain.", "label": []}
{"id": 8526, "text": "So suppose I stuck in a minus sign here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8527, "text": "I would have gotten this with the difference, so with an extra minus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 8528, "text": "But then when I compared it to what was over there, I would have had to have another different minus sign over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8529, "text": "So actually both places would get an extra minus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 8530, "text": "And they would still coincide.", "label": []}
{"id": 8531, "text": "So actually the implicit method is a little better.", "label": []}
{"id": 8532, "text": "It doesn't even notice the difference between the branches.", "label": []}
{"id": 8533, "text": "It does the job on both the top and bottom half.", "label": []}
{"id": 8534, "text": "Another way of saying that is that you're calculating the slopes here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8535, "text": "So let's look at this picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8536, "text": "Here's a slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8537, "text": "Let's just take a look at a positive value of <EXPRESSION> and just check the sign to see what's happening.", "label": []}
{"id": 8538, "text": "If you take a positive value of <EXPRESSION> over here, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8539, "text": "This denominator is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8540, "text": "The slope is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8541, "text": "You can see that it's tilting down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8542, "text": "So it's okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 8543, "text": "Now on the bottom side, it's going to be tilting up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8544, "text": "And similarly what's happening up here is that both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, and this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> are positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8545, "text": "And the slope is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8546, "text": "On the other hand, on the bottom side,  is still positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8547, "text": "And it's tilting up because the denominator is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8548, "text": "The numerator is positive, and this minus sign has a positive slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8549, "text": "So it matches perfectly in every category.", "label": []}
{"id": 8550, "text": "This complicated, however, and it's easier just to keep track of one branch at a time, even in advanced math.", "label": []}
{"id": 8551, "text": "Okay, so we only do it one branch at a time.", "label": []}
{"id": 8552, "text": "Other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 8553, "text": "Okay, so now I want to give you a slightly more complicated example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8554, "text": "And indeed some of the-- so here's a little more complicated example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8555, "text": "It's not going to be the most complicated example, but you know it'll be a little tricky.", "label": []}
{"id": 8556, "text": "So this example, I'm going to give you a fourth order equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8557, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8558, "text": "Now it just so happens that there's a trick to solving this equation, so actually you can do both the explicit method and the non-explicit method.", "label": []}
{"id": 8559, "text": "So the explicit method would say okay well, I want to solve for this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8560, "text": "So I'm going to use the quadratic formula, but on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8561, "text": "This is quadratic in <EXPRESSION>, because there's a fourth power and a second power, and the first and third powers are missing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8562, "text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8563, "text": "And so this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8564, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, and <EQUATION> in the quadratic formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8565, "text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8566, "text": "So now you can see this problem of branches, this happens actually in a lot of cases, coming up in an elaborate way.", "label": []}
{"id": 8567, "text": "You have two choices for the sign here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8568, "text": "You have two choices for the sign here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8569, "text": "Conceivably as many as four roots for this equation, because it's a fourth degree equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8570, "text": "It's quite a mess.", "label": []}
{"id": 8571, "text": "You should have to check each branch separately.", "label": []}
{"id": 8572, "text": "And this really is that level of complexity, and in general it's very difficult to figure out the formulas for quartic equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 8573, "text": "But fortunately we're never going to use them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8574, "text": "That is, we're never going to need those formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 8575, "text": "So the implicit method is far easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 8576, "text": "The implicit method just says okay I'll leave the equation in its simplest form.", "label": []}
{"id": 8577, "text": "And now differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8578, "text": "So when I differentiate, I get <EXPRESSION> plus - now here I have to apply the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8579, "text": "So I differentiate the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> separately.", "label": []}
{"id": 8580, "text": "First I differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION>, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8581, "text": "Then I differentiate with respect to the other factor, the <EXPRESSION> factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 8582, "text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8583, "text": "And then the <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8584, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8585, "text": "So there's the implicit differentiation step.", "label": []}
{"id": 8586, "text": "And now I just want to solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8587, "text": "So I'm going to factor out <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8588, "text": "That's the factor on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8589, "text": "And I'm going to put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 8590, "text": "<EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8591, "text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8592, "text": "So that's the formula for the solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8593, "text": "For the slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8594, "text": "You have a question?", "label": []}
{"id": 8595, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is for the y would we have to put in what solved for in the explicit equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8596, "text": "And the answer is absolutely yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8597, "text": "That's exactly the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8598, "text": "So this is not a complete solution to a problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8599, "text": "We started with an implicit equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8600, "text": "We differentiated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8601, "text": "And we got in the end, also an implicit equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8602, "text": "It doesn't tell us what <EXPRESSION> is as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8603, "text": "You have to go back to this formula to get the formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8604, "text": "So for example, let me give you an example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8605, "text": "So this hides a degree of complexity of the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8606, "text": "But it's a degree of complexity that we must live with.", "label": []}
{"id": 8607, "text": "So for example, at <EQUATION>, you can see that <EQUATION> solves.", "label": []}
{"id": 8608, "text": "That happens to be-- solves <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8609, "text": "That's why I picked the <EXPRESSION> actually, so it would be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8610, "text": "I just wanted to have a convenient solution there to pull out of my hat at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8611, "text": "So I did that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8612, "text": "And so we now know that when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8613, "text": "So at (1, 1) along the curve, the slope = what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8614, "text": "Well, I have to plug in here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8615, "text": "That's just plugging in that formula over there, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8616, "text": "So I can get it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8617, "text": "On the other hand, at say <EQUATION>, we're stuck using this formula star here to find <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8618, "text": "Now, so let me just make two points about this, which are just philosophical points for you right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8619, "text": "The first is, when I promised you at the beginning of this class that we were going to be able to differentiate any function you know, I meant it very literally.", "label": []}
{"id": 8620, "text": "What I meant is if you know the function, we'll be able give a formula for the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8621, "text": "If you don't know how to find a function, you'll have a lot of trouble finding the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8622, "text": "So we didn't make any promises that if you can't find the function you will be able to find the derivative by some magic.", "label": []}
{"id": 8623, "text": "That will never happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 8624, "text": "And however complex the function is, a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients, we're stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8625, "text": "But the big advantage of his method, notice, is that although we've had to find star, we had to find this formula star, and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically, by the way, which we'll learn later, so there's a good method for doing it numerically.", "label": []}
{"id": 8626, "text": "Although we had to find star, we never had to differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8627, "text": "We had a fast way of getting the slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8628, "text": "So we had to know what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were.", "label": []}
{"id": 8629, "text": "But <EXPRESSION> we got by an algebraic formula, in terms of the values here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8630, "text": "So this is very fast, forgetting the slope, once you know the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8631, "text": "yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 8632, "text": "Student: What's in the parentheses?", "label": []}
{"id": 8633, "text": "Professor: Sorry, this is-- Well let's see if I can manage this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8634, "text": "Is this the parentheses you're talking about?", "label": []}
{"id": 8635, "text": "Ah, \"say\".", "label": []}
{"id": 8636, "text": "That says \"say\".", "label": []}
{"id": 8637, "text": "Well, so maybe I should put commas around it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8638, "text": "But it was S A Y, comma comma, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 8639, "text": "Well here was at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8640, "text": "I'm just throwing out a value.", "label": []}
{"id": 8641, "text": "Any other value.", "label": []}
{"id": 8642, "text": "Actually there is one value, my favorite value.", "label": []}
{"id": 8643, "text": "Well this is easy to evaluate right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8644, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, I can do it there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8645, "text": "That's maybe the only one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8646, "text": "The others are a nuisance.", "label": []}
{"id": 8647, "text": "All right, other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 8648, "text": "Now we have to do something more here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8649, "text": "So I claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know.", "label": []}
{"id": 8650, "text": "But really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at.", "label": []}
{"id": 8651, "text": "So this implicit differentiation method has one very, very important application to finding inverse functions, or finding derivatives of inverse functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8652, "text": "So let's talk about that next.", "label": []}
{"id": 8653, "text": "So first, maybe we'll just illustrate by an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8654, "text": "If you have the function <EXPRESSION>, for <EXPRESSION> positive, then of course this idea is that we should simplify this equation and we should square it so we get this somewhat simpler equation here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8655, "text": "And then we have a notation for this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8656, "text": "If we call <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, this is the reversal of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8657, "text": "Then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is that it should be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8658, "text": "And in general, if we start with any old <EQUATION>, and we just write down, this is the defining relationship for a function <EXPRESSION>, the property that we're saying is that <EXPRESSION> has got to bring us back to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8659, "text": "And we write that in a couple of different ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 8660, "text": "We call <EXPRESSION> the inverse of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8661, "text": "And also we call <EXPRESSION> the inverse of <EXPRESSION>, although I'm going to be silent about which variable I want to use, because people mix them up a little bit, as we'll be doing when we draw some pictures of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8662, "text": "So let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8663, "text": "Let's draw pictures of both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> on the same graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8664, "text": "So first of all, I'm going to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8665, "text": "That's some shape like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8666, "text": "And now, in order to understand what <EXPRESSION> is, so let's do the analysis in general, but then we'll draw it in this particular case.", "label": []}
{"id": 8667, "text": "If you have <EQUATION>, that's really just the same equation right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8668, "text": "This is the equation <EQUATION>, that's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8669, "text": "This is <EQUATION>, those are the same equations, it's the same curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 8670, "text": "But suppose now that we wanted to write down what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8671, "text": "In other words, we wanted to switch the variables, so draw them as I said on the same graph with the same <EXPRESSION>, and the same <EXPRESSION> axes.", "label": []}
{"id": 8672, "text": "Then that would be, in effect, trading the roles of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8673, "text": "We have to rename every point on the graph which is the ordered pair (x, y), and trade it for the opposite one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8674, "text": "And when you exchange <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so to do this, exchange <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and when you do that, graphically what that looks like is the following: suppose you have a place here, and this is the <EXPRESSION> and this is the <EXPRESSION>, then you want to trade them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8675, "text": "So you want the y here right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8676, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8677, "text": "It's sort of the opposite place over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8678, "text": "And that is the place which is directly opposite this point across the diagonal line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8679, "text": "So you reflect across this or you flip across that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8680, "text": "You get this other shape that looks like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8681, "text": "Maybe I'll draw it with a colored piece of chalk here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8682, "text": "So this guy here is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8683, "text": "And indeed, if you look at these graphs, this one is the square root.", "label": []}
{"id": 8684, "text": "This one happens to be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8685, "text": "If you take this one, and you turn it, you reverse the roles of the x axis and the y axis, and tilt it on its side.", "label": []}
{"id": 8686, "text": "So that's the picture of what an inverse function is, and now I want to show you that the method of implicit differentiation allows us to compute the derivatives of inverse functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8687, "text": "So let me just say it in general, and then I'll carry it out in particular.", "label": []}
{"id": 8688, "text": "So implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of any inverse function, provided we know the derivative of the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8689, "text": "So let's do that for what is an example, which is truly complicated and a little subtle here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8690, "text": "It has a very pretty answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 8691, "text": "So we'll carry out an example here, which is the function <EXPRESSION> is = the inverse tangent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8692, "text": "So again, for the inverse tangent all of the things that we're going to do are going to be based on simplifying this equation by taking the tangent of both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 8693, "text": "So, us let me remind you by the way, the inverse tangent is what's also known as arctangent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8694, "text": "That's just another notation for the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8695, "text": "And what we're going to use to describe this function is the equation tan <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8696, "text": "That's what happens when you take the tangent of this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8697, "text": "This is how we're going to figure out what the function looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8698, "text": "So first of all, I want to draw it, and then we'll do the computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8699, "text": "So let's make the diagram first.", "label": []}
{"id": 8700, "text": "So I want to do something which is analogous to what I did over here with the square root function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8701, "text": "So first of all, I remind you that the tangent function is defined between two values here, which are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8702, "text": "And it starts out at minus infinity and curves up like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8703, "text": "So that's the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8704, "text": "And so the one that we have to sketch is this one which we get by reflecting this across the axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8705, "text": "Well not the axis, the diagonal.", "label": []}
{"id": 8706, "text": "This slope by the way, should be less - a little lower here so that we can have it going down and up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8707, "text": "So let me show you what it looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8708, "text": "On the front, it's going to look a lot like this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8709, "text": "So this one had curved down, and so the reflection across the diagonal curved up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8710, "text": "Here this is curving up, so the reflection is going to curve down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8711, "text": "It's going to look like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8712, "text": "Maybe I should, sorry, let's use a different color, because it's reversed from before.", "label": []}
{"id": 8713, "text": "I'll just call it green.", "label": []}
{"id": 8714, "text": "Now, the original curve in the first quadrant eventually had an asymptote which was straight up.", "label": []}
{"id": 8715, "text": "So this one is going to have an asymptote which is horizontal.", "label": []}
{"id": 8716, "text": "And that level is what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8717, "text": "What's the highest?", "label": []}
{"id": 8718, "text": "It is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8719, "text": "Now similarly, the other way, we're going to do this: and this bottom level is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8720, "text": "So there's the picture of this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8721, "text": "It's defined for all <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8722, "text": "So this green guy is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8723, "text": "And it's defined all the way from minus infinity to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 8724, "text": "And to use a notation that we had from limit notation as x goes to infinity, let's say, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8725, "text": "That's an example of one value that's of interest in addition to the finite values.", "label": []}
{"id": 8726, "text": "Okay, so now the first ingredient that we're going to need, is we're going to need the derivative of the tangent function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8727, "text": "So I'm going to recall for you, and maybe you haven't worked this out yet, but I hope that many of you have, that if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8728, "text": "So this you do by the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8729, "text": "So this is of the form <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8730, "text": "You use the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8731, "text": "So I'm going to get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8732, "text": "But what you get in the end is some marvelous simplification that comes out to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8733, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8734, "text": "You can recognize <EXPRESSION> from the fact that you should get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, and somehow the numerators all cancel and simplifies to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8735, "text": "This is also known as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8736, "text": "So that something that if you haven't done yet, you're going to have to do this as an exercise.", "label": []}
{"id": 8737, "text": "So we need that ingredient, and now we're just going to differentiate our equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8738, "text": "And what do we get?", "label": []}
{"id": 8739, "text": "We get, again, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8740, "text": "Or, if you like, <EXPRESSION> times, in the other notation, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8741, "text": "So I've just used the formulas that I just wrote down there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8742, "text": "Now all I have to do is solve for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8743, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8744, "text": "Unfortunately, this is not the form that we ever want to leave these things in.", "label": []}
{"id": 8745, "text": "This is the same problem we had with that ugly square root expression, or with any of the others.", "label": []}
{"id": 8746, "text": "We want to rewrite in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8747, "text": "Our original question was what is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8748, "text": "Now so far we have the following answer to that question: it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8749, "text": "Now this is a correct answer, but way too complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8750, "text": "Now that doesn't mean that if you took a random collection of functions, you wouldn't end up with something this complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 8751, "text": "But these particular functions, these beautiful circular functions involved with trigonometry all have very nice formulas associated with them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8752, "text": "And this simplifies tremendously.", "label": []}
{"id": 8753, "text": "So one of the skills that you need to develop when you're dealing with trig functions is to simplify this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8754, "text": "And so let's see now that expressions like this all simplify.", "label": []}
{"id": 8755, "text": "So here we go.", "label": []}
{"id": 8756, "text": "There's only one formula, one ingredient that we need to use to do this, and then we're going to draw a diagram.", "label": []}
{"id": 8757, "text": "So the ingredient again, is the original defining relationship that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8758, "text": "So <EQUATION> can be encoded in a right triangle in the following way: here's the right triangle and <EXPRESSION> means that <EXPRESSION> should be represented as an angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 8759, "text": "And then, its tangent is the ratio of this vertical to this horizontal side.", "label": []}
{"id": 8760, "text": "So I'm just going to pick two values that work, namely <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8761, "text": "Those are the simplest ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 8762, "text": "So I've encoded this equation in this picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 8763, "text": "And now all I have to do is figure out what the <EXPRESSION> is in this right triangle here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8764, "text": "In order to do that, I need to figure out what the hypotenuse is, but that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8765, "text": "And now I can read off what the <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8766, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> divided by the hypotenuse.", "label": []}
{"id": 8767, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> over square root, whoops, yeah, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8768, "text": "And so <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8769, "text": "And so our answer over here, the preferred answer which is way simpler than what I wrote up there, is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8770, "text": "Maybe I'll stop here for one more question.", "label": []}
{"id": 8771, "text": "I have one more calculation which I can do even in less than a minute.", "label": []}
{"id": 8772, "text": "So we have a whole minute for questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8773, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 8774, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: What happens to the inverse tangent?", "label": []}
{"id": 8775, "text": "The inverse tangent-- Okay, this inverse tangent is the same as this <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8776, "text": "Those are the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8777, "text": "So what I did was I skipped this step here entirely.", "label": []}
{"id": 8778, "text": "I never wrote that down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8779, "text": "But the inverse tangent was that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8780, "text": "The issue was what's a good formula for <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8781, "text": "So I am evaluating that, but I'm doing it using the letter <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8782, "text": "So in other words, what happened to the inverse tangent is that I called it <EXPRESSION>, which is what it's been all along.", "label": []}
{"id": 8783, "text": "Okay, so now I'm going to do the case of the <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8784, "text": "And I'll show you how easy this is if I don't fuss with-- because this one has an easy trig identity associated with it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8785, "text": "So if <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, and now watch how simple it is when I do the differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8786, "text": "I just differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8787, "text": "I get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8788, "text": "And then, <EXPRESSION>, so that implies that = <EXPRESSION>, and now to rewrite that in terms of <EXPRESSION>, I have to just recognize that this is the same as this, which is the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8789, "text": "So all told, the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8790, "text": "So these implicit differentiations are very convenient.", "label": []}
{"id": 8791, "text": "However, I warn you that you do have to be careful about the range of applicability of these things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8792, "text": "You have to draw a picture like this one to make sure you know where this makes sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 8793, "text": "In other words, you have to pick a branch for the sine function to work that out, and there's something like that on your problem set.", "label": []}
{"id": 8794, "text": "And it's also discussed in your text.", "label": []}
{"id": 8795, "text": "So we'll stop here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8796, "text": "- [Voiceover] Let's now introduce ourselves to the idea of a differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8797, "text": "And as we'll see, differential equations are super useful for modeling and simulating phenomena and understanding how they operate.", "label": []}
{"id": 8798, "text": "But we'll get into that later.", "label": []}
{"id": 8799, "text": "For now let's just think about or at least look at what a differential equation actually is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8800, "text": "So if I were to write, so let's see here is an example of differential equation, if I were to write that the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of <EQUATION>, this right over here is a differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8801, "text": "Another way we could write it if we said that <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, we could write this in function notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8802, "text": "We could write the second derivative of our function with respect to <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of our function = <EXPRESSION> times our function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8803, "text": "Or if we wanted to use the Leibniz notation, we could also write, the second derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8804, "text": "All three of these equations are really representing the same thing, they're saying OK, can I find functions where the second derivative of the function plus <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative of the function = <EXPRESSION> times the function itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 8805, "text": "So just to be clear, these are all essentially saying the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8806, "text": "And you might have just caught from how I described it that the solution to a differential equation is a function, or a class of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8807, "text": "It's not just a value or a set of values.", "label": []}
{"id": 8808, "text": "So the solution here, so the solution to a differential equation is a function, or a set of functions, or a class of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8809, "text": "It's important to contrast this relative to a traditional equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8810, "text": "So let me write that down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8811, "text": "So a traditional equation, maybe I shouldn't say traditional equation, differential equations have been around for a while.", "label": []}
{"id": 8812, "text": "So let me write this as maybe an algebraic equation that you're familiar with.", "label": []}
{"id": 8813, "text": "An algebraic equation might look something like, and I'll just write up a simple quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 8814, "text": "Say <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8815, "text": "The solutions to this algebraic equation are going to be numbers, or a set of numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8816, "text": "We can solve this, it's going to be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8817, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> could be = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> could be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8818, "text": "The solutions here are numbers, or a set of values that satisfy the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8819, "text": "Here it's a relationship between a function and its derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8820, "text": "And so the solutions, or the solution, is going to be a function or a set of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8821, "text": "Now let's make that a little more tangible.", "label": []}
{"id": 8822, "text": "What would a solution to something like any of these three, which really represent the same thing, what would a solution actually look like?", "label": []}
{"id": 8823, "text": "Actually let me move this over a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8824, "text": "Move this over a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8825, "text": "So we can take a look at what some of these solutions could look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8826, "text": "Let me erase this a little.", "label": []}
{"id": 8827, "text": "This little stuff that I have right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8828, "text": "So I'm just gonna give you examples of solutions here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8829, "text": "We'll verify that these indeed are solutions for I guess this is really just one differential equation represented in different ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 8830, "text": "But you'll hopefully appreciate what a solution to a differential equation looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8831, "text": "And that there is often more than one solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8832, "text": "There's a whole class of functions that could be a solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8833, "text": "So one solution to this differential equation, and I'll just write it as our first one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8834, "text": "So one solution, I'll call it y one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8835, "text": "And I could even write it as <EXPRESSION> to make it explicit that it is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8836, "text": "One solutions is <EQUATION> to the <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8837, "text": "And I encourage you to pause this video right now and find the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>, and verify that it does indeed satisfy this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8838, "text": "So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8839, "text": "So let's work through this together.", "label": []}
{"id": 8840, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8841, "text": "So the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>, so we just have to do the chain rule here, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8842, "text": "And the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8843, "text": "And if we take the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>, this = the same exact idea, the derivative of this is <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8844, "text": "And now we could just substitute these values into the differential equation, or these expressions into the differential equation to verify that this is indeed going to be true for this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8845, "text": "So let's verify that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8846, "text": "So we first have the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8847, "text": "So that's that term right over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8848, "text": "So we have <EXPRESSION> times the first derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8849, "text": "So that's going to be <EXPRESSION> times this right over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8850, "text": "So it's going to be <EXPRESSION>, I'll just write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8851, "text": "Notice I just took this two times the first derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8852, "text": "<EXPRESSION> times the first derivative is going to be =, or needs to be =, if this indeed does satisfy, if <EXPRESSION> does indeed satisfy the differential equation, this needs to be = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8853, "text": "Well <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8854, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8855, "text": "Let's see if that indeed is true.", "label": []}
{"id": 8856, "text": "So these <EXPRESSION> terms right over here, <EXPRESSION>, essentially <EXPRESSION>, that's gonna be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8857, "text": "Which is indeed = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8858, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is indeed a solution to this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8859, "text": "But as we'll see, it is not the only solution to this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8860, "text": "For example, let's say <EQUATION> is also a solution to this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8861, "text": "And I encourage you to pause the video again and verify that it's a solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8862, "text": "So assuming you've had a go at it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8863, "text": "So the first derivative of this is pretty straight-forward, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8864, "text": "Second derivative, one of the profound things of the exponential function, the second derivative here is also <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8865, "text": "So the second derivative, let me just do it in those same colors.", "label": []}
{"id": 8866, "text": "So the second derivative is going to be <EXPRESSION> is indeed going to be = to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8867, "text": "This is absolutely going to be true.", "label": []}
{"id": 8868, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8869, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is also a solution to this differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8870, "text": "So that's a start.", "label": []}
{"id": 8871, "text": "In the next few videos, we'll explore this more.", "label": []}
{"id": 8872, "text": "We'll start to see what the solutions look like, what classes of solutions are, techniques for solving them, visualizing solutions to differential equations, and a whole toolkit for kind of digging in deeper.", "label": []}
{"id": 8873, "text": "Professor: So, again welcome to 18.", "label": []}
{"id": 8874, "text": "01.", "label": []}
{"id": 8875, "text": "We're getting started today with what we're calling Unit One, a highly imaginative title.", "label": []}
{"id": 8876, "text": "And it's differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8877, "text": "So, let me first tell you, briefly, what's in store in the next couple of weeks.", "label": []}
{"id": 8878, "text": "The main topic today is what is a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8879, "text": "And, we're going to look at this from several different points of view, and the first one is the geometric interpretation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8880, "text": "That's what we'll spend most of today on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8881, "text": "And then, we'll also talk about a physical interpretation of what a derivative is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8882, "text": "And then there's going to be something else which I guess is maybe the reason why Calculus is so fundamental, and why we always start with it in most science and engineering schools, which is the importance of derivatives, of this, to all measurements.", "label": []}
{"id": 8883, "text": "So that means pretty much every place.", "label": []}
{"id": 8884, "text": "That means in science, in engineering, in economics, in political science, etc.", "label": []}
{"id": 8885, "text": "Polling, lots of commercial applications, just about everything.", "label": []}
{"id": 8886, "text": "Now, that's what we'll be getting started with, and then there's another thing that we're gonna do in this unit, which is we're going to explain how to differentiate anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 8887, "text": "So, how to differentiate any function you know.", "label": []}
{"id": 8888, "text": "And that's kind of a tall order, but let me just give you an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8889, "text": "If you want to take the derivative - this we'll see today is the notation for the derivative of something - of some messy function like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8890, "text": "We'll work this out by the end of this unit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8891, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8892, "text": "Anything you can think of, anything you can write down, we can differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8893, "text": "All right, so that's what we're gonna do, and today, as I said, we're gonna spend most of our time on this geometric interpretation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8894, "text": "So let's begin with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8895, "text": "So here we go with the geometric interpretation of derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8896, "text": "And, what we're going to do is just ask the geometric problem of finding the tangent line to some graph of some function at some point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8897, "text": "Which is to say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8898, "text": "So that's the problem that we're addressing here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8899, "text": "Alright, so here's our problem, and now let me show you the solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8900, "text": "So, well, let's graph the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8901, "text": "Here's its graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 8902, "text": "Here's some point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8903, "text": "All right, maybe I should draw it just a bit lower.", "label": []}
{"id": 8904, "text": "So here's a point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8905, "text": "Maybe it's above the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8906, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, by the way, this was supposed to be an <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8907, "text": "That was some fixed place on the x-axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 8908, "text": "And now, in order to perform this mighty feat, I will use another color of chalk.", "label": []}
{"id": 8909, "text": "How about red?", "label": []}
{"id": 8910, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 8911, "text": "So here it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8912, "text": "There's the tangent line, well, not quite straight.", "label": []}
{"id": 8913, "text": "Close enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 8914, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8915, "text": "I did it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8916, "text": "That's the geometric problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 8917, "text": "I achieved what I wanted to do, and it's kind of an interesting question, which unfortunately I can't solve for you in this class, which is, how did I do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8918, "text": "That is, how physically did I manage to know what to do to draw this tangent line?", "label": []}
{"id": 8919, "text": "But that's what geometric problems are like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8920, "text": "We visualize it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8921, "text": "We can figure it out somewhere in our brains.", "label": []}
{"id": 8922, "text": "It happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 8923, "text": "And the task that we have now is to figure out how to do it analytically, to do it in a way that a machine could just as well as I did in drawing this tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8924, "text": "So, what did we learn in high school about what a tangent line is?", "label": []}
{"id": 8925, "text": "Well, a tangent line has an equation, and any line through a point has the equation <EQUATION>, the slope, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8926, "text": "So here's the equation for that line, and now there are two pieces of information that we're going to need to work out what the line is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8927, "text": "The first one is the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8928, "text": "That's that point <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8929, "text": "And to specify <EXPRESSION>, given <EXPRESSION>, we need to know the level of <EXPRESSION>, which is of course just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8930, "text": "That's not a calculus problem, but anyway that's a very important part of the process.", "label": []}
{"id": 8931, "text": "So that's the first thing we need to know.", "label": []}
{"id": 8932, "text": "And the second thing we need to know is the slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8933, "text": "And that's this number <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8934, "text": "And in calculus we have another name for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8935, "text": "We call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8936, "text": "Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8937, "text": "So that's the calculus part.", "label": []}
{"id": 8938, "text": "That's the tricky part, and that's the part that we have to discuss now.", "label": []}
{"id": 8939, "text": "So just to make that explicit here, I'm going to make a definition, which is that <EXPRESSION> , which is known as the derivative, of <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>, is the slope of the tangent line to <EQUATION> at the point, let's just call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8940, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8941, "text": "So, that's what it is, but still I haven't made any progress in figuring out any better how I drew that line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8942, "text": "So I have to say something that's more concrete, because I want to be able to cook up what these numbers are.", "label": []}
{"id": 8943, "text": "I have to figure out what this number <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8944, "text": "And one way of thinking about that, let me just try this, so I certainly am taking for granted that in sort of non-calculus part that I know what a line through a point is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8945, "text": "So I know this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8946, "text": "But another possibility might be, this line here, how do I know - well, unfortunately, I didn't draw it quite straight, but there it is - how do I know that this orange line is not a tangent line, but this other line is a tangent line?", "label": []}
{"id": 8947, "text": "Well, it's actually not so obvious, but I'm gonna describe it a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8948, "text": "It's not really the fact-- this thing crosses at some other place, which is this point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8949, "text": "But it's not really the fact that the thing crosses at two place, because the line could be wiggly, the curve could be wiggly, and it could cross back and forth a number of times.", "label": []}
{"id": 8950, "text": "That's not what distinguishes the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8951, "text": "So I'm gonna have to somehow grasp this, and I'll first do it in language.", "label": []}
{"id": 8952, "text": "And it's the following idea: it's that if you take this orange line, which is called a secant line, and you think of the point <EXPRESSION> as getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8953, "text": "And if we draw it close enough, then that's gonna be the correct line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8954, "text": "So that's really what I did, sort of in my brain when I drew that first line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8955, "text": "And so that's the way I'm going to articulate it first.", "label": []}
{"id": 8956, "text": "Now, so the tangent line is = the limit of so called secant lines <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8957, "text": "And here we're thinking of P as being fixed and <EXPRESSION> as variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8958, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8959, "text": "Again, this is still the geometric discussion, but now we're gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8960, "text": "And we'll be able to work out formulas in any example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8961, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8962, "text": "So first of all, I'm gonna write out these points <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8963, "text": "So maybe we'll put <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8964, "text": "And I'm thinking of this line through them.", "label": []}
{"id": 8965, "text": "I guess it was orange, so we'll leave it as orange.", "label": []}
{"id": 8966, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8967, "text": "And now I want to compute its slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8968, "text": "So this, gradually, we'll do this in two steps.", "label": []}
{"id": 8969, "text": "And these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus, including multi-variable calculus, across the board.", "label": []}
{"id": 8970, "text": "So the first notation that's used is you imagine here's the x-axis underneath, and here's the <EXPRESSION>, the location directly below the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8971, "text": "And we're traveling here a horizontal distance which is denoted by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8972, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>, so called.", "label": []}
{"id": 8973, "text": "And we could also call it the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8974, "text": "So that's one thing we want to measure in order to get the slope of this line <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8975, "text": "And the other thing is this height.", "label": []}
{"id": 8976, "text": "So that's this distance here, which we denote <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8977, "text": "And then, the slope is just the ratio, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8978, "text": "So this is the slope of the secant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8979, "text": "And the process I just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself, but also in particular to its slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8980, "text": "And the way we write that is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8981, "text": "And that's going to be our slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 8982, "text": "So this is the slope of the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 8983, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 8984, "text": "Now, This is still a little general, and I want to work out a more usable form here, a better formula for this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8985, "text": "And in order to do that, I'm gonna write <EXPRESSION>, the numerator more explicitly here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8986, "text": "The change in f, so remember that the point <EXPRESSION> is the point (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "label": []}
{"id": 8987, "text": "All right, that's what we got for the formula for the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8988, "text": "And in order to compute these distances and in particular the vertical distance here, I'm gonna have to get a formula for <EXPRESSION> as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 8989, "text": "So if this horizontal distance is <EXPRESSION>, then this location is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8990, "text": "And so the point above that point has a formula, which is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> of - and this is a mouthful - <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8991, "text": "All right, so there's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8992, "text": "Here's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8993, "text": "And now I can write a different formula for the derivative, which is the following: so this <EXPRESSION> , which is the same as <EXPRESSION>, is going to be the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of the change in <EXPRESSION>, well the change in <EXPRESSION> is the value of <EXPRESSION> at the upper point here, which is <EXPRESSION>, and minus its value at the lower point <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8994, "text": "All right, so this is the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 8995, "text": "I'm going to put this in a little box, because this is by far the most important formula today, which we use to derive pretty much everything else.", "label": []}
{"id": 8996, "text": "And this is the way that we're going to be able to compute these numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8997, "text": "So let's do an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8998, "text": "This example, we'll call this example one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8999, "text": "We'll take the function <EXPRESSION> , which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9000, "text": "That's sufficiently complicated to have an interesting answer, and sufficiently straightforward that we can compute the derivative fairly quickly.", "label": []}
{"id": 9001, "text": "So what is it that we're gonna do here?", "label": []}
{"id": 9002, "text": "All we're going to do is we're going to plug in this formula here for that function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9003, "text": "That's all we're going to do, and visually what we're accomplishing is somehow to take the hyperbola, and take a point on the hyperbola, and figure out some tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 9004, "text": "That's what we're accomplishing when we do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9005, "text": "So we're accomplishing this geometrically but we'll be doing it algebraically.", "label": []}
{"id": 9006, "text": "So first, we consider this difference <EXPRESSION> and write out its formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 9007, "text": "So I have to have a place.", "label": []}
{"id": 9008, "text": "So I'm gonna make it again above this point <EXPRESSION>, which is the general point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9009, "text": "We'll make the general calculation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9010, "text": "So the value of <EXPRESSION> at the top, when we move to the right by <EXPRESSION>, so I just read off from this, read off from here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9011, "text": "The formula, the first thing I get here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9012, "text": "That's the left hand term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9013, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, that's the right hand term.", "label": []}
{"id": 9014, "text": "And then I have to divide that by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9015, "text": "OK, so here's our expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 9016, "text": "And by the way this has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 9017, "text": "This thing is called a difference quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 9018, "text": "It's pretty complicated, because there's always a difference in the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9019, "text": "And in disguise, the denominator is a difference, because it's the difference between the value on the right side and the value on the left side here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9020, "text": "OK, so now we're going to simplify it by some algebra.", "label": []}
{"id": 9021, "text": "So let's just take a look.", "label": []}
{"id": 9022, "text": "So this =, let's continue on the next level here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9023, "text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9024, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9025, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9026, "text": "All I'm going to do is put it over a common denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9027, "text": "So the common denominator is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9028, "text": "And so in the numerator for the first expressions I have <EXPRESSION>, and for the second expression I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9029, "text": "So this is the same thing as I had in the numerator before, factoring out this denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9030, "text": "And here I put that numerator into this more amenable form.", "label": []}
{"id": 9031, "text": "And now there are two basic cancellations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9032, "text": "The first one is that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel, so we have this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9033, "text": "And then the second step is that these two expressions cancel, the numerator and the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9034, "text": "Now we have a cancellation that we can make use of.", "label": []}
{"id": 9035, "text": "So we'll write that under here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9036, "text": "And this is = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9037, "text": "And then the very last step is to take the limit as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, and now we can do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9038, "text": "Before we couldn't do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9039, "text": "Why?", "label": []}
{"id": 9040, "text": "Because the numerator and the denominator gave us <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9041, "text": "But now that I've made this cancellation, I can pass to the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9042, "text": "And all that happens is I set this <EXPRESSION>, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9043, "text": "So that's the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 9044, "text": "All right, so in other words what I've shown - let me put it up here - is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9045, "text": "Now, let's look at the graph just a little bit to check this for plausibility, all right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9046, "text": "What's happening here is, first of all it's negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9047, "text": "It's less than <EXPRESSION>, which is a good thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9048, "text": "You see that slope there is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9049, "text": "That's the simplest check that you could make.", "label": []}
{"id": 9050, "text": "And the second thing that I would just like to point out is that as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, that as we go farther to the right, it gets less and less steep.", "label": []}
{"id": 9051, "text": "So as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, less and less steep.", "label": []}
{"id": 9052, "text": "So that's also consistent here, when <EXPRESSION> is very large, this is a smaller and smaller number in magnitude, although it's always negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9053, "text": "It's always sloping down.", "label": []}
{"id": 9054, "text": "All right, so I've managed to fill the boards.", "label": []}
{"id": 9055, "text": "So maybe I should stop for a question or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9056, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 9057, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is to explain again this limiting process.", "label": []}
{"id": 9058, "text": "So the formula here is we have basically <EXPRESSION> numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 9059, "text": "So in other words, why is it that this expression, when <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> ?", "label": []}
{"id": 9060, "text": "Let me illustrate it by sticking in a number for <EXPRESSION> to make it more explicit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9061, "text": "All right, so for instance, let me stick in here for <EXPRESSION> the number <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9062, "text": "Then it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9063, "text": "That's the situation that we've got.", "label": []}
{"id": 9064, "text": "And now the question is what happens as this number gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and gets to be practically <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9065, "text": "Well, literally what we can do is just plug in <EXPRESSION> there, and you get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9066, "text": "<EXPRESSION> in the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9067, "text": "So this tends to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9068, "text": "And that's what I'm saying in general with this extra number here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9069, "text": "Other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 9070, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 9071, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: So the question is what happened between this step and this step, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 9072, "text": "Explain this step here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9073, "text": "Alright, so there were two parts to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9074, "text": "The first is this <EXPRESSION> which is sitting in the denominator, I factored all the way out front.", "label": []}
{"id": 9075, "text": "And so what's in the parentheses is supposed to be the same as what's in the numerator of this other expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 9076, "text": "And then, at the same time as doing that, I put that expression, which is the difference of two fractions, I expressed it with a common denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 9077, "text": "So in the denominator here, you see the product of the denominators of the two fractions.", "label": []}
{"id": 9078, "text": "And then I just figured out what the numerator had to be without really.", "label": []}
{"id": 9079, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9080, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9081, "text": "Other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 9082, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 9083, "text": "So I claim that on the whole, calculus gets a bad rap, that it's actually easier than most things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9084, "text": "But there's a perception that it's harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 9085, "text": "And so I really have a duty to give you the calculus made harder story here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9086, "text": "So we have to make things harder, because that's our job.", "label": []}
{"id": 9087, "text": "And this is actually what most people do in calculus, and it's the reason why calculus has a bad reputation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9088, "text": "So the secret is that when people ask problems in calculus, they generally ask them in context.", "label": []}
{"id": 9089, "text": "And there are many, many other things going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9090, "text": "And so the little piece of the problem which is calculus is actually fairly routine and has to be isolated and gotten through.", "label": []}
{"id": 9091, "text": "But all the rest of it, relies on everything else you learned in mathematics up to this stage, from grade school through high school.", "label": []}
{"id": 9092, "text": "So that's the complication.", "label": []}
{"id": 9093, "text": "So now we're going to do a little bit of calculus made hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 9094, "text": "By talking about a word problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9095, "text": "We only have one sort of word problem that we can pose, because all we've talked about is this geometry point of view.", "label": []}
{"id": 9096, "text": "So far those are the only kinds of word problems we can pose.", "label": []}
{"id": 9097, "text": "So what we're gonna do is just pose such a problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9098, "text": "So find the areas of triangles, enclosed by the axes and the tangent to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9099, "text": "OK, so that's a geometry problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9100, "text": "And let me draw a picture of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9101, "text": "It's practically the same as the picture for example one.", "label": []}
{"id": 9102, "text": "We only consider the first quadrant.", "label": []}
{"id": 9103, "text": "Here's our shape.", "label": []}
{"id": 9104, "text": "All right, it's the hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 9105, "text": "And here's maybe one of our tangent lines, which is coming in like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 9106, "text": "And then we're trying to find this area here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9107, "text": "Right, so there's our problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9108, "text": "So why does it have to do with calculus?", "label": []}
{"id": 9109, "text": "It has to do with calculus because there's a tangent line in it, so we're gonna need to do some calculus to answer this question.", "label": []}
{"id": 9110, "text": "But as you'll see, the calculus is the easy part.", "label": []}
{"id": 9111, "text": "So let's get started with this problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9112, "text": "First of all, I'm gonna label a few things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9113, "text": "And one important thing to remember of course, is that the curve is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9114, "text": "That's perfectly reasonable to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9115, "text": "And also, we're gonna calculate the areas of the triangles, and you could ask yourself, in terms of what?", "label": []}
{"id": 9116, "text": "Well, we're gonna have to pick a point and give it a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 9117, "text": "And since we need a number, we're gonna have to do more than geometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 9118, "text": "We're gonna have to do some of this analysis just as we've done before.", "label": []}
{"id": 9119, "text": "So I'm gonna pick a point and, consistent with the labeling we've done before, I'm gonna to call it (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "label": []}
{"id": 9120, "text": "So that's almost half the battle, having notations, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> for the variables, and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, for the specific point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9121, "text": "Now, once you see that you have these labelings, I hope it's reasonable to do the following.", "label": []}
{"id": 9122, "text": "So first of all, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, and over here is the point <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9123, "text": "That's something that we're used to in graphs.", "label": []}
{"id": 9124, "text": "And in order to figure out the area of this triangle, it's pretty clear that we should find the base, which is that we should find this location here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9125, "text": "And we should find the height, so we need to find that value there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9126, "text": "Let's go ahead and do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9127, "text": "So how are we going to do this?", "label": []}
{"id": 9128, "text": "Well, so let's just take a look.", "label": []}
{"id": 9129, "text": "So what is it that we need to do?", "label": []}
{"id": 9130, "text": "I claim that there's only one calculus step, and I'm gonna put a star here for this tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 9131, "text": "I have to understand what the tangent line is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9132, "text": "Once I've figured out what the tangent line is, the rest of the problem is no longer calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9133, "text": "It's just that slope that we need.", "label": []}
{"id": 9134, "text": "So what's the formula for the tangent line?", "label": []}
{"id": 9135, "text": "Put that over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9136, "text": "it's going to be <EXPRESSION> =, and here's the magic number, we already calculated it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9137, "text": "It's in the box over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9138, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9139, "text": "So this is the only bit of calculus in this problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9140, "text": "But now we're not done.", "label": []}
{"id": 9141, "text": "We have to finish it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9142, "text": "We have to figure out all the rest of these quantities so we can figure out the area.", "label": []}
{"id": 9143, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 9144, "text": "So how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9145, "text": "Well, to find this point, this has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 9146, "text": "We're gonna find the so called <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9147, "text": "That's the first thing we're going to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9148, "text": "So to do that, what we need to do is to find where this horizontal line meets that diagonal line.", "label": []}
{"id": 9149, "text": "And the equation for the <EXPRESSION> is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9150, "text": "So we plug in <EQUATION>, that's this horizontal line, and we find this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9151, "text": "So let's do that into star.", "label": []}
{"id": 9152, "text": "We get <EXPRESSION> minus, oh one other thing we need to know.", "label": []}
{"id": 9153, "text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , so this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9154, "text": "And that's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9155, "text": "And here's <EXPRESSION>, and here's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9156, "text": "All right, so in order to find this x value, I have to plug in one equation into the other.", "label": []}
{"id": 9157, "text": "So this simplifies a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 9158, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9159, "text": "And this is plus <EXPRESSION> because the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel somewhat.", "label": []}
{"id": 9160, "text": "And so if I put this on the other side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9161, "text": "And if I then multiply through - so that's what this implies - and if I multiply through by <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9162, "text": "OK, so I claim that this point we've just calculated, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9163, "text": "Now, I'm almost done.", "label": []}
{"id": 9164, "text": "I need to get the other one.", "label": []}
{"id": 9165, "text": "I need to get this one up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9166, "text": "Now I'm gonna use a very big shortcut to do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9167, "text": "So the shortcut to the y-intercept is to use symmetry.", "label": []}
{"id": 9168, "text": "All right, I claim I can stare at this and I can look at that, and I know the formula for the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9169, "text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9170, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 9171, "text": "That's what that one is.", "label": []}
{"id": 9172, "text": "So this one is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9173, "text": "And the reason I know this is the following: so here's the symmetry of the situation, which is not completely direct.", "label": []}
{"id": 9174, "text": "It's a kind of mirror symmetry around the diagonal.", "label": []}
{"id": 9175, "text": "It involves the exchange of (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>) with (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>); so trading the roles of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9176, "text": "So the symmetry that I'm using is that any formula I get that involves <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, if I trade all the <EXPRESSION> and replace them by <EXPRESSION> and trade all the <EXPRESSION> and replace them by <EXPRESSION>, then I'll have a correct formula on the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9177, "text": "So if everywhere I see a <EXPRESSION> I make it an <EXPRESSION>, and everywhere I see an <EXPRESSION> I make it a <EXPRESSION>, the switch will take place.", "label": []}
{"id": 9178, "text": "So why is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9179, "text": "That's just an accident of this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9180, "text": "That's because, so the symmetry explained.", "label": []}
{"id": 9181, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9182, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 9183, "text": "is that the equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9184, "text": "But that's the same thing as <EQUATION>, if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9185, "text": "So here's where the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> get reversed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9186, "text": "OK now if you don't trust this explanation, you can also get the y-intercept by plugging <EQUATION> into the equation star.", "label": []}
{"id": 9187, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 9188, "text": "We plugged <EQUATION> in and we got the <EXPRESSION>-value.", "label": []}
{"id": 9189, "text": "And you can do the same thing analogously the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9190, "text": "All right so I'm almost done with the geometry problem, and let's finish it off now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9191, "text": "Well, let me hold off for one second before I finish it off.", "label": []}
{"id": 9192, "text": "What I'd like to say is just make one more tiny remark.", "label": []}
{"id": 9193, "text": "And this is the hardest part of calculus in my opinion.", "label": []}
{"id": 9194, "text": "So the hardest part of calculus is that we call it one variable calculus, but we're perfectly happy to deal with <EXPRESSION> variables at a time or <EXPRESSION>, or any number.", "label": []}
{"id": 9195, "text": "In this problem, I had an <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>, an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9196, "text": "That's already <EXPRESSION> different things that have various relationships between them.", "label": []}
{"id": 9197, "text": "Of course the manipulations we do with them are algebraic, and when we're doing the derivatives we just consider what's known as one variable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9198, "text": "But really there are millions of variable floating around potentially.", "label": []}
{"id": 9199, "text": "So that's what makes things complicated, and that's something that you have to get used to.", "label": []}
{"id": 9200, "text": "Now there's something else which is more subtle, and that I think many people who teach the subject or use the subject aren't aware, because they've already entered into the language and they're so comfortable with it that they don't even notice this confusion.", "label": []}
{"id": 9201, "text": "There's something deliberately sloppy about the way we deal with these variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9202, "text": "The reason is very simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 9203, "text": "There are already <EXPRESSION> variables here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9204, "text": "I don't wanna create six names for variables or eight names for variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9205, "text": "But really in this problem there were about eight.", "label": []}
{"id": 9206, "text": "I just slipped them by you.", "label": []}
{"id": 9207, "text": "So why is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9208, "text": "Well notice that the first time that I got a formula for <EXPRESSION> here, it was this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 9209, "text": "And so the formula for <EXPRESSION>, which I plugged in right here, was from the equation of the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 9210, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9211, "text": "The second time I did it, I did not use <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9212, "text": "I used this equation here, so this is not <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9213, "text": "That's the wrong thing to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 9214, "text": "It's an easy mistake to make if the formulas are all a blur to you and you're not paying attention to where they are on the diagram.", "label": []}
{"id": 9215, "text": "You see that x-intercept calculation there involved where this horizontal line met this diagonal line, and <EQUATION> represented this line here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9216, "text": "So the sloppiness is that <EXPRESSION> means two different things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9217, "text": "And we do this constantly because it's way, way more complicated not to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9218, "text": "It's much more convenient for us to allow ourselves the flexibility to change the role that this letter plays in the middle of a computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9219, "text": "And similarly, later on, if I had done this by this more straightforward method, for the y-intercept, I would have set <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9220, "text": "That would have been this vertical line, which is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9221, "text": "But I didn't change the letter <EXPRESSION> when I did that, because that would be a waste for us.", "label": []}
{"id": 9222, "text": "So this is one of the main confusions that happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 9223, "text": "If you can keep yourself straight, you're a lot better off, and as I say this is one of the complexities.", "label": []}
{"id": 9224, "text": "All right, so now let's finish off the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 9225, "text": "Let me finally get this area here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9226, "text": "So, actually I'll just finish it off right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9227, "text": "So the area of the triangle is, well it's the base times the height.", "label": []}
{"id": 9228, "text": "The base is <EXPRESSION>, the height is <EXPRESSION>, and a half of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9229, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION> , which is <EXPRESSION>, which is, lo and behold, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9230, "text": "So the amusing thing in this case is that it actually didn't matter what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.", "label": []}
{"id": 9231, "text": "We get the same answer every time.", "label": []}
{"id": 9232, "text": "That's just an accident of the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9233, "text": "It happens to be the function with that property.", "label": []}
{"id": 9234, "text": "All right, so we have some more business today, some serious business.", "label": []}
{"id": 9235, "text": "So let me continue.", "label": []}
{"id": 9236, "text": "So, first of all, I want to give you a few more notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9237, "text": "And these are just other notations that people use to refer to derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 9238, "text": "And the first one is the following: we already wrote <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9239, "text": "And so when we write <EXPRESSION>, that means the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9240, "text": "That's a typical notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9241, "text": "And previously we wrote <EXPRESSION> for the derivative, so this is Newton's notation for the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9242, "text": "But there are other notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9243, "text": "And one of them is <EXPRESSION>, and another one is <EXPRESSION>, meaning exactly the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 9244, "text": "And sometimes we let the function slip down below so that becomes <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9245, "text": "So these are all notations that are used for the derivative, and these were initiated by Leibniz.", "label": []}
{"id": 9246, "text": "And these notations are used interchangeably, sometimes practically together.", "label": []}
{"id": 9247, "text": "They both turn out to be extremely useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 9248, "text": "This one omits - notice that this thing omits - the underlying base point, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9249, "text": "That's one of the nuisances.", "label": []}
{"id": 9250, "text": "It doesn't give you all the information.", "label": []}
{"id": 9251, "text": "But there are lots of situations like that where people leave out some of the important information, and you have to fill it in from context.", "label": []}
{"id": 9252, "text": "So that's another couple of notations.", "label": []}
{"id": 9253, "text": "So now I have one more calculation for you today.", "label": []}
{"id": 9254, "text": "I carried out this calculation of the derivative of the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9255, "text": "I wanna take care of some other powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 9256, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}

{"id": 9271, "text": "Anyway, no <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9272, "text": "So think of <EXPRESSION> as fixed.", "label": []}
{"id": 9273, "text": "In this case, <EXPRESSION> moves and <EXPRESSION> is fixed in this calculation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9274, "text": "All right now, in order to simplify this, in order to understand algebraically what's going on, I need to understand what the nth power of a sum is.", "label": []}

{"id": 9276, "text": "We only need a little tiny bit of it, called the binomial theorem.", "label": []}

{"id": 9292, "text": "So here we go.", "label": []}

{"id": 9739, "text": "That tells us that <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9740, "text": "And now <EXPRESSION> for relation to <EXPRESSION> is basically <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 9765, "text": "You cannot give it a particular value.", "label": []}
{"id": 9766, "text": "All you can do with a differential is express it in terms of other differentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 9767, "text": "In fact, this <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, well, they are mostly symbols out there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9768, "text": "But if you want to think about them, they are the differentials of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9769, "text": "In fact, you can think of these differentials as placeholders where you will put other things.", "label": []}
{"id": 9770, "text": "Of course, they represent, you know, there is this idea of changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9771, "text": "One way that one could explain it, and I don't really like it, is to say they represent infinitesimal changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 9772, "text": "Another way to say it, and I think that is probably closer to the truth, is that these things are somehow placeholders to put values and get a tangent approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9773, "text": "For example, if I do replace these symbols by <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> numbers then I will actually get a numerical quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9774, "text": "And that will be an approximation formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9775, "text": "It will be the linear approximation, a tangent plane approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 9776, "text": "What we can do -- Well, let me start first with maybe something even before that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9777, "text": "The first thing that it does is it can encode how changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> affect the value of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9778, "text": "I would say that is the most general answer to what is this formula, what are these differentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 9779, "text": "It is a relation between <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9780, "text": "And this is a placeholder for small variations, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to get an approximation formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 9781, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION> is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9782, "text": "It is getting cramped, but I am sure you know what is going on here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9783, "text": "And observe how this one is actually = while that one is approximately =.", "label": []}
{"id": 9784, "text": "So they are really not the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 9785, "text": "Another thing that the notation suggests we can do, and they claim we can do, is divide everything by some variable that everybody depends on.", "label": []}
{"id": 9786, "text": "Say, for example, that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> actually depend on some parameter <EXPRESSION> then they will vary, at a certain rate, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9787, "text": "And what the differential will tell us then is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>, when you plug in these values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, you will get <EXPRESSION> by dividing everything by <EXPRESSION> in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 9788, "text": "The first thing we can do is divide by something like dt to get infinitesimal rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 9789, "text": "Well, let me just say rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 9790, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9791, "text": "And that corresponds to the situation where <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9792, "text": "That means you can plug in these values into <EXPRESSION> to get, well, the value of <EXPRESSION> will depend on <EXPRESSION>, and then you can find the rate of change with <EXPRESSION> of a value of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9793, "text": "These are the basic rules.", "label": []}
{"id": 9794, "text": "And this is known as the chain rule.", "label": []}

{"id": 9866, "text": "It should be exactly the same answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 9867, "text": "And, in fact, in this case, the two calculations are roughly = in complication.", "label": []}
{"id": 9868, "text": "But say that your function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> was much more complicated than that, or maybe you actually didn't know a formula for it, you only knew its partial derivatives, then you would need to use the chain rule.", "label": []}

{"id": 9874, "text": "<EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, so you get <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9875, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, we know how to take the derivative using single variable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9876, "text": "Well, we should know.", "label": []}

{"id": 9882, "text": "Any questions about that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9883, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 9884, "text": "What kind of object is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9885, "text": "Well, you can think of <EXPRESSION> as just another variable that is given as a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, for example.", "label": []}
{"id": 9886, "text": "You would have a function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> defined by this formula, and I call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9887, "text": "I call its value <EXPRESSION> so that I can substitute <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9888, "text": "Well, let's think of <EXPRESSION> as a function of three variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9889, "text": "And then, when I plug in the dependents of these three variables on <EXPRESSION>, then it becomes just a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 9894, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 9895, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 9896, "text": "Here is an application of what we have seen.", "label": []}
{"id": 9897, "text": "Let's say that you want to understand actually all these rules about taking derivatives in single variable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9898, "text": "What I showed you at the beginning, and then erased, basically justifies how to take the derivative of a reciprocal function.", "label": []}
{"id": 9899, "text": "And for that you didn't need multivariable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 9900, "text": "But let's try to justify the product rule, for example, for the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 9901, "text": "An application of this actually is to justify the product and quotient rules.", "label": []}
{"id": 9902, "text": "Let's think, for example, of a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, that is just the product <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9903, "text": "And let's say that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are actually functions of one variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9904, "text": "Then, well, <EXPRESSION> is given by the chain rule applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9905, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9906, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9907, "text": "But now what is the partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9908, "text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9909, "text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9910, "text": "And partial of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is going to be just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9911, "text": "So you get back the usual product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 9912, "text": "That is a slightly complicated way of deriving it, but that is a valid way of understanding how to take the derivative of a product by thinking of the product first as a function of variables, which are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9913, "text": "And then say, oh, but <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were actually functions of a variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9914, "text": "And then you do the differentiation in two stages using the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 9915, "text": "Similarly, you can do the quotient rule just for practice.", "label": []}
{"id": 9916, "text": "If I give you the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9917, "text": "Right now I am thinking of it as a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9918, "text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> themselves are actually going to be functions of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9919, "text": "Then, well, <EXPRESSION> is going to be partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9920, "text": "How much is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9921, "text": "How much is partial <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9922, "text": "<EXPRESSION> -- Well, next we need to have partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9923, "text": "Well, what is the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9924, "text": "Here we need to know how to differentiate the inverse.", "label": []}
{"id": 9925, "text": "It is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9926, "text": "And that is actually the usual quotient rule just written in a slightly different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 9927, "text": "I mean, just in case you really want to see it, if you clear denominators for <EXPRESSION> then you will see basically <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9928, "text": "Now let's go to something even more crazy.", "label": []}
{"id": 9929, "text": "I claim we can do chain rules with more variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9930, "text": "Let's say that I have a quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 9931, "text": "Let's call it <EXPRESSION> for now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9932, "text": "Let's say I have quantity <EXPRESSION> as a function of say variables <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9933, "text": "And so in the previous setup <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depended on some parameters <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9934, "text": "But, actually, let's now look at the case where <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> themselves are functions of several variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9935, "text": "Let's say of two more variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9936, "text": "Let's call them <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9937, "text": "I am going to stay with these abstract letters, but if it bothers you, if it sounds completely unmotivated think about it maybe in terms of something you might now.", "label": []}
{"id": 9938, "text": "Say, polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 9939, "text": "Let's say that I have a function but is defined in terms of the polar coordinate variables on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9940, "text": "And then I know I want to switch to usual coordinates <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9941, "text": "Or, the other way around, I have a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and I want to express it in terms of the polar coordinates <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9942, "text": "Then I would want to know maybe how the derivatives, with respect to the various sets of variables, related to each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 9943, "text": "One way I could do it is, of course, to say now if I plug the formula for <EXPRESSION> and the formula for <EXPRESSION> into the formula for <EXPRESSION> then <EXPRESSION> becomes a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and it can try to take partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 9944, "text": "If I have explicit formulas, well, that could work.", "label": []}
{"id": 9945, "text": "But maybe the formulas are complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9946, "text": "Typically, if I switch between rectangular and polar coordinates, there might be inverse trig, there might be maybe arctangent to express the polar angle in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9947, "text": "And when I don't really want to actually substitute arctangents everywhere, maybe I would rather deal with the derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 9948, "text": "How do I do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9949, "text": "The question is what are partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> and partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> in terms of, let's see, what do we need to know to understand that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9950, "text": "Well, probably we should know how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9951, "text": "If we don't know that then we are probably toast.", "label": []}
{"id": 9952, "text": "Partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>, partial  over partial <EXPRESSION> should be required.", "label": []}
{"id": 9953, "text": "What else should we know?", "label": []}
{"id": 9954, "text": "Well, it would probably help to know how <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9955, "text": "If we don't know that then we don't really know how to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 9956, "text": "We need also <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9957, "text": "We have a lot of partials in there.", "label": []}
{"id": 9958, "text": "Well, let's see how we can do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 9959, "text": "Let's start by writing <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9960, "text": "We know that <EXPRESSION> is partial <EXPRESSION>, well, I don't know why I have two names, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9961, "text": "I mean <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are really the same thing here, but let's say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9962, "text": "So far that is our new friend, the differential.", "label": []}
{"id": 9963, "text": "Now what do we want to do with it?", "label": []}
{"id": 9964, "text": "Well, we would like to get rid of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> because we like to express things in terms of, you know, the question we are asking ourselves is let's say that I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit, how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "label": []}
{"id": 9965, "text": "Of course, what happens, if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit, is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> will change.", "label": []}
{"id": 9966, "text": "How do they change?", "label": []}
{"id": 9967, "text": "Well, that is given to me by the differential.", "label": []}
{"id": 9968, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is going to be, well, I can use the differential again.", "label": []}
{"id": 9969, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9970, "text": "That will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9971, "text": "That is, again, taking the differential of a function of two variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 9972, "text": "Does that make sense?", "label": []}
{"id": 9973, "text": "And then we have the other guy, <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 9974, "text": "Well, similarly <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9975, "text": "And now we have a relation between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9976, "text": "We are expressing how <EXPRESSION> reacts to changes in <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which was our goal.", "label": []}
{"id": 9977, "text": "Now, let's actually collect terms so that we see it a bit better.", "label": []}
{"id": 9978, "text": "It is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9979, "text": "Now we have <EXPRESSION> = something <EXPRESSION> plus something <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9980, "text": "Well, the coefficient here has to be partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9981, "text": "What else could it be?", "label": []}
{"id": 9982, "text": "That's the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> if I forget what happens when I change <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9983, "text": "That is the definition of a partial.", "label": []}
{"id": 9984, "text": "Similarly, this one has to be partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9985, "text": "That is because it is the rate of change with respect to , if I keep <EXPRESSION> constant, so that these guys are completely ignored.", "label": []}
{"id": 9986, "text": "Now you see how the total differential accounts for, somehow, all the partial derivatives that come as coefficients of the individual variables in these expressions.", "label": []}
{"id": 9987, "text": "Let me maybe rewrite these formulas in a more visible way and then re-explain them to you.", "label": []}
{"id": 9988, "text": "Here is the chain rule for this situation, with two intermediate variables and two variables that you express these in terms of.", "label": []}
{"id": 9989, "text": "In our setting, we get partial <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9990, "text": "And the other one, the same thing with <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9991, "text": "I have to explain various things about these formulas because they look complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9992, "text": "And, actually, they are not that complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 9993, "text": "A couple of things to know.", "label": []}
{"id": 9994, "text": "The first thing, how do we remember a formula like that?", "label": []}
{"id": 9995, "text": "Well, that is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 9996, "text": "We want to know how <EXPRESSION> depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9997, "text": "Well, what does <EXPRESSION> depend on?", "label": []}
{"id": 9998, "text": "It depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 9999, "text": "So we will put partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION> and partial <EXPRESSION> over partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10000, "text": "Now, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, why are they here?", "label": []}
{"id": 10001, "text": "Well, they are here because they actually depend on <EXPRESSION> as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 10002, "text": "How does <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 10003, "text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10004, "text": "How does <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 10005, "text": "The answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10006, "text": "See, the structure of this formula is simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 10007, "text": "To find the partial of f with respect to some new variable you use the partials with respect to the variables that <EXPRESSION> was initially defined in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10008, "text": "And you multiply them by the partials of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in terms of the new variable that you want to look at, <EXPRESSION> here, and you sum these things together.", "label": []}
{"id": 10009, "text": "That is the structure of the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 10010, "text": "Why does it work?", "label": []}
{"id": 10011, "text": "Well, let me explain it to you in a slightly different language.", "label": []}
{"id": 10012, "text": "This asks us how does <EXPRESSION> change if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit?", "label": []}
{"id": 10013, "text": "Well, why would <EXPRESSION> change if <EXPRESSION> changes a little bit?", "label": []}
{"id": 10014, "text": "Well, it would change because <EXPRESSION> actually depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10015, "text": "If I change <EXPRESSION>, how quickly does <EXPRESSION> change?", "label": []}
{"id": 10016, "text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10017, "text": "And now, if I change <EXPRESSION> at this rate, how does that have to change?", "label": []}
{"id": 10018, "text": "Well, the answer is <EXPRESSION> times this guy.", "label": []}
{"id": 10019, "text": "Well, at the same time, <EXPRESSION> is also changing.", "label": []}
{"id": 10020, "text": "How fast is <EXPRESSION> changing if I change <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 10021, "text": "Well, at the rate of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10022, "text": "But now if I change this how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "label": []}
{"id": 10023, "text": "Well, the rate of change is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10024, "text": "The product is the effect of how you change it, changing <EXPRESSION>, and therefore changing <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10025, "text": "Now, what happens in real life, if I change <EXPRESSION> a little bit?", "label": []}
{"id": 10026, "text": "Well, both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> change at the same time.", "label": []}
{"id": 10027, "text": "So how does <EXPRESSION> change?", "label": []}
{"id": 10028, "text": "Well, it is the sum of the two effects.", "label": []}
{"id": 10029, "text": "Does that make sense?", "label": []}
{"id": 10030, "text": "Good.", "label": []}
{"id": 10031, "text": "Of course, if <EXPRESSION> depends on more variables then you just have more terms in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 10032, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 10033, "text": "Here is another thing that may be a little bit confusing.", "label": []}
{"id": 10034, "text": "What is tempting?", "label": []}
{"id": 10035, "text": "Well, what is tempting here would be to simplify these formulas by removing these partial x's.", "label": []}
{"id": 10036, "text": "Let's simplify by partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10037, "text": "Let's simplify by partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10038, "text": "We get partial <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10039, "text": "Something is not working properly.", "label": []}
{"id": 10040, "text": "Why doesn't it work?", "label": []}
{"id": 10041, "text": "The answer is precisely because these are partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 10042, "text": "These are not total derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 10043, "text": "And so you cannot simplify them in that way.", "label": []}
{"id": 10044, "text": "And that is actually the reason why we use this <EXPRESSION> rather than a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10045, "text": "It is to remind us, beware, there are these simplifications that we can do with straight d's that are not legal here.", "label": []}
{"id": 10046, "text": "Somehow, when you have a partial derivative, you must resist the urge of simplifying things.", "label": []}
{"id": 10047, "text": "No simplifications in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 10048, "text": "That is the simplest formula you can get.", "label": []}
{"id": 10049, "text": "Any questions at this point?", "label": []}
{"id": 10050, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 10051, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 10052, "text": "When would you use this and what does it describe?", "label": []}
{"id": 10053, "text": "Well, it is basically when you have a function given in terms of a certain set of variables because maybe there is a simply expression in terms of those variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 10054, "text": "But ultimately what you care about is not those variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but another set of variables, here <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10055, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are giving you a nice formula for <EXPRESSION>, but actually the relevant variables for your problem are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10056, "text": "And you know <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are related to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10057, "text": "So, of course, what you could do is plug the formulas the way that we did substituting.", "label": []}
{"id": 10058, "text": "But maybe that will give you very complicated expressions.", "label": []}
{"id": 10059, "text": "And maybe it is actually easier to just work with the derivates.", "label": []}
{"id": 10060, "text": "The important claim here is basically we don't need to know the actual formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 10061, "text": "All we need to know are the rate of changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 10062, "text": "If we know all these rates of change then we know how to take these derivatives without actually having to plug in values.", "label": []}
{"id": 10063, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 10064, "text": "Yes, you could certain do the same things in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10065, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were functions of <EXPRESSION> instead of being functions of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> then it would be the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 10066, "text": "And you would have the same formulas that I had, well, over there I still have it.", "label": []}
{"id": 10067, "text": "Why does that one have straight d's?", "label": []}
{"id": 10068, "text": "Well, the answer is I could put <EXPRESSION> if I wanted, but I end up with a function of a single variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 10069, "text": "If you have a single variable then the partial, with respect to that variable, is the same thing as the usual derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 10070, "text": "We don't actually need to worry about curly in that case.", "label": []}
{"id": 10071, "text": "But that one is indeed special case of this one where instead of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> depending on two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they depend on a single variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10072, "text": "Now, of course, you can call variables any name you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 10073, "text": "It doesn't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 10074, "text": "This is just a slight generalization of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 10075, "text": "Well, not quite because here I also had a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10076, "text": "See, I am trying to just confuse you by giving you functions that depend on various numbers of variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 10077, "text": "If you have a function of 30 variables, things work the same way, just longer, and you are going to run out of letters in the alphabet before the end.", "label": []}

{"id": 10084, "text": "Sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 10085, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are dependent on yet another variable then you could get the derivative with respect to that using first the chain rule to pass from <EXPRESSION> to that new variable, and then you would plug in these formulas for partials of f with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10086, "text": "In fact, if you have several substitutions to do, you can always arrange to use one chain rule at a time.", "label": []}

{"id": 10144, "text": "What about when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 10145, "text": "Well then it's <EXPRESSION>, so this is actually undefined, but it's a clue that maybe the slope there if you had a tangent line at that point, maybe it's vertical.", "label": []}
{"id": 10146, "text": "So I'll put that as a question mark, vertical there.", "label": []}
{"id": 10147, "text": "So maybe it's something like that if you actually did have, I guess it wouldn't be a function, if you had some kind of relation that went through it, but let's not draw that just yet.", "label": []}

{"id": 10154, "text": "Well now it's <EXPRESSION>, your slope is now <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 10155, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, if a solution goes through this its slope would look like that.", "label": []}

{"id": 10166, "text": "At negative two two same exact idea, it would look like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 10167, "text": "And so when you keep drawing these line segments over these kind of sample points in the cartesian or in the x-y plane, you start to get a sense of well what would a solution have to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 10168, "text": "And you can start to visualize that hey maybe a solution would have to do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10169, "text": "This would be a solution, so maybe it would have to do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10170, "text": "Or if we're looking only at functions and not relations I'll make it so it's very clear.", "label": []}
{"id": 10171, "text": "So maybe it would have to do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10172, "text": "Or if the function started here based on what we've seen so far maybe it would have to do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10173, "text": "Or if this were a point on the function over here, it would have to do something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 10174, "text": "And once again I'm doing this based on what the slope field is telling me.", "label": []}
{"id": 10175, "text": "So this field that I'm creating where I'm sampling a bunch of points and I'm visualizing the slope with a line segement.", "label": []}
{"id": 10176, "text": "Once again this is called a slope field.", "label": []}
{"id": 10177, "text": "So hopefully that gives you kind of the basic idea of what a slope field is.", "label": []}

{"id": 11138, "text": "What makes it a Markov matrix?", "label": []}
{"id": 11139, "text": "Two properties that this -- this matrix has.", "label": []}
{"id": 11140, "text": "So two properties are -- <EXPRESSION>, every entry is greater = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11141, "text": "All entries greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11142, "text": "And, of course, when I square the matrix, the entries will still be greater/= <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11143, "text": "I'm going to be interested in the powers of this matrix.", "label": []}
{"id": 11144, "text": "And this property, of course, is going to -- stay there.", "label": []}
{"id": 11145, "text": "It -- really Markov matrices you'll see are connected to probability ideas and probabilities are never negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 11146, "text": "The other property -- do you see the other property in there?", "label": []}
{"id": 11147, "text": "If I add down the columns, what answer do I get?", "label": []}
{"id": 11148, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11149, "text": "So all columns add to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11150, "text": "All columns add to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11151, "text": "And actually when I square the matrix, that will be true again.", "label": []}
{"id": 11152, "text": "So that the powers of my matrix are all Markov matrices, and I'm interested in, always, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 11153, "text": "And this question of steady state will come up.", "label": []}
{"id": 11154, "text": "You remember we had steady state for differential equations last time?", "label": []}
{"id": 11155, "text": "When -- what was the steady state -- what was the eigenvalue?", "label": []}
{"id": 11156, "text": "What was the eigenvalue in the differential equation case that led to a steady state?", "label": []}
{"id": 11157, "text": "It was <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11158, "text": "When -- you remember that we did an example and one of the eigenvalues was <EQUATION>, and that -- so then we had an <EXPRESSION>, a constant <EXPRESSION> -- as time went on, there that thing stayed steady.", "label": []}
{"id": 11159, "text": "Now what -- in the powers case, it's not a <EXPRESSION> eigenvalue.", "label": []}
{"id": 11160, "text": "Actually with powers of a matrix, a <EXPRESSION> eigenvalue, that part is going to die right away.", "label": []}
{"id": 11161, "text": "It's an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> that's all important.", "label": []}
{"id": 11162, "text": "So this steady state will correspond -- will be totally connected with an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION> and its eigenvector.", "label": []}
{"id": 11163, "text": "In fact, the steady state will be the eigenvector for that eigenvalue.", "label": []}
{"id": 11164, "text": "Okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 11165, "text": "So that's what's coming.", "label": []}
{"id": 11166, "text": "Now, for some reason then that we have to see, this matrix has an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11167, "text": "This property, that the columns all add to <EXPRESSION> -- turns out -- guarantees that <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue, so that you can actually find the eigenvalue -- find that eigenvalue of a Markov matrix without computing any determinants of <EXPRESSION> -- that matrix will have an eigenvalue of <EXPRESSION>, and we want to see why.", "label": []}
{"id": 11168, "text": "And then the other thing is -- so the key points -- let me -- let me write these underneath.", "label": []}
{"id": 11169, "text": "The key points are -- the key points are <EQUATION> is an eigenvalue.", "label": []}
{"id": 11170, "text": "I'll add in a little -- an additional -- well, a thing about eigenvalues -- key point two, the other eigenval- values -- all other eigenvalues are, in magnitude, smaller than <EXPRESSION> -- in absolute value, smaller than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11171, "text": "Well, there could be some exceptional case when -- when an eigen -- another eigenvalue might have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11172, "text": "It never has an eigenvalue larger than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11173, "text": "So these two facts -- somehow we ought to -- linear algebra ought to tell us.", "label": []}
{"id": 11174, "text": "And then, of course, linear algebra is going to tell us what the -- what's -- what happens if I take -- if -- you remember when I solve -- when I multiply by <EXPRESSION> time after time the K-th thing is <EXPRESSION> and I'm asking what's special about this -- these powers of <EXPRESSION>, and very likely the quiz will have a problem to computer <EXPRESSION>- to computer some powers of <EXPRESSION> or -- or applied to an initial vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 11175, "text": "So, you remember the general form?", "label": []}
{"id": 11176, "text": "The general form is that there's some amount of the first eigenvalue to the K-th power times the first eigenvector, and another amount of the second eigenvalue to the K-th power times the second eigenvector and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 11177, "text": "A -- just -- my conscience always makes me say at least once per lecture that this requires a complete set of eigenvectors, otherwise we might not be able to expand u0 in the eigenvectors and we couldn't get started.", "label": []}
{"id": 11178, "text": "But once we're started with <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then every <EXPRESSION> brings in these <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11179, "text": "And now you can see what the steady state is going to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 11180, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> -- so <EQUATION> and these other eigenvalues are smaller than <EXPRESSION> -- so I've sort of scratched over the equation there to -- we had this term, but what happens to this term -- if the lambda's smaller than <EXPRESSION>, then the -- when -- as we take powers, as we iterate as we -- as we go forward in time, this goes to <EXPRESSION>, Can I just -- having scratched over it, I might as well scratch right?", "label": []}
{"id": 11181, "text": "further.", "label": []}
{"id": 11182, "text": "That term and all the other terms are going to <EXPRESSION> because all the other eigenvalues are smaller than <EXPRESSION> and the steady state that we're approaching is just -- whatever there was -- this was -- this was the -- this is the <EXPRESSION> part of un- of the initial condition <EXPRESSION> -- is the steady state.", "label": []}
{"id": 11183, "text": "This much we know from general -- from -- you know, what we've already done.", "label": []}
{"id": 11184, "text": "So I want to see why -- let's at least see number <EXPRESSION>, why <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue.", "label": []}
{"id": 11185, "text": "And then there's actually -- in this chapter we're interested not only in eigenvalues, but also eigenvectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 11186, "text": "And there's something special about the eigenvector.", "label": []}
{"id": 11187, "text": "Let me write down what that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 11188, "text": "The eigenvector <EXPRESSION> -- <EXPRESSION> is the eigenvector and all its components are positive, so the steady state is positive, if the start was.", "label": []}
{"id": 11189, "text": "If the start was -- so -- well, actually, in general, I -- this might have a -- might have some component <EXPRESSION> always, but no negative components in that eigenvector.", "label": []}
{"id": 11190, "text": "Okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 11191, "text": "Can I come to that point?", "label": []}
{"id": 11192, "text": "How can I look at that matrix -- so that was just an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 11193, "text": "How could I be sure -- how can I see that a matrix -- if the columns add to <EXPRESSION> -- add to <EXPRESSION>, sorry -- if the columns add to <EXPRESSION>, this property means that <EQUATION> is an eigenvalue.", "label": []}
{"id": 11194, "text": "Okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 11195, "text": "So let's just think that through.", "label": []}
{"id": 11196, "text": "What I saying about -- let me ca- let me look at <EXPRESSION>, and if I believe that <EXPRESSION> is an eigenvalue, then I should be able to subtract off <EXPRESSION> times the identity and then I would get a matrix that's, what, -.", "label": []}

{"id": 11204, "text": "I believe it's singular.", "label": []}

{"id": 11209, "text": "So what is it about that matrix?", "label": []}
{"id": 11210, "text": "Well, I guess you could look at its columns now -- what do they add up to?", "label": []}
{"id": 11211, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11212, "text": "The columns add to <EXPRESSION>, so all columns -- let me put all columns now of -- of -- of <EXPRESSION> add to <EXPRESSION>, and then I want to realize that this means <EXPRESSION> is singular.", "label": []}

{"id": 11355, "text": "But let me follow the steady state.", "label": []}
{"id": 11356, "text": "So what -- what's my starting -- my starting <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION> is, shall we say -- shall we put anybody in California?", "label": []}

{"id": 11365, "text": "After one time step, what are the populations at time one?", "label": []}

{"id": 11484, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION> immediately.", "label": []}

{"id": 11509, "text": "Okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 11510, "text": "So Fourier series is -- well, we've got a function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11511, "text": "And we want to write it as a combination of -- maybe it has a constant term.", "label": []}

{"id": 11551, "text": "So what's the analog of addition when you have -- when you're in a continuum?", "label": []}
{"id": 11552, "text": "It's integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 11553, "text": "So that the -- the dot product of <EXPRESSION> functions will be the integral of those functions, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 11571, "text": "And so I -- the end of my lecture is, okay, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 11572, "text": "What's the coefficient -- how much <EXPRESSION> is there in a function compared to the other harmonics?", "label": []}

{"id": 11582, "text": "I take the inner product of everything with <EXPRESSION> Take the inner product of everything with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11583, "text": "Then on the left -- on the left I have -- the inner product is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11584, "text": "And on the right, what do I have?", "label": []}
{"id": 11585, "text": "When I -- so what I -- when I say take the inner product with <EXPRESSION>, let me put it in ordinary calculus words.", "label": []}
{"id": 11586, "text": "Multiply by <EXPRESSION> and integrate.", "label": []}
{"id": 11587, "text": "That's what inner products are.", "label": []}
{"id": 11588, "text": "So if I multiply that whole thing by <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> integrate, I get a whole lot of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 11590, "text": "All the others disappear.", "label": []}

{"id": 11593, "text": "That's our non-interacting.", "label": []}
{"id": 11594, "text": "So what does that mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 11595, "text": "Is that we are thinking about the Hamiltonian for a system of <EXPRESSION> particles.", "label": []}
{"id": 11596, "text": "If they are not interacting, it can be written as the sum of the contributions for the individual particles.", "label": []}
{"id": 11597, "text": "And if they are identical, it's basically the same particle for each one of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 11598, "text": "Same Hamiltonian for each one of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 11599, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11600, "text": "How do we handle these?", "label": []}
{"id": 11601, "text": "Well, if you regard this as a quantum problem, for a single particle-- so for each one of these Hamiltonians-- we can find the eigenstates.", "label": []}
{"id": 11602, "text": "So there's a bunch of states that say label by <EXPRESSION> because we are ultimately have in mind the plane waves that describe gas particles in a box.", "label": []}
{"id": 11603, "text": "And there is corresponding energy levels for the single particles, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11604, "text": "And the single particle spectrum can therefore can be described by a bunch of energies, a lot of energy levels, with different values of <EXPRESSION> and different allowed discretized energies.", "label": []}
{"id": 11605, "text": "Now, when we want to describe a case of <EXPRESSION> particles that are non-interacting, we said that we could, in principle, pick one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 11606, "text": "And if we are dealing with bosons, potentially more than one at each side.", "label": []}
{"id": 11607, "text": "And so the state would then be described by a bunch of occupation numbers <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11608, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> if you are talking about fermions, but any integer if you are talking about bosons.", "label": []}
{"id": 11609, "text": "So this <EXPRESSION> being plus or minus was used to distinguish appropriate symmetrization or anti-symmetrization.", "label": []}
{"id": 11610, "text": "Now, once we have a state such as this, clearly the <EXPRESSION> particle hamintonium acting on a state that is symmetrized with these bunch of occupation numbers will give us back this state.", "label": []}
{"id": 11611, "text": "The energy that we would be getting is summing over all possible <EXPRESSION> values, epsilon <EXPRESSION> times the number of occurrance of that in this state.", "label": []}
{"id": 11612, "text": "Again, multiplying this state back.", "label": []}
{"id": 11613, "text": "Of course, we have a constraint that the number of particles matches the sum of the occupation numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 11614, "text": "So then we said, OK, this is just a description of the state that they want to describe, or the set of states that represent this system of identical non-interacting partners in quantum mechanics.", "label": []}
{"id": 11615, "text": "So the next stage, we want to do some kind of first statistics for them.", "label": []}
{"id": 11616, "text": "And we had seen that basically, in order to assign appropriate statistics in case of quantum systems, we have to deal with a density matrix.", "label": []}
{"id": 11617, "text": "And we saw that in the canonical representation, the density matrix is complicated and amounts to some kind of interaction among particles.", "label": []}
{"id": 11618, "text": "Although there is no interaction at this level, the symmetrization or anti-symmetrization create states that are intermixed in a manner that appears as if you have an interaction.", "label": []}
{"id": 11619, "text": "We found that, however, we could get rid of that by going to the grand canonical ensemble where we would trade in the constraint that the number of particles is fixed with a chemical potential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11620, "text": "And in this ensemble, we found that the density matrix is diagonal in this representation.", "label": []}
{"id": 11621, "text": "So the diagonal elements can be thought of as the probability of one of these occupation number sets.", "label": []}
{"id": 11622, "text": "And so the probability of a particular set of occupations in this grand canonical prescription is proportional to e to the beta-- of course we have mu if we are going to this grand canonical ensemble-- <EXPRESSION>, and then we had <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11623, "text": "So the probability that a particular one of these is occupied <EXPRESSION> times in this grand canonical prescription is simply an exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11624, "text": "And of course, the different <EXPRESSION> levels are completely independent of each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 11625, "text": "So the probability factor arises in this fashion.", "label": []}
{"id": 11626, "text": "Of course, as any probability, we have to normalize this.", "label": []}
{"id": 11627, "text": "Normalization is appropriate.", "label": []}
{"id": 11628, "text": "We call the grand canonical partition function and will be different whether we are dealing with boson statistics or fermion statistics.", "label": []}
{"id": 11629, "text": "Actually, because we have a structure such as this, Q is going to be the product of the normalization of each individual one.", "label": []}
{"id": 11630, "text": "And therefore, <EXPRESSION> is going to be a sum of the contributions that I would get for the normalization of each individual ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 11631, "text": "And of course, the log of whatever normalization I have for the individual one.", "label": []}
{"id": 11632, "text": "If I have the case of a fermions where <EXPRESSION> gets <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> as the two possibilities, then the normalization will be simply <EXPRESSION> plus this exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11633, "text": "And I choose to write that as <EXPRESSION> where I have introduced <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11634, "text": "Because this combination occurs all the time, I don't want to keep repeating that.", "label": []}
{"id": 11635, "text": "So this was for the case of fermions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11636, "text": "For the case of bosons where <EXPRESSION> goes <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, et cetera, this is a geometric series.", "label": []}
{"id": 11637, "text": "For the geometric series, when I sum it, I would get <EXPRESSION> over this factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 11638, "text": "So when I take the log I will have a minus sign here.", "label": []}
{"id": 11639, "text": "And I can put the Boson and Fermi cases together by simply putting a factor of <EXPRESSION> here so that I have the plus for the case of fermions and the minus for the case of bosons.", "label": []}
{"id": 11640, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11641, "text": "So this is one thing that we will be using.", "label": []}
{"id": 11642, "text": "The other thing is that this is the probability for this level having a certain occupation number.", "label": []}
{"id": 11643, "text": "In k we can always ask, what is the average of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 11644, "text": "And from this probability it is easy to calculate the average.", "label": []}
{"id": 11645, "text": "And the answer, again, can be collapsed into one expression for the case of bosons and fermions as <EXPRESSION> encompassing both fermions and bosons.", "label": []}
{"id": 11646, "text": "So these results give some idea both at the microscopic level-- in terms of occupation numbers of these different levels-- and macroscopic level a grand partition function from which we can construct thermodynamics.", "label": []}
{"id": 11647, "text": "Actually, full probability, again, in this ensemble which we can transform in principle and get density matrices, et cetera, in other basis.", "label": []}
{"id": 11648, "text": "But these are the kinds of things that we can do for any interacting Hamiltonian.", "label": []}
{"id": 11649, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11650, "text": "Now, what I said over here was that I'm actually interested in the case of a gas.", "label": []}
{"id": 11651, "text": "So let's again think about the type of gas such as the one in this room that we are interested.", "label": []}

{"id": 11653, "text": "So the Hamiltonian <EXPRESSION> is essentially free particle in a box of volume <EXPRESSION>, the thing that we have been using all the time, just the kinetic energy of a one particle state.", "label": []}

{"id": 11655, "text": "As three components, in fact.", "label": []}
{"id": 11656, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11657, "text": "And we've discussed what the discretization of <EXPRESSION> is appropriate to the size of the box.", "label": []}
{"id": 11658, "text": "We won't go over that.", "label": []}
{"id": 11659, "text": "So again, maybe it is important to mention that because of the discretizatoin of the <EXPRESSION> values, the spacing between possible values of <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION> in each direction.", "label": []}

{"id": 11661, "text": "So these go over to an integral over <EXPRESSION> times the density factor that you get in going from the sum to the integral, which is <EXPRESSION> times the volume.", "label": []}
{"id": 11662, "text": "I will introduce one other factor here, which is that when we are talking about quantum particles and bosons and fermions, they are typically assigned also another state-- another parameter-- that characterizes their spin.", "label": []}
{"id": 11663, "text": "And depending on the possible values of spin, you will have <EXPRESSION> copies of the system.", "label": []}
{"id": 11664, "text": "And this <EXPRESSION> will be related to the quantum spin-- to the formula <EXPRESSION>-- so that when you have fermions, typically <EXPRESSION> is half integer and this will be an even number.", "label": []}
{"id": 11665, "text": "Whereas for bosons it will be an odd number.", "label": []}
{"id": 11666, "text": "So that's, again, something that we've seen.", "label": []}
{"id": 11667, "text": "You just, essentially says multiply everything by some factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11668, "text": "Now if I go through this procedure that I have outlined here, I will ultimately get the grand partition function of the gas-- which as we will see is related to its pressure-- in terms of the chemical potential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11669, "text": "Throughout the course we've seen that the more interesting thing to look at is how things depend on density rather than chemical potential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11670, "text": "So I'd better use this result to get what the density is.", "label": []}
{"id": 11671, "text": "How do I do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 11672, "text": "Well, once I have determined what the chemical potential is, the average number of particles will be the sum over and the average occupation numbers that I have in all of these states.", "label": []}

{"id": 11692, "text": "Now, I realize that <EXPRESSION> is in fact <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11693, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> I can put in the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 11694, "text": "And then I remember that actually the combination <EXPRESSION>, I was calling these thermal wavelength <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11695, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> should have the dimensions of an inverse landscape, so that's the appropriate thing to choose.", "label": []}
{"id": 11696, "text": "So what do I get?", "label": []}
{"id": 11697, "text": "I take <EXPRESSION> inside and I'm left with <EXPRESSION> divided by this parameter <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11698, "text": "Again, for later clarity, let's make sure we remember this was our <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11699, "text": "So this is the variable <EXPRESSION> that I need.", "label": []}
{"id": 11700, "text": "In fact, for the-- for the integration I have to also make a change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11701, "text": "So I not that <EXPRESSION>, if I take a derivative here, I will get <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11702, "text": "Actually, the factor that I need over here is <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11703, "text": "Now everything only depends on the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11704, "text": "So I will take advantage of spherical symmetry, write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11705, "text": "And then I substitute from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> above in terms of this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 11709, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11710, "text": "So you can see lots of things cancel out and the answer is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11711, "text": "And what is left from all of these <EXPRESSION> et cetera, is a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 11713, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11714, "text": "So if I do these set of changes that I have on the right part of the board, what do I have for density?", "label": []}

{"id": 11722, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11723, "text": "And in the denominator, what do I have?", "label": []}
{"id": 11724, "text": "I have <EXPRESSION> universe into the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11725, "text": "So we did all of these and we ended up with an integral that we don't recognize.", "label": []}
{"id": 11726, "text": "So what we are going to do is to pretend that we recognize it and give it a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 11727, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 11728, "text": "So we define a set of functions <EXPRESSION> of variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11729, "text": "Once I do the integration over <EXPRESSION>, I will get a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11730, "text": "So that function of <EXPRESSION> I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11731, "text": "But clearly I have a different <EXPRESSION> if I have <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> for bosons of fermions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11732, "text": "So there is two classes of things.", "label": []}
{"id": 11733, "text": "What's this <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 11734, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 11735, "text": "So here I had the integral <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11736, "text": "It turns out that you will get a whole bunch of these integrals where the [INAUDIBLE] that is out front in the numerator is different.", "label": []}
{"id": 11737, "text": "So I will generalize this <EXPRESSION>, this <EXPRESSION> to something that I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11738, "text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11739, "text": "And if these normalized so that what is in front is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11740, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11741, "text": "So these are very important functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11742, "text": "Everything we will do later on we will be expressing in terms of these functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11743, "text": "Now, clearly what is happening here corresponds to <EXPRESSION> being = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> being <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11744, "text": "What is this normalization?", "label": []}
{"id": 11745, "text": "Well, for the normalization, if this is <EXPRESSION> I would need <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11746, "text": "And if you go and look at the various definitions that we have for the gamma function or the factorial, you can check that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11747, "text": "And, indeed, we saw this already when we wrote the expression for the surface area in general dimensions that involved factorial function appearing as fractions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11748, "text": "And in order to get the right result in two or three dimensions, you can check that this <EXPRESSION> is correct.", "label": []}
{"id": 11749, "text": "So, indeed, I already have this <EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 11750, "text": "It was properly normalized.", "label": []}
{"id": 11751, "text": "So the whole thing here can be written as <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11752, "text": "That is the expression that relates the density to the chemical potential or this communication <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> or the fugacity is simply this nice formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 11753, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11754, "text": "But what we want is to calculate something like the pressure for the gas.", "label": []}
{"id": 11755, "text": "Well, let me remind you that <EXPRESSION>, essentially, quite generally, <EXPRESSION> comes from normalizing something that is like mu times the total number of particles minus the energy-- you can kind of read that from here-- and then there would be <EXPRESSION> from the number of states.", "label": []}
{"id": 11756, "text": "This was the general formula that we had.", "label": []}
{"id": 11757, "text": "And when we substitute for a system that is extensive, where <EXPRESSION> for a gas is <EXPRESSION>, we see that the <EXPRESSION> of the partition function is simply the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11758, "text": "Of course, again, this pressure as a function of density or chemical potential would be different whether we are thinking about bosons of fermions.", "label": []}
{"id": 11759, "text": "But it can be calculated from the kind of sum that we have over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 11760, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 11761, "text": "So I have <EXPRESSION> which is something like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11762, "text": "Is obtained by doing this sum over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11763, "text": "And so what do I get?", "label": []}

{"id": 11768, "text": "Fine.", "label": []}
{"id": 11769, "text": "What do we do with this?", "label": []}
{"id": 11770, "text": "We make the same change of variables that we have over here from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11771, "text": "So then I would have <EXPRESSION> gets replaced with this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11772, "text": "And then I have the integral <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11773, "text": "Huh.", "label": []}
{"id": 11774, "text": "It seems like-- yes?", "label": []}

{"id": 11777, "text": "Good question.", "label": []}
{"id": 11778, "text": "Anything else?", "label": []}
{"id": 11779, "text": "So I was hoping to have integrals that are all expressible in terms of this-- these set of functions that I defined.", "label": []}

{"id": 11781, "text": "Should I define something else?", "label": []}
{"id": 11782, "text": "Well, the answer is no because I can make that integral look like this by simbly doing an integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 11783, "text": "So we do integrate by parts in which case what I do is I take a derivative of this and I take an integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11784, "text": "Integral of <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11785, "text": "There is, of course, a minus sign involved.", "label": []}

{"id": 11791, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> I will bring out front.", "label": []}
{"id": 11792, "text": "So I have <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}

{"id": 11794, "text": "What's the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}

{"id": 11811, "text": "AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: OK.", "label": []}

{"id": 11829, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 11830, "text": "There's one other thing that we can take a look at.", "label": []}
{"id": 11831, "text": "The total energy.", "label": []}
{"id": 11832, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 11833, "text": "So the energy in each one of these states is given by that formula.", "label": []}

{"id": 11836, "text": "Is going to be a sum over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11837, "text": "And this will depend on the statistics that I'm looking at.", "label": []}
{"id": 11838, "text": "And what I will have is that this will go over to an integral over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 11840, "text": "The expectation value of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>-- sorry-- <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11841, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11842, "text": "So the simplest way to do this is to first of all divide by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11843, "text": "So I can define an energy density.", "label": []}
{"id": 11844, "text": "Actually, since I'm going to change variables to this combination that is <EXPRESSION>, I notice that up to a factor of betas the numerator is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11845, "text": "So let me actually calculate the combination <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11846, "text": "That only depends on this combination <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11847, "text": "So what is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 11848, "text": "It is g-- the integral over <EXPRESSION>, I know how to replace it with something that involves <EXPRESSION>-- is going to give me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11849, "text": "Integral <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11850, "text": "From the change of variables, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11851, "text": "But I introduced one factor of <EXPRESSION> here because I have this energy factor in the numerator.", "label": []}

{"id": 11853, "text": "And then again, I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11854, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11855, "text": "So if is one of the integrals that we have defined.", "label": []}
{"id": 11856, "text": "In fact, it is exactly what I have above for the pressure, except that I don't have the factor of <EXPRESSION> that appeared nicely to give the right normalization.", "label": []}
{"id": 11857, "text": "So what I conclude is that this quantity is in fact <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11858, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11859, "text": "But they are exactly the same functions for energy and pressure.", "label": []}
{"id": 11860, "text": "So you can see that, irrespective of what the chemical potential is doing, I can state that for the quantum system <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 11861, "text": "Of course, we have seen this expression classically.", "label": []}
{"id": 11862, "text": "Now what happens quantum mechanically is that the pressure starts to vary in some complicated way with density.", "label": []}
{"id": 11863, "text": "But what we learn is that energy will also vary in the same complicated way with density, such that always this formula <EXPRESSION> is valid.", "label": []}
{"id": 11864, "text": "There is some nice symmetry reason for why that is the case that you explore in one of the problems that you will see.", "label": []}
{"id": 11865, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 11866, "text": "So these are the characteristics.", "label": []}
{"id": 11867, "text": "In some sense we have solved the problem because we know both density and pressure in terms of chemical potential.", "label": []}
{"id": 11868, "text": "So all we need to do is to invert this, get the chemical potential as a function of density, insert it in the formula for pressure and we have pressure as a function of density.", "label": []}
{"id": 11869, "text": "But since these are kind of implicit through these f functions, we don't quite know what that means.", "label": []}
{"id": 11870, "text": "So the next stage is to really study how these f functions behave and how we can relate their behaviors to dependence on density.", "label": []}
{"id": 11871, "text": "And we will see that we have to distinguish between low density and high density regimes.", "label": []}
{"id": 11872, "text": "What does it mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 11873, "text": "Well, you can see that both have players on the right hand side is dimensionless.", "label": []}
{"id": 11874, "text": "The only dimension full combination that we have here is <EXPRESSION>-- well, we can make it dimensionless by multiplying by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12106, "text": "That's going to be our input.", "label": []}
{"id": 12107, "text": "Now, it turns out this is amazingly easy to do because it's an exponential because I write it in exponential form.", "label": []}
{"id": 12108, "text": "The idea is simply to use a rule which, in fact, you know already, the rule of substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12109, "text": "So, I'm going to write the equation in the form, so, there it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12110, "text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12113, "text": "That's the way I write the thing.", "label": []}

{"id": 12115, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, a polynomial in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12121, "text": "All right, so <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12122, "text": "And now, there are just a couple of basic formulas that we're going to use all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 12123, "text": "The first is that if you apply <EXPRESSION> to a complex exponential, or a real one, it doesn't matter, the answer is you get just what you started with, with <EXPRESSION> substituted by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12125, "text": "In other words, put an alpha wherever you saw a <EXPRESSION> in the polynomial.", "label": []}
{"id": 12126, "text": "And, what is this?", "label": []}
{"id": 12127, "text": "Well, this is now just an ordinary complex number, and multiply that by what you started with, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12128, "text": "So, that's a basic formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12129, "text": "It's called in the notes the substitution rule because the heart of it is, you substitute for the <EXPRESSION>, you substitute <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12149, "text": "And, in fact, so if you calculate it out, what is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 12150, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION> times the coefficient plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12182, "text": "You can tell what they are by their color code.", "label": []}
{"id": 12183, "text": "Well, in other words, what I've done is simply write down the solution for you, write down the particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12184, "text": "But let's verify it in general.", "label": []}
{"id": 12185, "text": "So, the proof would be what?", "label": []}
{"id": 12186, "text": "Well, I have to substitute it into the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12187, "text": "So, the equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12260, "text": "Clearly, what we have to do something nice to the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 12261, "text": "So, I'll copy the numerator.", "label": []}

{"id": 12263, "text": "Well, again, don't expand things out because it's already this long.", "label": []}

{"id": 12270, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION>: that's <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12271, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12276, "text": "Well, from here, there's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12277, "text": "I'm expanding that out by the binomial theorem, or whatever you like to call that, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12278, "text": "Is that right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12279, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12280, "text": "So, it is <EXPRESSION>, and now in the denominator I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12281, "text": "I'll put that in the numerator, make it <EXPRESSION>, but I have to divide by the product of <EXPRESSION> and its complex conjugate.", "label": []}
{"id": 12282, "text": "In other words, I'm multiplying both top and bottom by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12283, "text": "And so, that makes here <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12284, "text": "And now, what's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12285, "text": "Now, of that, what we want is just the imaginary part.", "label": []}
{"id": 12286, "text": "Well, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 12287, "text": "<EXPRESSION> goes into <EXPRESSION> makes <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12288, "text": "So, we're practically at our solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12289, "text": "The solution, then, finally, is going to be <EXPRESSION> is the imaginary part of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12290, "text": "And, what's that?", "label": []}
{"id": 12291, "text": "Well, what's the coefficient out front, first of all?", "label": []}
{"id": 12292, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, so let's pull out to <EXPRESSION> before we forget it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12293, "text": "And, we'll pull out the <EXPRESSION> before we forget that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12294, "text": "And then, the rest is simply a question of seeing what's left.", "label": []}
{"id": 12295, "text": "Well, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12296, "text": "I want the imaginary part.", "label": []}
{"id": 12297, "text": "So, the imaginary part is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and then the other imaginary part comes from these <EXPRESSION> pieces, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12298, "text": "And, that should be the particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12299, "text": "Notice that most of the work is not getting this thing.", "label": []}

{"id": 12301, "text": "If we don't like this form, you can put it in the other form, which many engineers would do almost automatically, make it <EXPRESSION>, and what will that be?", "label": []}
{"id": 12302, "text": "Well, you can use the general formula if you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 12303, "text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION> coefficients are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12304, "text": "So, this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12305, "text": "So, it is times, this part makes <EXPRESSION> over the angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 12306, "text": "This is a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12307, "text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12308, "text": "Okay, all right, now let's address the case which is going to occupy a lot of the rest of today, and in a certain sense, all of next time.", "label": []}
{"id": 12309, "text": "What happens when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12310, "text": "Well, in order to be able to handle this decently, it's necessary to have one more formula, which is very slightly more complicated than the substitution rule.", "label": []}

{"id": 12312, "text": "I'm going to call this, or it is called the exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 12313, "text": "So, I'm going to first prove a formula, which is the analog of that, and then I will prove a green formula, which is what to do here if <EXPRESSION> turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12317, "text": "Now, I found I got into trouble by continuing to call that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12318, "text": "So, I'm now going to change the name of <EXPRESSION> to change <EXPRESSION> name to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12325, "text": "This is no worse.", "label": []}
{"id": 12326, "text": "All right, what we going to do?", "label": []}
{"id": 12327, "text": "Well, I'm going to use this exponential shift rule, I'll call it, exponential shift rule or formula or law.", "label": []}
{"id": 12328, "text": "That's the substitution rule for me.", "label": []}
{"id": 12329, "text": "So, this is going to be exponential shift law.", "label": []}
{"id": 12330, "text": "And, to apply, it tells you how to apply the polynomial to not <EXPRESSION>, not just the exponential, but the exponential times some function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12331, "text": "What's that?", "label": []}
{"id": 12332, "text": "And now, the rule is very simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 12333, "text": "See, you can understand the difficulty.", "label": []}
{"id": 12334, "text": "If you try to start differentiating, you're going to have to calculate second derivatives of the stuff, and God forbid, higher order equations.", "label": []}

{"id": 12336, "text": "You barely even want to calculate the first derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12337, "text": "That's okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 12338, "text": "But, second derivative, do I have to?", "label": []}
{"id": 12339, "text": "No, not if you know the exponential shift rule, which says you can get rid of the <EXPRESSION>, make it pass to the left of the operator where it's not in any position to do any harm any longer, or upset the differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12340, "text": "And, all you have to do is, when it passes over that operator, it changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12341, "text": "So, the answer is, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12342, "text": "There, it's passed over.", "label": []}
{"id": 12343, "text": "But, when it did so, it changed <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12344, "text": "And, what about the u?", "label": []}

{"id": 12346, "text": "Nothing happened to it.", "label": []}

{"id": 12350, "text": "So, let's do it just again to give you a chance to try to see, now, if somebody gives you a formula like that, you first stare at it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12351, "text": "You might try a couple of special cases, try it on a function and see if it works, but already, you probably don't want to do that.", "label": []}

{"id": 12355, "text": "A better procedure in trying to understand something like this is say, well, let's keep the u general.", "label": []}
{"id": 12356, "text": "Suppose we make <EXPRESSION> simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 12357, "text": "For example, well, if <EXPRESSION> is a constant, of course there's nothing to happen because if this is just a constant, both sides of these are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 12358, "text": "This doesn't make any sense if <EXPRESSION> doesn't really have a <EXPRESSION> in it.", "label": []}

{"id": 12364, "text": "I'm not going to put in the variable here because it's just a waste of chalk.", "label": []}
{"id": 12365, "text": "Well, what is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 12366, "text": "I know how to calculate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12367, "text": "I'll use the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12368, "text": "So, it's the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12369, "text": "I'll tell you what; let's do the other order first.", "label": []}

{"id": 12375, "text": "I want to make it look like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12376, "text": "Well, to make it look like that I should first factor <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12377, "text": "And now, what's left?", "label": []}
{"id": 12378, "text": "Well, if I factor <EXPRESSION>, what's left is <EXPRESSION>, which is exactly <EXPRESSION> operating on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12379, "text": "Well, hey, that's just what the formula said it should be.", "label": []}
{"id": 12380, "text": "If you make <EXPRESSION> pass over <EXPRESSION>, it changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12381, "text": "Okay, now here's the main thing I want to show you.", "label": []}
{"id": 12382, "text": "All right, now, well let's try, if this is true, also works out for <EXPRESSION>, then the formula is clearly true by linearity because an arbitrary <EXPRESSION> is just a linear combination with constant coefficients of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and that constant thing, which we agreed there was nothing to prove about.", "label": []}
{"id": 12383, "text": "Now, hack, you're a hack if you take <EXPRESSION> and start calculating the second derivative of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12384, "text": "Okay, it's question about hacks.", "label": []}
{"id": 12385, "text": "I mean, it's just, you haven't learned the right thing to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 12386, "text": "Okay, that will work, but it's not what you want to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 12387, "text": "Instead, you bootstrap your way up.", "label": []}
{"id": 12388, "text": "I have already a formula telling me how to handle this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12389, "text": "And, you can be anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 12390, "text": "Look at this not as <EXPRESSION> all by itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 12391, "text": "Calculate, instead, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12392, "text": "Think of that as <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12393, "text": "In other words, we will do it one step at a time.", "label": []}
{"id": 12394, "text": "But you see now immediately the advantage of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12395, "text": "What's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12396, "text": "Well, I just calculated that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12397, "text": "Now, don't go back to the beginning.", "label": []}
{"id": 12398, "text": "Don't go back to here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12399, "text": "Use the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12400, "text": "After all, you worked to calculate it, or I did.", "label": []}
{"id": 12401, "text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> of, and what's this inside?", "label": []}
{"id": 12402, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12403, "text": "Well, that looks like a mess, but it isn't because I'm taking <EXPRESSION> times something.", "label": []}
{"id": 12404, "text": "And I already know how to take <EXPRESSION> times something.", "label": []}
{"id": 12405, "text": "It doesn't matter what that something is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12406, "text": "Here, the something was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12407, "text": "Here, the something is <EXPRESSION> operating on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12408, "text": "But, the principle is the same, and the answer is what?", "label": []}
{"id": 12409, "text": "Well, to take <EXPRESSION> times something, you pass the <EXPRESSION> over the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12410, "text": "That changes <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12411, "text": "And, you apply that to the other guy, which is <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12412, "text": "What's the answer?", "label": []}
{"id": 12413, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12414, "text": "It's just what you would have gotten if you had taken <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>, pass it over, and then changed <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12415, "text": "Now, another advantage to doing it this way is you can see that this argument is going to generalize to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12416, "text": "In other words, you would continue on in the same way by the process of mathematical, one word, mathematical, begins with an I, induction.", "label": []}
{"id": 12417, "text": "By induction, you would prove the same formula for the nth derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12418, "text": "If you don't know what mathematical induction is, shame on you.", "label": []}
{"id": 12419, "text": "But it's okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 12420, "text": "A lot of you will be able to go through life without ever having to learn what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12421, "text": "And, the rest of you will be computer scientists.", "label": []}
{"id": 12422, "text": "Okay, so that's the idea of this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12423, "text": "Now, we can use it to calculate something.", "label": []}
{"id": 12424, "text": "Let's see, I'm going to need green for this, I guess, for our better formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12425, "text": "The formula, now, that tells you what to do if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12426, "text": "So, we're trying to solve the equation, <EXPRESSION>, we are trying to find a particular solution, <EXPRESSION>, let's say.", "label": []}
{"id": 12427, "text": "Remember, <EXPRESSION> is complex.", "label": []}
{"id": 12428, "text": "<EXPRESSION> could be complex.", "label": []}
{"id": 12429, "text": "It doesn't have to be real.", "label": []}
{"id": 12430, "text": "But, the problem is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12431, "text": "How do I get a particular solution?", "label": []}
{"id": 12432, "text": "Well, I will write it down for you.", "label": []}
{"id": 12433, "text": "So, this is part of that exponential input theorem.", "label": []}
{"id": 12434, "text": "I think that's the way it is in the notes.", "label": []}
{"id": 12435, "text": "I gave all the cases together, but I thought pedagogically it's probably a little better to do the simplest case first, and then build up on the complexity.", "label": []}
{"id": 12436, "text": "So, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12437, "text": "The answer is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, except now you have to multiply it by <EXPRESSION> out front.", "label": []}
{"id": 12438, "text": "Where have you done something like that before?", "label": []}
{"id": 12439, "text": "Yes, don't tell me.", "label": []}
{"id": 12440, "text": "I know you know.", "label": []}
{"id": 12441, "text": "But, what should go in the denominator?", "label": []}
{"id": 12442, "text": "Clearly not <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12443, "text": "What goes in the denominator is the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12444, "text": "Okay, but what if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12445, "text": "Couldn't that happen?", "label": []}
{"id": 12446, "text": "Yes, it could happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 12447, "text": "So, we better make cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 12448, "text": "This case is, the case where this is okay corresponds to the case where we're going to assume that alpha is a simple root, is a simple root of the polynomial, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12449, "text": "I don't know what to call the variable, <EXPRESSION> is okay.", "label": []}
{"id": 12450, "text": "A simple <EXPRESSION>, in other words, it's not double.", "label": []}
{"id": 12451, "text": "Well, suppose is double.", "label": []}
{"id": 12452, "text": "One of the consequences you will see just in a second, if it's a simple <EXPRESSION>, that means this derivative is not going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12453, "text": "That's automatic.", "label": []}
{"id": 12454, "text": "Yeah, well, suppose it's not as simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 12455, "text": "Well, suppose is a double root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12456, "text": "How did a-- How did that get changed to, argh! [LAUGHTER] That's not an <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12457, "text": "Oh, well, yes it is, obviously.", "label": []}
{"id": 12458, "text": "Change! All of you, I want you to change.", "label": []}
{"id": 12459, "text": "They should have something like in a search key where <EXPRESSION> occurrences of alpha have been changed to a with a stroke of a, just your thumb.", "label": []}
{"id": 12460, "text": "They don't have that for the blackboard, unfortunately.", "label": []}
{"id": 12461, "text": "Well, too bad, for the future.", "label": []}
{"id": 12462, "text": "Correctable blackboards.", "label": []}
{"id": 12463, "text": "Well, what if a is double root?", "label": []}
{"id": 12464, "text": "It can't be more than a double root because you've only got a quadratic polynomial.", "label": []}
{"id": 12465, "text": "Quadratic polynomials only have two roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 12466, "text": "So, the worst that can happen is that both of them are <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12467, "text": "All right, in that case the formula should be <EXPRESSION> =, you are now going to need <EXPRESSION> up there times <EXPRESSION>, and in the denominator what you are going to need is the second derivative of, evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12468, "text": "Now, you can guess the way this going to go on.", "label": []}
{"id": 12469, "text": "For higher degree things, if you've got a triple root, you will need here <EXPRESSION>, except you're going to need a factorial there, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 12470, "text": "So, don't worry about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12471, "text": "It's in the notes, but I'm not going to give you that for higher roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 12472, "text": "I don't even know if I will give it to you for double root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12473, "text": "Yes, I already did, so it's too late.", "label": []}
{"id": 12474, "text": "It's too late.", "label": []}
{"id": 12475, "text": "Okay, so we will make this two formulas according to whether a is a single or a double root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12476, "text": "Okay, let's prove one of these, and all of that will be good enough for my conscience.", "label": []}
{"id": 12477, "text": "Let's prove the first one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12478, "text": "Mostly, it's an exercise in using the first exponential shift rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12479, "text": "Okay, this will be a first example actually seeing a work in practice as opposed to proving it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12480, "text": "Okay, so what does that thing look like?", "label": []}
{"id": 12481, "text": "So, what does the polynomial look like, which has a as a simple root?", "label": []}
{"id": 12482, "text": "So, we're going to try to prove the simple root case.", "label": []}
{"id": 12483, "text": "So, I'm just going to calculate what those guys actually look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 12484, "text": "What does <EXPRESSION> look like if a is a simple root?", "label": []}
{"id": 12485, "text": "Well, if it's a simple root, that means it has a factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 12486, "text": "When it factors, it factors into the product of <EXPRESSION> times something which isn't, <EXPRESSION> minus some other root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12487, "text": "And, the point is that <EXPRESSION> is not = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12488, "text": "The roots are really distinct.", "label": []}
{"id": 12489, "text": "Okay, what's, then, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to have to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12490, "text": "What is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 12491, "text": "Well, let's calculate <EXPRESSION> first.", "label": []}
{"id": 12492, "text": "It is, well, by the ordinary product rule, it's the derivative of this times, which is <EXPRESSION> plus, that's one thing plus the same thing on the other side, the derivative of this, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12493, "text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12494, "text": "And therefore, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12495, "text": "It's nothing but, this part is <EXPRESSION>, and that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12496, "text": "Of course, this is not <EXPRESSION> because it's a simple root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12497, "text": "And, that's the proof for you if you want, that if the root is simple, that p prime of a is guaranteed not to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12498, "text": "And, you can see, it's going to be <EXPRESSION> exactly when <EQUATION>, and that root occurs twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 12499, "text": "But, I'm assuming that didn't happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 12500, "text": "Okay, then all the rest we have to do is calculate, do the calculation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12501, "text": "So, what I want to prove now is that with this <EXPRESSION>, what I'm trying to calculate that <EXPRESSION> times that guy, <EXPRESSION>, except I'm going to write it as <EXPRESSION>, guess why, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12502, "text": "This is my proposed particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12503, "text": "So, what I have to do is calculate it, and see that it turns out to be, what do I hope it turns out to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 12504, "text": "What the right hand side of the equation, the input?", "label": []}
{"id": 12505, "text": "The input is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12506, "text": "If this is true, then <EXPRESSION>, a particular solution, indeed, nothing will be a particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 12507, "text": "Of course, there could be others, but in this game, I only have to find one particular solution, and that certainly by far is the simple as one you could possibly find.", "label": []}
{"id": 12508, "text": "So, I have to calculate this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12509, "text": "And now, you see why I did the exponential shift rule because this is begging to be differentiated by something simpler than hack.", "label": []}
{"id": 12510, "text": "Okay, you can also see why I violated the natural order of things and put the e to the ax on the left in order that it pass over more easily.", "label": []}
{"id": 12511, "text": "So, the answer on the left-hand side is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12512, "text": "Now, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12513, "text": "Write it in this form.", "label": []}
{"id": 12514, "text": "It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12515, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is, change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12516, "text": "So, the first factor is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12517, "text": "And, what's the second factor?", "label": []}
{"id": 12518, "text": "Change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12519, "text": "It turns into <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12520, "text": "All this is the result of taking that <EXPRESSION>, and changing <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12521, "text": "And now, this is to be applied to what?", "label": []}
{"id": 12522, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is already passed over.", "label": []}
{"id": 12523, "text": "So, what's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12524, "text": "And, that's to be divided by the constant, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12525, "text": "Now, what does this all come out to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 12526, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, what's <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12527, "text": "One, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12528, "text": "And now, what's this thing applied to the constant one?", "label": []}
{"id": 12529, "text": "Well, the <EXPRESSION> kills it, so it has no effect.", "label": []}
{"id": 12530, "text": "It makes it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12531, "text": "The rest just multiplies it by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12532, "text": "So, the answer to the top is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12533, "text": "And, the answer to the bottom is <EXPRESSION>, which I showed you by just explicit calculation is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12534, "text": "And so the answer is, <EXPRESSION> comes out right.", "label": []}
{"id": 12535, "text": "Now, the other one, the other formula comes out the same way.", "label": []}
{"id": 12536, "text": "I'll leave that as an exercise.", "label": []}
{"id": 12537, "text": "Also, I don't dare do it because it's much too close to the problem I asked you to do for homework.", "label": []}
{"id": 12538, "text": "So, let's by way of conclusion, I'll do one more simple example, okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 12539, "text": "And then, you can feel you understand something.", "label": []}
{"id": 12540, "text": "I'm sort of bothered that I haven't done any examples of this more complicated case.", "label": []}
{"id": 12541, "text": "So, I'll pick an easy version instead of the one that you have in your notes, which is the one you have for homework, which is even easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 12542, "text": "So, this one's epsilon less easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 12543, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 12549, "text": "It's a simple root because anybody can see that one is not a double root because you know from critical damping, if one were a double root, you know just what the polynomial would look like, and it wouldn't look like that at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 12550, "text": "It would not look like <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12551, "text": "It would look differently.", "label": []}
{"id": 12552, "text": "Therefore, that proves that <EXPRESSION> is a simple root.", "label": []}
{"id": 12553, "text": "Okay, what's the particular solution, therefore?", "label": []}
{"id": 12554, "text": "The particular solution is <EXPRESSION> divided by the derivative, the derivative evaluated at the point, so, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}

{"id": 12557, "text": "So, if this is to be divided by <EXPRESSION>, in other words, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12558, "text": "And, if you don't believe it, you could plug it in and check it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 12559, "text": "Okay, I'm letting you out one minute early.", "label": []}
{"id": 12560, "text": "Remember that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12561, "text": "I'm trying to pay off the accumulated debt.", "label": []}
{"id": 12562, "text": "PROFESSOR: All right, so let's begin lecture six.", "label": []}
{"id": 12563, "text": "We're talking today about exponentials and logarithms.", "label": []}
{"id": 12564, "text": "And these are the last functions that I need to introduce, the last standard functions that we need to connect with calculus, that you've learned about.", "label": []}
{"id": 12565, "text": "And they're certainly as fundamental, if not more so, than trigonometric functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 12566, "text": "So first of all, we'll start out with a number, <EXPRESSION>, which is positive, which is usually called a base.", "label": []}
{"id": 12567, "text": "And then we have these properties that <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12568, "text": "That's how we get started.", "label": []}
{"id": 12569, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12570, "text": "And of course <EXPRESSION>, not surprisingly, is <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "label": []}
{"id": 12571, "text": "And the general rule is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12572, "text": "So this is the basic rule of exponents, and with these two initial properties, that defines the exponential function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12573, "text": "And then there's an additional property, which is deduced from these, which is the composition of exponential functions, which is that you take <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12574, "text": "Then that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12575, "text": "So that's an additional property that we'll take for granted, which you learned in high school.", "label": []}
{"id": 12576, "text": "Now, in order to understand what all the values of <EXPRESSION> are, we need to first remember that if you're taking a rational power that it's the ratio of <EXPRESSION> integers power of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12577, "text": "That's going to be <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to have to take the nth root of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12578, "text": "So that's the definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 12579, "text": "And then, when you're defining <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is defined for all <EXPRESSION> by filling in.", "label": []}
{"id": 12580, "text": "So I'm gonna use that expression in quotation marks, \"filling in\" by continuity.", "label": []}
{"id": 12581, "text": "This is really what your calculator does when it gives you <EXPRESSION>, because you can't even punch in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12582, "text": "It doesn't really exist on your calculator.", "label": []}
{"id": 12583, "text": "There's some decimal expansion.", "label": []}
{"id": 12584, "text": "So it takes the decimal expansion to a certain length and spits out a number which is pretty close to the correct answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 12585, "text": "But indeed, in theory, there is an <EXPRESSION>, even though the <EXPRESSION> is irrational.", "label": []}
{"id": 12586, "text": "And there's <EXPRESSION> and so forth.", "label": []}
{"id": 12587, "text": "All right, so that's the exponential function, and let's draw a picture of one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12588, "text": "So we'll try, say <EQUATION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12589, "text": "And I'm not going to draw such a careful graph, but let's just plot the most important point, which is the point (0, 1).", "label": []}
{"id": 12590, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12591, "text": "And then maybe we'll go back up here to <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12592, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is this point here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12593, "text": "This is (-1, 1/2), the reciprocal.", "label": []}
{"id": 12594, "text": "And over here, we have <EXPRESSION>, and so that goes all the way up to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12595, "text": "And then exponentials are remarkably fast.", "label": []}
{"id": 12596, "text": "So it's off the board what happens next out at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12597, "text": "It's already above my range here, but the graph looks something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12598, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 12599, "text": "Now I've just visually, at least, graphically filled in all the rest of the points.", "label": []}
{"id": 12600, "text": "You have to imagine all these rational numbers, and so forth.", "label": []}
{"id": 12601, "text": "So this point here would have been (1, 2).", "label": []}
{"id": 12602, "text": "And so forth.", "label": []}
{"id": 12603, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12604, "text": "So that's not too far along.", "label": []}
{"id": 12605, "text": "So now what's our goal?", "label": []}
{"id": 12606, "text": "Well, obviously we want to do calculus here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12607, "text": "So our goal, here, for now - and it's gonna take a while.", "label": []}
{"id": 12608, "text": "We have to think about it pretty hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 12609, "text": "We have to calculate what this derivative is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12610, "text": "All right, so we'll get started.", "label": []}
{"id": 12611, "text": "And the way we get started is simply by plugging in the definition of the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12612, "text": "The derivative is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12613, "text": "So that's what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12614, "text": "And now, the only step that we can really perform here to make this is into something a little bit simpler is to use this very first rule that we have here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12615, "text": "That the exponential of the sum is the product of the exponentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 12616, "text": "So we have here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12617, "text": "So what I want to use is just the property that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12618, "text": "And if I do that, I see that I can factor out a common factor in the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12619, "text": "So we'll write this as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> times this ratio, now <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12620, "text": "So far, so good?", "label": []}
{"id": 12621, "text": "We're actually almost to some serious progress here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12622, "text": "So there's one other important conceptual step which we need to understand.", "label": []}
{"id": 12623, "text": "And this is a relatively simple one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12624, "text": "We actually did this before, by the way.", "label": []}
{"id": 12625, "text": "We did this with sines and cosines.", "label": []}
{"id": 12626, "text": "The next thing I want to point out to you is that you're used to thinking of <EXPRESSION> as being the variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 12627, "text": "And indeed, already we were discussing <EXPRESSION> as being the variable and <EXPRESSION> as being fixed.", "label": []}
{"id": 12628, "text": "But for the purposes of this limit, there's a different variable that's moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 12629, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is fixed and <EXPRESSION> is the thing that's moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 12630, "text": "So that means that this factor here, which is a common factor, is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 12631, "text": "And we can just factor it out of the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 12632, "text": "It doesn't affect the limit at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 12633, "text": "A constant times a limit is the same as whether we multiply before or after we take the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 12634, "text": "So I'm just going to factor that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 12635, "text": "So that's my next step here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12636, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, and then I have the limit <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12637, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12638, "text": "And so what I have here, so this is by definition the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12639, "text": "So here is <EXPRESSION>, and it's = this expression here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12640, "text": "Now, I want to stare at this expression, and see what it's telling us, because it's telling us as much as we can get so far, without some-- So first let's just look at what this says.", "label": []}
{"id": 12641, "text": "So what it's saying is that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times something that we don't yet know.", "label": []}
{"id": 12642, "text": "And I'm going to call this something, this mystery number, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12643, "text": "So I'm gonna make the label, <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of a to the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12644, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12645, "text": "So this is a definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 12646, "text": "So this mystery number <EXPRESSION> has a geometric interpretation, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 12647, "text": "So let me describe that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12648, "text": "It has a geometric interpretation, and it's a very, very significant number.", "label": []}
{"id": 12649, "text": "So let's work out what that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12650, "text": "So first of all, let's rewrite the expression in the box, using the shorthand for this number.", "label": []}
{"id": 12651, "text": "So if I just rewrite it, it says <EXPRESSION> = this factor, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12652, "text": "So the derivative of the exponential is this mystery number times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12653, "text": "So we've almost solved the problem of finding the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12654, "text": "We just have to figure out this one number, <EXPRESSION>, and we get the rest.", "label": []}
{"id": 12655, "text": "So let me point out two more things about this number, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12656, "text": "So first of all, if I plug in <EQUATION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION> , at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12657, "text": "According to this formula, that's <EXPRESSION>, which of course <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12658, "text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12659, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of this function at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12660, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the slope of <EQUATION>, of the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 12661, "text": "The graph of <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12662, "text": "So again over here, if you looked at the picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 12663, "text": "I'll draw the one tangent line in here, which is this one here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12664, "text": "And this thing has slope, what we're calling <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12665, "text": "So, if I graph the function <EQUATION>, I'll get a certain slope here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12666, "text": "If I graph it with a different base, I might get another slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 12667, "text": "And what we got so far is the following phenomenon: if we know this one number, if we know the slope at this one place, we will be able to figure out the formula for the slope everywhere else.", "label": []}
{"id": 12668, "text": "Now, that's actually exactly the same thing that we did for sines and cosines.", "label": []}
{"id": 12669, "text": "We knew the slope of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> function at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12670, "text": "The sine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12671, "text": "The cosine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12672, "text": "And then from the sum formulas, well that's exactly this kind of thing here, from the sum formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 12673, "text": "This sum formula, in fact is easier than the ones for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12674, "text": "From the sum formulas, we worked out what the slope was everywhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 12675, "text": "So we're following the same procedure that we did before.", "label": []}
{"id": 12676, "text": "But at this point we're stuck.", "label": []}
{"id": 12677, "text": "We're stuck, because that time using radians, this very clever idea of radians in geometry, we were able to actually figure out what the slope is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12678, "text": "Whereas here, we're not so sure, what <EXPRESSION> is, for instance.", "label": []}
{"id": 12679, "text": "We just don't know yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 12680, "text": "So, the basic question that we have to deal with right now is what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12681, "text": "That's what we're left with.", "label": []}
{"id": 12682, "text": "And, the curious fact is that the clever thing to do is to beg the question.", "label": []}
{"id": 12683, "text": "So we're going to go through a very circular route here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12684, "text": "That is circuitous, not circular.", "label": []}
{"id": 12685, "text": "Circular is a bad word in math.", "label": []}
{"id": 12686, "text": "That means that one thing depends on another, and that depends on it, and maybe both are wrong.", "label": []}
{"id": 12687, "text": "Circuitous means, we're going to be taking a roundabout route.", "label": []}
{"id": 12688, "text": "And we're going to discover that even though we refuse to answer this question right now, we'll succeed in answering it eventually.", "label": []}
{"id": 12689, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12690, "text": "So how are we going to beg the question?", "label": []}
{"id": 12691, "text": "What we're going to say instead is we're going to define a mystery base, or number <EXPRESSION>, as the unique number, so that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12692, "text": "That's the trick that we're going to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 12693, "text": "We don't yet know what <EXPRESSION> is, but we're just going to suppose that we have it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12694, "text": "Now, I'm going to show you a bunch of consequences of this, and also I have to persuade you that it actually does exist.", "label": []}
{"id": 12695, "text": "So first, let me explain what the first consequence is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12696, "text": "First of all, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then if you look at this formula over here and you write it down for e, you have something which is a very usable formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12697, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12698, "text": "All right, so that's an incredibly important formula which is the fundamental one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12699, "text": "It's the only one you have to remember from what we've done.", "label": []}
{"id": 12700, "text": "So maybe I should have highlighted it in several colors here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12701, "text": "That's a big deal.", "label": []}
{"id": 12702, "text": "Very happy.", "label": []}
{"id": 12703, "text": "And again, let me just emphasize, also that this is the one which at <EQUATION> has slope <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12704, "text": "That's the way we defined it, alright?", "label": []}
{"id": 12705, "text": "So if you plug in <EQUATION> here on the right hand side, you got <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12706, "text": "Slope <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12707, "text": "So that's great.", "label": []}
{"id": 12708, "text": "Except of course, since we don't know what <EXPRESSION> is, this is a little bit dicey.", "label": []}
{"id": 12709, "text": "So, next even before explaining what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12710, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 12711, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 12712, "text": "In fact, we won't get to what <EXPRESSION> really is until the very end of this lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 12713, "text": "But I have to persuade you why <EXPRESSION> exists.", "label": []}
{"id": 12714, "text": "We have to have some explanation for why we know there is such a number.", "label": []}
{"id": 12715, "text": "Okay, so first of all, let me start with the one that we supposedly know, which is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12716, "text": "We'll call it <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12717, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12718, "text": "So that's the first thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 12719, "text": "And remember, that the property that it had, was that <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12720, "text": "That was the derivative of this function, the slope at <EQUATION> of the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 12721, "text": "Of the tangent line, that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12722, "text": "So now, what we're going to consider is any kind of stretching.", "label": []}
{"id": 12723, "text": "We're going to stretch this function by a factor <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12724, "text": "Any number <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12725, "text": "So what we're going to consider is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12726, "text": "If you do that, that's the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12727, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12728, "text": "But now if I use the second law of exponents that I have over there, that's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as some base <EXPRESSION>, where <EXPRESSION> =-- Let's write that down over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12729, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12730, "text": "Right.", "label": []}
{"id": 12731, "text": "So whatever it is, if I have a different base which is expressed in terms of <EXPRESSION>, of the form <EXPRESSION>, then that new function is described by this function <EXPRESSION>, the stretch.", "label": []}
{"id": 12732, "text": "So what happens when you stretch a function?", "label": []}
{"id": 12733, "text": "That's the same thing as shrinking the x axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 12734, "text": "So when <EXPRESSION> gets larger, this corresponding point over here would be over here, and so this corresponding point would be over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12735, "text": "So you shrink this picture, and the slope here tilts up.", "label": []}
{"id": 12736, "text": "So, as we increase <EXPRESSION>, the slope gets steeper and steeper.", "label": []}
{"id": 12737, "text": "Let's see that explicitly, numerically, here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12738, "text": "Explicitly, numerically, if I take the derivative here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12739, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 12740, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 12741, "text": "So the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's the chain rule, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12742, "text": "That's the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, which is what?", "label": []}
{"id": 12743, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12744, "text": "And so if we do it at <EXPRESSION>, we're just getting <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> times this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12745, "text": "So how is it exactly that we cook up the right base <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12746, "text": "So <EQUATION> when <EQUATION> over this number.", "label": []}
{"id": 12747, "text": "In other words, we can pick all possible slopes that we want.", "label": []}
{"id": 12748, "text": "This just has the effect of multiplying the slope by a factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 12749, "text": "And we can shift the slope at <EXPRESSION> however we want, and we're going to do it so that the slope exactly matches <EXPRESSION>, the one that we want.", "label": []}
{"id": 12750, "text": "We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12751, "text": "We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12752, "text": "But at least we know that it's there somewhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 12753, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 12754, "text": "Student: How do you know it's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12755, "text": "PROFESSOR: How do I know?", "label": []}
{"id": 12756, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12757, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12758, "text": "I've decided what <EXPRESSION> is, so therefore there's a formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12759, "text": "And furthermore, by the chain rule, there's a formula for the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 12760, "text": "And it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12761, "text": "So again, scaling does this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12762, "text": "By the way, we did exactly the same thing with the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12763, "text": "If you think of the sine function here, let me just remind you here, what happens with the chain rule, you get <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12764, "text": "So the fact that we set things up beautifully with radians that this thing is, but we could change the scale to anything, such as degrees, by the appropriate factor <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12765, "text": "And then there would be this scale factor shift of the derivative formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 12766, "text": "Of course, the one with radians is the easy one, because the factor is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12767, "text": "The one with degrees is horrible, because the factor is some crazy number like <EXPRESSION>, or something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12768, "text": "Okay, so there's something going on here which is exactly the same as that kind of re-scaling.", "label": []}
{"id": 12769, "text": "So, so far we've got only one formula which is a keeper here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12770, "text": "This one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12771, "text": "We have a preliminary formula that we still haven't completely explained which has a little wavy line there.", "label": []}
{"id": 12772, "text": "And we have to fit all these things together.", "label": []}
{"id": 12773, "text": "Okay, so now to fit them together, I need to introduce the natural log.", "label": []}
{"id": 12774, "text": "So the natural log is denoted this way, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12775, "text": "So maybe I'll call it a new letter name, we'll call it <EQUATION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12776, "text": "But if we were reversing things, if we started out with a function <EQUATION> , the property that it would have is that it's the inverse function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12777, "text": "So it has the property that the <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12778, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12779, "text": "So this defines the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12780, "text": "Now the logarithm has a bunch of properties and they come from the exponential properties in principle.", "label": []}
{"id": 12781, "text": "You remember these.", "label": []}
{"id": 12782, "text": "And I'm just going to remind you of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 12783, "text": "So the main one that I just want to remind you of is that the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12784, "text": "And maybe a few more are worth reminding you of.", "label": []}
{"id": 12785, "text": "One is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12786, "text": "A second is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12787, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12788, "text": "So these correspond to the inverse relationships here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12789, "text": "If I plug in here, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12790, "text": "If I plug in <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, I get the corresponding numbers here: <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12791, "text": "And maybe it would be worth it to plot the picture once to reinforce this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12792, "text": "So here I'll put them on the same chart.", "label": []}
{"id": 12793, "text": "If you have here <EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12794, "text": "It looks like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12795, "text": "Then the logarithm which I'll maybe put in a different color.", "label": []}
{"id": 12796, "text": "So this crosses at this all-important point here, (0, 1).", "label": []}
{"id": 12797, "text": "And now in order to figure out what the inverse function is, I have to take the flip across the diagonal <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12798, "text": "So that's this shape here, going down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12799, "text": "And here's the point (1, 0).", "label": []}
{"id": 12800, "text": "So (1, 0) corresponds to this identity here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12801, "text": "But the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12802, "text": "And notice, so this is <EXPRESSION>, the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12803, "text": "And notice it's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive, which corresponds to the fact that <EXPRESSION> is always positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 12804, "text": "So in other words, this white curve is only above this axis, and the orange one is to the right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12805, "text": "It's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 12806, "text": "Oh, one other thing I should mention is the slope here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12807, "text": "And so the slope there is also going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12808, "text": "Now, what we're allowed to do relatively easily, because we have the tools to do it, is to compute the derivative of the logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 12809, "text": "So to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, we're going to use implicit differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12810, "text": "This is how we find the derivative of any inverse function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12811, "text": "So remember the way that works is if you know the derivative of the function, you can find the derivative of the inverse function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12812, "text": "And the mechanism is the following: you write down here <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12813, "text": "Here's the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12814, "text": "We're trying to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12815, "text": "But now we don't know how to differentiate this equation, but if we exponentiate it, so that's the same thing as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12816, "text": "Because let's just stick this in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12817, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12818, "text": "Now we can differentiate this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12819, "text": "So let's do the differentiation here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12820, "text": "We have <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12821, "text": "And then this, by the chain rule, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12822, "text": "The product of these two factors.", "label": []}
{"id": 12823, "text": "That's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12824, "text": "And now this guy, the one little guy that we actually know and can use, that's this guy here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12825, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12826, "text": "And so finally, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12827, "text": "But what is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 12828, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12829, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12830, "text": "So what we discovered is, and now I get to put another green guy around here, is that this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12831, "text": "So alright, now we have two companion formulas here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12832, "text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12833, "text": "And the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is itself, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12834, "text": "And it's time to return to the problem that we were having a little bit of trouble with, which is somewhat not explicit, which is this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12835, "text": "We want to now differentiate <EXPRESSION> in general, not just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12836, "text": "So let's work that out, and I want to explain it in a couple of ways, so you're going to have to remember this, because I'm going to erase it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12837, "text": "But what I'd like you to do is, so now I want to teach you how to differentiate basically any exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 12838, "text": "So now to differentiate any exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 12839, "text": "There are two methods.", "label": []}
{"id": 12840, "text": "They're practically the same method.", "label": []}
{"id": 12841, "text": "They have the same amount of arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 12842, "text": "You'll see both of them, and they're equally valuable.", "label": []}
{"id": 12843, "text": "So we're going to just describe them.", "label": []}
{"id": 12844, "text": "Method one I'm going to illustrate on the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12845, "text": "So we're interested in differentiating this thing, exactly this problem that I still didn't solve yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 12846, "text": "Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 12847, "text": "So here it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12848, "text": "And here's the procedure.", "label": []}
{"id": 12849, "text": "The procedure is to write, so the method is to use base <EXPRESSION>, or convert to base .", "label": []}
{"id": 12850, "text": "So how do you convert to base <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12851, "text": "Well, you write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> to some power.", "label": []}
{"id": 12852, "text": "So what power is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 12853, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION> to the power <EXPRESSION>, to the power <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12854, "text": "And that is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12855, "text": "So we've made our conversion now to base <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12856, "text": "The exponential of something.", "label": []}
{"id": 12857, "text": "So now I'm going to carry out the differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12858, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12859, "text": "And now, this is a step which causes great confusion when you first see it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12860, "text": "And you must get used to it, because it's easy, not hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 12861, "text": "Okay?", "label": []}
{"id": 12862, "text": "The rate of change of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is, let me do it by analogy here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12863, "text": "Because say I had <EXPRESSION> and I were differentiating it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12864, "text": "The chain rule would say that this is just <EXPRESSION>, the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12865, "text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12866, "text": "So this is the ordinary chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12867, "text": "And what we're doing up here is exactly the same thing, because <EXPRESSION>, as frightening as it looks, with all three letters there, is just a fixed number.", "label": []}
{"id": 12868, "text": "It's not moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 12869, "text": "It's a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 12870, "text": "So the constant just accelerates the rate of change by that factor, which is what the chain rule is doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 12871, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12872, "text": "Same business here with ln a replacing <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12873, "text": "So this is something you've got to get used to in time for the exam, for instance, because you're going to be doing a million of these.", "label": []}
{"id": 12874, "text": "So do get used to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12875, "text": "So here's the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12876, "text": "On the other hand, this expression here was the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12877, "text": "So another way of writing this, and I'll put this into a box, but actually I never remember this particularly.", "label": []}
{"id": 12878, "text": "I just re-derive it every time, is that the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12879, "text": "Now I'm going to get rid of what's underneath it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12880, "text": "So this is another formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12881, "text": "So there's the formula I've essentially finished here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12882, "text": "And notice, what is the magic number?", "label": []}
{"id": 12883, "text": "The magic number is the natural log of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12884, "text": "That's what it was.", "label": []}
{"id": 12885, "text": "We didn't know what it was in advance.", "label": []}
{"id": 12886, "text": "This is what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12887, "text": "It's the natural log of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12888, "text": "Let me emphasize to you again, something about what's going on here, which has to do with scale change.", "label": []}
{"id": 12889, "text": "So, for example, the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12890, "text": "The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, these are the two most obvious bases that you might want to use, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12891, "text": "So one of the things that's natural about the natural logarithm is that even if we insisted that we must use base <EXPRESSION>, or that we must use base <EXPRESSION>, we'd still be stuck with natural logarithms.", "label": []}
{"id": 12892, "text": "They come up naturally.", "label": []}
{"id": 12893, "text": "They're the ones which are independent of our human construct of base <EXPRESSION> and base <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12894, "text": "The natural logarithm is the one that comes up without reference.", "label": []}
{"id": 12895, "text": "And we'll be mentioning a few other ways in which it's natural later.", "label": []}
{"id": 12896, "text": "So I told you about this first method, now I want to tell you about a second method here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12897, "text": "So the second is called logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12898, "text": "So how does this work?", "label": []}
{"id": 12899, "text": "Well, sometimes you're having trouble differentiating a function, and it's easier to differentiate its logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 12900, "text": "That may seem peculiar, but actually we'll give several examples where this is clearly the case, that the logarithm is easier to differentiate than the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12901, "text": "So it could be that this is an easier quantity to understand.", "label": []}
{"id": 12902, "text": "So we want to relate it back to the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12903, "text": "So I'm going to write it a slightly different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 12904, "text": "Let's write it in terms of primes here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12905, "text": "So the basic identity is the chain rule again, and the derivative of the logarithm, well maybe I'll write it out this way first.", "label": []}
{"id": 12906, "text": "So this would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12907, "text": "These are the two factors.", "label": []}
{"id": 12908, "text": "And that's the same thing, so remember what the derivative of the logarithm is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12909, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12910, "text": "So here I have a <EXPRESSION>, and here I have a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12911, "text": "So I'm going to encode this on the next board here, which is sort of the main formula you always need to remember, which is that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12912, "text": "That's the one to remember here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12913, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 12914, "text": "PROFESSOR: The question is how did I get this step here?", "label": []}
{"id": 12915, "text": "So this is the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12916, "text": "The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> is the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect <EXPRESSION>, times the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12917, "text": "That's the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12918, "text": "So now I've worked out this identity here, and now let's show how it handles this case, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12919, "text": "Let's do this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12920, "text": "So in order to get that one, I would take <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12921, "text": "And now let's just take a look at what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 12922, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12923, "text": "Now I claim that this is pretty easy to differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 12924, "text": "Again, it may seem hard, but it's actually quite easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 12925, "text": "So maybe somebody can hazard a guess.", "label": []}
{"id": 12926, "text": "What's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 12927, "text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12928, "text": "So this is the same thing that I was talking about before, which is if you've got <EXPRESSION>, and you're taking its derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> here, that's just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12929, "text": "That's the kind of thing you have.", "label": []}
{"id": 12930, "text": "Again, don't be put off by this massive piece of junk here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12931, "text": "It's a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 12932, "text": "So again, keep that in mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 12933, "text": "It comes up regularly in this kind of question.", "label": []}
{"id": 12934, "text": "So there's our formula, that the logarithmic derivative is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 12935, "text": "But let's just rewrite that.", "label": []}
{"id": 12936, "text": "That's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which is <EQUATION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 12937, "text": "So this is our differentiation formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12938, "text": "So here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12939, "text": "<EQUATION>, if I just multiply through by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12940, "text": "And that's what we wanted.", "label": []}
{"id": 12941, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12942, "text": "So this is the way that logarithmic differentiation works.", "label": []}
{"id": 12943, "text": "It's the same arithmetic as the previous method, but we don't have to convert to base <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12944, "text": "We're just keeping track of the exponents and doing differentiation on the exponents, and multiplying through at the end.", "label": []}
{"id": 12945, "text": "Okay, so I'm going to do two trickier examples, which illustrate logarithmic differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 12946, "text": "Again, these could be done equally well by using base <EXPRESSION>, but I won't do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12947, "text": "Method one and method two always both work.", "label": []}
{"id": 12948, "text": "So here's a second example: again this is a problem when you have moving exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 12949, "text": "But this time, we're going to complicate matters by having both a moving exponent and a moving base.", "label": []}
{"id": 12950, "text": "So we have a function <EXPRESSION>, which is, well maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>, since we already had a function <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12951, "text": "A really complicated looking function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12952, "text": "So again you can handle this by converting to base <EXPRESSION>, method one.", "label": []}
{"id": 12953, "text": "But we'll do the logarithmic differentiation version, alright?", "label": []}
{"id": 12954, "text": "So I take the logs of both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 12955, "text": "And now I differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12956, "text": "And now when I differentiate this here, I have to use the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 12957, "text": "This time, instead of having <EXPRESSION>, a constant, I have a variable here.", "label": []}
{"id": 12958, "text": "So I have two factors.", "label": []}
{"id": 12959, "text": "I have <EXPRESSION> when I differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12960, "text": "When I differentiate with respect to this factor here, I get that <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of that, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12961, "text": "So, here's my formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 12962, "text": "Almost finished.", "label": []}
{"id": 12963, "text": "So I have here <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12964, "text": "I'm going to multiply these two things together.", "label": []}
{"id": 12965, "text": "I'll put it on the other side, because I don't want to get it mixed up with <EXPRESSION>, the quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 12966, "text": "And now I'm almost done.", "label": []}
{"id": 12967, "text": "I have <EQUATION>, and that's just <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12968, "text": "That's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12969, "text": "So these two methods always work for moving exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 12970, "text": "So the next thing that I'd like to do is another fairly tricky example.", "label": []}
{"id": 12971, "text": "And this one is not strictly speaking within calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 12972, "text": "Although we're going to use the tools that we just described to carry it out, in fact it will use some calculus in the very end.", "label": []}
{"id": 12973, "text": "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to evaluate the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12974, "text": "So now, the reason why I want to discuss this is, is it turns out to have a very interesting answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 12975, "text": "And it's a problem that you can approach exactly by this method.", "label": []}
{"id": 12976, "text": "And the reason is that it has a moving exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 12977, "text": "The exponent n here is changing.", "label": []}
{"id": 12978, "text": "And so if you want to keep track of that, a good way to do that is to use logarithms.", "label": []}
{"id": 12979, "text": "So in order to figure out this limit, we're going to take the log of it and figure out what the limit of the log is, instead of the log of the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 12980, "text": "Those will be the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 12981, "text": "So we're going to take the natural log of this quantity here, and that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12982, "text": "And now I'm going to rewrite this in a form which will make it more recognizable, so what I'd like to do is I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>, or maybe I should say it this way: <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12983, "text": "So if <EXPRESSION> is going to infinity, then this <EXPRESSION> is going to be going to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12984, "text": "So this is more familiar territory for us in this class, anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 12985, "text": "So let's rewrite it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12986, "text": "So here, we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12987, "text": "And then that is multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12988, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is the reciprocal of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12989, "text": "Now I want to change this in a very, very minor way.", "label": []}
{"id": 12990, "text": "I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12991, "text": "So that's the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 12992, "text": "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12993, "text": "That's just = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12994, "text": "So this is not a problem, and I'll put some parentheses around it.", "label": []}
{"id": 12995, "text": "Now you're supposed to recognize, all of a sudden, what pattern this fits into.", "label": []}
{"id": 12996, "text": "This is the thing which we need to calculate in order to calculate the derivative of the log function.", "label": []}
{"id": 12997, "text": "So this is, in the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to ,<EXPRESSION> = the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 12998, "text": "Where?", "label": []}
{"id": 12999, "text": "Well the base point is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13000, "text": "That's where we're evaluating it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13001, "text": "That's the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13002, "text": "That's the base value.", "label": []}
{"id": 13003, "text": "So this is the difference quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 13004, "text": "That's exactly what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13005, "text": "And so this by definition tends to the limit here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13006, "text": "But we know what the derivative of the log function is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13007, "text": "The derivative of the log function is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13008, "text": "So this limit is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13009, "text": "So we got it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13010, "text": "We got the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 13011, "text": "And now we just have to work backwards to figure out what this limit that we've got over here is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13012, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13013, "text": "So let's see here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13014, "text": "The log approached <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13015, "text": "So the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13016, "text": "So sorry, the log of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13017, "text": "Yeah, let's write it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13018, "text": "It's the same thing, as well, the thing that we know is the log of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13019, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13020, "text": "And goes to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 13021, "text": "That's the one that we just figured out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13022, "text": "But now this thing is the exponential of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13023, "text": "So it's really <EXPRESSION> to this power here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13024, "text": "So this guy is the same as the limit of the log of the limit of the thing, which is the same as log of the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 13025, "text": "The limit of the log and the log of the limit are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13026, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13027, "text": "Okay, so I take the logarithm, then I'm going to take the exponential.", "label": []}
{"id": 13028, "text": "That just undoes what I did before.", "label": []}
{"id": 13029, "text": "And so this limit is just <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13030, "text": "And so the limit that we want here = .", "label": []}
{"id": 13031, "text": "So I claim that with this step, we've actually closed the loop, finally.", "label": []}
{"id": 13032, "text": "Because we have an honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13033, "text": "The first.", "label": []}
{"id": 13034, "text": "There are many such.", "label": []}
{"id": 13035, "text": "But this one is a perfectly honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13036, "text": "We had this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13037, "text": "We didn't know exactly what it was.", "label": []}
{"id": 13038, "text": "It was this <EXPRESSION>, there was <EXPRESSION>, the logarithm, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 13039, "text": "We have all that stuff.", "label": []}
{"id": 13040, "text": "But we really need to nail down what this number <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13041, "text": "And this is telling us, if you take for example <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be a very good, perfectly decent anyway, approximation to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13042, "text": "So this is a numerical approximation, which is all we can ever do with just this kind of irrational number.", "label": []}
{"id": 13043, "text": "And so that closes the loop, and we now have a coherent family of functions, which are actually well defined and for which we have practical methods to calculate.", "label": []}
{"id": 13044, "text": "Okay, see you next time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13045, "text": "PROFESSOR: Hi, and welcome.", "label": []}
{"id": 13046, "text": "Today we're going to do a problem about least squares approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 13047, "text": "Here's the question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13048, "text": "Find the quadratic equation through the origin that is a best fit for these three points: (1, 1), (2, 5), and (-1, -2).", "label": []}
{"id": 13049, "text": "I'll give you a minute to work that out on your own.", "label": []}
{"id": 13050, "text": "You can hit the pause button now, and we'll be back in a minute to work the problem out together.", "label": []}
{"id": 13051, "text": "OK and we're back.", "label": []}
{"id": 13052, "text": "So what's the first step in a problem like this?", "label": []}
{"id": 13053, "text": "The first step is figuring out what our equation looks like, the one that we're going to find.", "label": []}
{"id": 13054, "text": "So our equation is going to look like <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13055, "text": "So that's what we're looking for.", "label": []}
{"id": 13056, "text": "We're looking for a quadratic equation through the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 13057, "text": "Now, if it were just any quadratic equation, then we would have a constant term, but through the origin just means that the constant term is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13058, "text": "Now, what's the next step?", "label": []}
{"id": 13059, "text": "Next we need to set up a matrix equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13060, "text": "So we need an <EXPRESSION>, a matrix <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13061, "text": "And which matrix is that going to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 13062, "text": "Well, let me start with the first coordinate of these three points.", "label": []}
{"id": 13063, "text": "And I'm going to put them in the first column of this matrix, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13064, "text": "And then my second column is going to be the squares of these coordinates, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13065, "text": "And my <EXPRESSION>-- that's just <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13066, "text": "And my <EXPRESSION>-- this is going to be the second coordinates, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13067, "text": "OK, why did I set this problem up like that?", "label": []}
{"id": 13068, "text": "Well, multiply <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13069, "text": "The first coordinate of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13070, "text": "It's just the same as plugging in this first point into the left-hand side of this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13071, "text": "And similarly, if I took the second point and plugged it in here, I would just get <EXPRESSION>, which is just the same as the second coordinate in the multiplication <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13072, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13073, "text": "OK, and where did the <EXPRESSION> come from?", "label": []}
{"id": 13074, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> came from plugging in these points to the right-hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 13075, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are just the y-coordinates of these three points.", "label": []}
{"id": 13076, "text": "So it would be great if we could solve <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13077, "text": "But we can't solve <EQUATION>, because there isn't a quadratic equation through the origin that contains these three points.", "label": []}
{"id": 13078, "text": "But we need to find the best approximation to that, so that's the same as solving <EXPRESSION> = the projection of <EXPRESSION> onto the column space of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13079, "text": "Because we only have a chance of solving <EXPRESSION> = something if it's in the column space of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13080, "text": "And remember from our projections part of the class that this is the same as solving <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13081, "text": "So that's what we're really going to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13082, "text": "We're really going to solve <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13083, "text": "And now all we have to do is just a computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13084, "text": "So let's do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13085, "text": "So what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13086, "text": "I'm going to do this kind of quickly, because you should be good at multiplying matrices by now.", "label": []}
{"id": 13087, "text": "Oh this-- I have the negative in the wrong place, thank you.", "label": []}
{"id": 13088, "text": "Thanks for that correction.", "label": []}
{"id": 13089, "text": "I have the negative backwards there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13090, "text": "And what do I get when I multiply these?", "label": []}
{"id": 13091, "text": "I'll let you check.", "label": []}
{"id": 13092, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13093, "text": "And what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13094, "text": "Well, if you multiply this out, I'll let you check that you get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13095, "text": "So this is just some computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13096, "text": "And so what we're solving here is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13097, "text": "And we remember how to do this just by using elimination.", "label": []}
{"id": 13098, "text": "We replace the second row by <EXPRESSION> times the second row minus <EXPRESSION> times the first row.", "label": []}
{"id": 13099, "text": "Again, I'm going to do this quickly because you know this from other parts of the class.", "label": []}
{"id": 13100, "text": "You similarly change the b vector, and we backsolve to get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> =-- let's plug that in and see-- think you're going to get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13101, "text": "So what's our final equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 13102, "text": "Our final equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13103, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13104, "text": "So this is our best fit quadratic equation through the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 13105, "text": "Now before I end, let me do a couple things.", "label": []}
{"id": 13106, "text": "First, let me go back and review what the key steps were.", "label": []}
{"id": 13107, "text": "Whenever you're faced with such a best fit equation, first, you want to see what the general form of the equation is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13108, "text": "Next you want to write it in terms of matrices.", "label": []}
{"id": 13109, "text": "Write down your matrix <EXPRESSION> and your vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13110, "text": "And lastly, you set up your projection equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13111, "text": "And then all you have to do is just a computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13112, "text": "But it might also be worth noting that these three points certainly aren't on this quadratic equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13113, "text": "For instance, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I don't get (1, 1), I get (1, 3).", "label": []}
{"id": 13114, "text": "But that's OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13115, "text": "This is as close as we can do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13116, "text": "Thanks.", "label": []}
{"id": 13117, "text": "PROFESSOR: So again, welcome back.", "label": []}
{"id": 13118, "text": "And today's topic is a continuation of what we did last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13119, "text": "We still have a little bit of work and thinking to do concerning polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13120, "text": "So we're going to talk about polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13121, "text": "And my first job today is to talk a little bit about area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13122, "text": "That's something we didn't mention last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13123, "text": "And since we're all back from Thanksgiving, we can certainly talk about it in terms of a pie.", "label": []}
{"id": 13124, "text": "Which is the basic idea for area in polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13125, "text": "Here's our pie, and here's a slice of the pie.", "label": []}
{"id": 13126, "text": "The slice has a piece of arc length on it, which I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13127, "text": "And the area of that shaded-in slice, I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13128, "text": "And let's suppose that the radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13129, "text": "Little <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13130, "text": "So this is a pie of radius <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13131, "text": "That's our picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 13132, "text": "Now, it's pretty easy to figure out what the area that slice of pie is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13133, "text": "The total area is, of course, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13134, "text": "We know that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13135, "text": "And to get this fraction, <EXPRESSION>, all we have to do is take the percentage of the arc of the total circumference.", "label": []}
{"id": 13136, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION> / This is the fraction of area-- sorry, fraction of the total circumference, the total length around the rim.", "label": []}
{"id": 13137, "text": "And then we multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13138, "text": "And that's giving us the total area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13139, "text": "And if you work that out, that's <EXPRESSION> =, the <EXPRESSION> cancel and we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13140, "text": "So here's the basic formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13141, "text": "And now what we need to do is to talk about a variable pie here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13142, "text": "That would be a pie with a kind of a wavy crust.", "label": []}
{"id": 13143, "text": "Which is coming around like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13144, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13145, "text": "The distance from the center is varying with the place where we are, the angle where we're shooting out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13146, "text": "And now I want to subdivide that into little chunks here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13147, "text": "Now, the idea for adding up the area, the total area of this piece that's swept out, is to break it up into little slices whose areas are almost easy to calculate.", "label": []}
{"id": 13148, "text": "Namely, what we're going to do is to take, and I'm going to label it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13149, "text": "I'm going to take these little circular arcs, which go-- So I'm going to extend past where this goes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13150, "text": "And then I'm going to take each circular arc here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13151, "text": "So here's a circular arc.", "label": []}
{"id": 13152, "text": "And then here's another circular arc.", "label": []}
{"id": 13153, "text": "And here's another circular arc.", "label": []}
{"id": 13154, "text": "It's just right on the nose in that case.", "label": []}
{"id": 13155, "text": "Now, in these two cases, so basically the picture that I'm trying to draw for you is this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13156, "text": "I have some sector.", "label": []}
{"id": 13157, "text": "And then I have some circular arc.", "label": []}
{"id": 13158, "text": "And maybe it takes a little extra.", "label": []}
{"id": 13159, "text": "There's a little extra area, I'm making an error in the area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13160, "text": "This is a little extra area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13161, "text": "And maybe to draw it the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13162, "text": "I'm a little short on this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 13163, "text": "And let's say on this one I'm right on the nose.", "label": []}
{"id": 13164, "text": "I have the same arc as the curve of the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 13165, "text": "Now this is a little bit like the step functions that we used in Riemann sums.", "label": []}
{"id": 13166, "text": "It's practically the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13167, "text": "Eventually, this little band of stuff that we're missing by, if we take very, very narrow little slices here, is going to be negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 13168, "text": "It'll get closer and closer to the curve itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 13169, "text": "So that area will tend to <EXPRESSION> in the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 13170, "text": "So we don't have to worry about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13171, "text": "And the approximate relationship is sitting here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13172, "text": "Where this distance now is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13173, "text": "So this radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13174, "text": "And this is this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13175, "text": "And so in the approximate case, what we have is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13176, "text": "Which is practically the same thing we had here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13177, "text": "Except that that <EXPRESSION> is replacing the constant there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13178, "text": "And it's approximately true, because <EXPRESSION> is varying.", "label": []}
{"id": 13179, "text": "And then in the limit, we have the exact formula for the differential.", "label": []}
{"id": 13180, "text": "Which is this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 13181, "text": "So this is the main formula for area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13182, "text": "And if you like, the total area then is going to be the integral from some starting place to some end place of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13183, "text": "Now, this is only useful in the situation that we're in.", "label": []}
{"id": 13184, "text": "Namely-- So this is the other important formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13185, "text": "And this is only useful when <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13186, "text": "When this is the way in which the region is presented to us.", "label": []}
{"id": 13187, "text": "So that's the setup.", "label": []}
{"id": 13188, "text": "And that's our main formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13189, "text": "Let's do what example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13190, "text": "The example that I'm going to take is the one that we did at the end of last time, or near the end of last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13191, "text": "Which was this formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13192, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13193, "text": "Remember, that was the same as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13194, "text": "So this is what we did last time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13195, "text": "We connected this rectangular representation to that polar representation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13196, "text": "And the picture is of a circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13197, "text": "Where this is the point (2a, 0).", "label": []}
{"id": 13198, "text": "So let's figure out what the area is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13199, "text": "Well, first of all, we have to figure out when we sweep out the area, we have to realize that we only go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13200, "text": "So that's something we can get from the picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 13201, "text": "You can also get it directly from this formula if you realize that <EXPRESSION> is positive in this range here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13202, "text": "And at the ends, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13203, "text": "So the thing encloses a region at these ends.", "label": []}
{"id": 13204, "text": "So at the ends, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13205, "text": "That's what cinches this up like a little sack, if you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 13206, "text": "So the area is now going to be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13207, "text": "Question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13208, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: How do I know from looking at the picture that I'm going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, is the question.", "label": []}

{"id": 13214, "text": "that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 13223, "text": "At <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13224, "text": "So you need to know that in order to understand the range.", "label": []}
{"id": 13225, "text": "Another question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13226, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So when we're doing these, should we just guess that it's going to be a loop?", "label": []}
{"id": 13227, "text": "I'm probably going to give you some clues as to what's going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 13228, "text": "Because it's very hard to figure these things out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13229, "text": "Sometimes it'll be bounded by one curve and another curve, and I'll say it's the thing in between those two curves.", "label": []}
{"id": 13230, "text": "That's the kind of thing that I could do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13231, "text": "Here, you really should know this one in advance.", "label": []}
{"id": 13232, "text": "This is by far the most-- or this is one of the typical cases, anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 13233, "text": "I'm going to give you a couple more examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 13234, "text": "Don't get too worked up over this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13235, "text": "You will somehow be able to visualize it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13236, "text": "I'll give you some examples to help you out with it later.", "label": []}
{"id": 13237, "text": "So here's the situation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13238, "text": "Here's my integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 13239, "text": "And now we're faced with a trig integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 13240, "text": "Which we have to remember how to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13241, "text": "Now, the trig integral here-- so first let me factor out the constants.", "label": []}
{"id": 13242, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13243, "text": "And now you have to remember what you're supposed to do at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 13244, "text": "So think, if you haven't done it yet, this is practice you need to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13245, "text": "This trig integral is handled by a double angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13246, "text": "As it happens, I'm going to be giving you these formulas on the review sheet.", "label": []}
{"id": 13247, "text": "You'll see they're written on the review sheet.", "label": []}
{"id": 13248, "text": "At least in some form.", "label": []}
{"id": 13249, "text": "So for example, there's a formula, and this will be on the exam, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 13250, "text": "So this is the correct formula to use here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13251, "text": "Is that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13252, "text": "So that's the substitution that you use for the <EXPRESSION> in order to integrate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13253, "text": "That serves as a little review of trig integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 13254, "text": "And now, this is quite easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13255, "text": "This integral now is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13256, "text": "Why is it easy?", "label": []}
{"id": 13257, "text": "Well, because it's the antiderivative of a constant, <EXPRESSION>, its antiderivative you're supposed to be able to write down.", "label": []}
{"id": 13258, "text": "So the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13259, "text": "And the antiderivative of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the sine when it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13260, "text": "And that is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13261, "text": "And the signs go away because they're both <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13262, "text": "So all told we get <EXPRESSION>, which is certainly what we would like it to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 13263, "text": "It's the area of the circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13264, "text": "Another question?", "label": []}
{"id": 13265, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question, so I'm not sure which question you're asking.", "label": []}
{"id": 13266, "text": "I pivoted my arm around (0, 0).", "label": []}
{"id": 13267, "text": "This point, this is the point we're talking about, (0, 0), is a key point.", "label": []}
{"id": 13268, "text": "It's where I guess you could say I stuck my elbow there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13269, "text": "Now, the reason is that it's the place where <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13270, "text": "So it's more or less the center of the universe from the point of view of this problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 13271, "text": "So it's the reference point and if you like, when you're doing this, it's a little bit like a radar screen.", "label": []}
{"id": 13272, "text": "Everything is centered at the origin and you're taking rays coming out from it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13273, "text": "And seeing where they're going to go.", "label": []}
{"id": 13274, "text": "So for example, this is the <EQUATION> ray, this is the <EQUATION> ray.", "label": []}
{"id": 13275, "text": "This the <EQUATION> ray.", "label": []}
{"id": 13276, "text": "And indeed, if my elbow is right at this center here, I'm pointing in those various directions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13277, "text": "So that's what I had in mind when I did that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13278, "text": "You can always get these formulas, by the way, from the original business, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13279, "text": "But it's useful to have the geometric picture as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 13280, "text": "In other words, if you were a machine you'd have to rely on these formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 13281, "text": "And plot things using these.", "label": []}
{"id": 13282, "text": "Always.", "label": []}
{"id": 13283, "text": "Now, in terms of plotting I want to expand your brain a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 13284, "text": "So we need just a little bit more practice with plotting.", "label": []}
{"id": 13285, "text": "In polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13286, "text": "And so, the first question that I want to ask you is, what happens outside of this range of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13287, "text": "In other words, what happens if <EXPRESSION> beyond <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13288, "text": "Can somebody see what's happening to the formulas in that case?", "label": []}
{"id": 13289, "text": "So what I'm looking at now, let's go back to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13290, "text": "What I'm looking at is this formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13291, "text": "But to use the elbow analogy here, I'm swept around like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13292, "text": "But now I'm going to point this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13293, "text": "I'm going to point out over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13294, "text": "My hand is up here in the northwest direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 13295, "text": "So what's going to happen?", "label": []}
{"id": 13296, "text": "Somebody want to tell me?", "label": []}
{"id": 13297, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: It goes around itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 13298, "text": "That's right.", "label": []}
{"id": 13299, "text": "What happens is that when <EXPRESSION> crosses this vertical, <EQUATION>, when it crosses over here it goes negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 13300, "text": "So although my theta is pointing me this way, the thing is going to go backwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 13301, "text": "And there's another clue.", "label": []}
{"id": 13302, "text": "Which is very important.", "label": []}
{"id": 13303, "text": "How far backwards is it going?", "label": []}
{"id": 13304, "text": "Well, you don't actually need to know anything but this equation here, to understand that it has to be on the same circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13305, "text": "So when I'm pointing this way, the things points backwards to this point over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13306, "text": "So what happens is, it goes around once.", "label": []}
{"id": 13307, "text": "And then when I point out this way, it sweeps around a second time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13308, "text": "It just keeps on going around the same circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13309, "text": "So over here it's empty.", "label": []}
{"id": 13310, "text": "Because it's pointing the other way and it's sweeping around the same curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 13311, "text": "A second time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13312, "text": "Now, if you were foolish enough to integrate, say, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> or some wider range, what would happen is you would just double the area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13313, "text": "Because you would have swept it out twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 13314, "text": "So that's the mistake that you'll make.", "label": []}
{"id": 13315, "text": "Sometimes you'll count things as negative and positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 13316, "text": "But because there's a square here, it's always a positive quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 13317, "text": "And you'll always over-count if you go too far.", "label": []}
{"id": 13318, "text": "So that's what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 13319, "text": "Again, it sweeps out the same region.", "label": []}
{"id": 13320, "text": "That's because these two equations really are equivalent to each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 13321, "text": "It's just that this one sweeps it out twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 13322, "text": "And this one doesn't say how it's sweeping it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13323, "text": "Yeah, another question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13324, "text": "STUDENT: Doesn't this equation also work if you just go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13325, "text": "PROFESSOR: Does the integration work if you just go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 13326, "text": "The answer is yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13327, "text": "That's a very weird object, though.", "label": []}
{"id": 13328, "text": "Let me just show you what that is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13329, "text": "If you started from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13330, "text": "So I'll illustrate it on here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13331, "text": "The first thing that you swept out between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is this part here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13332, "text": "That was swept out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13333, "text": "And then, when you're going around this next quadrant here, you're actually sweeping out this underside here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13334, "text": "So actually, you're getting it because you're getting half of it on one half, and getting the other half on the other quadrant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13335, "text": "So it's actually giving you the right answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 13336, "text": "That turns out to be OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13337, "text": "It's a little weird way to chop up a circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13338, "text": "But it's legal.", "label": []}
{"id": 13339, "text": "But of course, that's an accident of this particular figure.", "label": []}
{"id": 13340, "text": "You can't count on that happening.", "label": []}
{"id": 13341, "text": "It's much better to line it up exactly with what the figure does.", "label": []}
{"id": 13342, "text": "So don't do that too often.", "label": []}
{"id": 13343, "text": "You might run into troubles.", "label": []}
{"id": 13344, "text": "So I'm going to give you a couple more examples of practice with these pictures.", "label": []}
{"id": 13345, "text": "And maybe I'm going to get rid of this one up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13346, "text": "So here's another favorite.", "label": []}
{"id": 13347, "text": "Here's another favorite.", "label": []}
{"id": 13348, "text": "So this, if you like, is Example 2.", "label": []}
{"id": 13349, "text": "I guess we had an Example 1 up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13350, "text": "And now we're really not going to try to do any more area examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 13351, "text": "The area examples are actually straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 13352, "text": "It's really just figuring out what the picture looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 13353, "text": "So this is examples of drawings.", "label": []}
{"id": 13354, "text": "So this one is one that's kind of fun to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13355, "text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13356, "text": "Something like this is on your homework.", "label": []}
{"id": 13357, "text": "And so what happens here is the following.", "label": []}
{"id": 13358, "text": "What happens here is that at <EQUATION>, that's the first place.", "label": []}
{"id": 13359, "text": "So let's just plot a few places here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13360, "text": "I'm not going to plot very many.", "label": []}
{"id": 13361, "text": "<EQUATION>, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13362, "text": "Whoops, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13363, "text": "Sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 13364, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION>, that's where I get <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13365, "text": "For this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13366, "text": "And then again, at <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>, which is back at <EXPRESSION> again.", "label": []}
{"id": 13367, "text": "So it's-- And the other thing to say is in between here it's positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 13368, "text": "In between.", "label": []}
{"id": 13369, "text": "So what it does is, it starts out at <EXPRESSION> and it goes out to the radius <EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13370, "text": "And then it comes back.", "label": []}
{"id": 13371, "text": "So it does something like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13372, "text": "It goes out, and it comes back.", "label": []}
{"id": 13373, "text": "Now because of the symmetries of the sine function, this is pretty much all you need to know.", "label": []}
{"id": 13374, "text": "It does something similar in all of the quadrants.", "label": []}
{"id": 13375, "text": "But in order to see what it's doing, it's useful for you to watch me draw it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13376, "text": "Because the order is very important for understanding what it's doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13377, "text": "It's similar to this weird business with the circle here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13378, "text": "So watch me draw this guy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13379, "text": "I'll draw it in red because it usually has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 13380, "text": "So here it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13381, "text": "It does this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13382, "text": "And then it does this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13383, "text": "And then it does this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13384, "text": "And then it does that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13385, "text": "So it's called a four-leaf rose.", "label": []}
{"id": 13386, "text": "I drew it in pink because it's kind of a rose here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13387, "text": "So it started out over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13388, "text": "This is Step 1.", "label": []}
{"id": 13389, "text": "And this is the range <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13390, "text": "It did this part here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13391, "text": "And then it went <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13392, "text": "So I should draw these in white, because they're harder to read in red.", "label": []}
{"id": 13393, "text": "But now look at what it did.", "label": []}
{"id": 13394, "text": "It did not make a right angle turn.", "label": []}
{"id": 13395, "text": "It was nice and smooth.", "label": []}
{"id": 13396, "text": "It went around here and then it went down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13397, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13398, "text": "Back here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13399, "text": "And then over here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13400, "text": "Back up here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13401, "text": "And then around here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13402, "text": "And down here, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13403, "text": "And then back where it started and goes around again.", "label": []}
{"id": 13404, "text": "And this is because actually it's switching sign when it crosses the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 13405, "text": "When it was over in this quadrant the first time, it actually was tracing what's directly behind it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13406, "text": "So this is kind of amusing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13407, "text": "From this little tiny formula you get this pretty diagram here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13408, "text": "Anyway that's, as I say, an old favorite.", "label": []}
{"id": 13409, "text": "And here if you want to do the area of one leaf, you've got to make sure you understand that it's a small piece of the whole.", "label": []}
{"id": 13410, "text": "OK, now I have one last drawing example that I want to discuss with you.", "label": []}
{"id": 13411, "text": "And it involves another skill that we haven't quite gotten enough practice with.", "label": []}
{"id": 13412, "text": "So I'm going to do that one.", "label": []}
{"id": 13413, "text": "And it's also preparation for an exercise.", "label": []}
{"id": 13414, "text": "But one that we're going to do after the test.", "label": []}
{"id": 13415, "text": "So here's my last example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13416, "text": "We're going to discuss what happens with this function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13417, "text": "Sorry, that's not legible, is it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13418, "text": "That's a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13419, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13420, "text": "Now, the first thing I want to do is just take our time a little bit and plot a few points.", "label": []}
{"id": 13421, "text": "So here's the values of <EXPRESSION> and here are the values of <EXPRESSION>, and we'll see what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 13422, "text": "And we'll try to figure out what it's doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13423, "text": "When <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13424, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13425, "text": "The denominator is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13426, "text": "If theta-- I'm going to make it easy, we're not going to do so many.", "label": []}
{"id": 13427, "text": "I'm going to do <EXPRESSION>, that's an easy value of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13428, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13429, "text": "So that value of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13430, "text": "And now I'm going to back up and do <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13431, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, again, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13432, "text": "And <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13433, "text": "So now I'd like to just plot those points anyway, and see what's going on with this expression here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13434, "text": "The first one is a rectangular-- I'm going to write the rectangular coordinates here, not the polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13435, "text": "The rectangular coordinates here are <EXPRESSION> out at the horizontal, so it's (1/3, 0).", "label": []}
{"id": 13436, "text": "The polar coordinates is (1/3, 0), but the rectangular coordinate is also that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13437, "text": "And over here, at <EXPRESSION>, the distance is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13438, "text": "So this is the point (0, 1) in x-y coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13439, "text": "And then down here at, <EXPRESSION>, it's (0, -1).", "label": []}
{"id": 13440, "text": "Let me just emphasize.", "label": []}
{"id": 13441, "text": "You should be able to think of this visually if you can crank your arm around and think it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13442, "text": "Or if you're right-handed you'll bend that way, no.", "label": []}
{"id": 13443, "text": "Anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 13444, "text": "Or you'll have to use-- But this also works using this formulas <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13445, "text": "Notice that in this case, <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION> but the <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13446, "text": "So you plug in <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 13461, "text": "That's <EQUATION>, so <EXPRESSION> =, it turns out, plus or minus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13462, "text": "Those are the values here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13463, "text": "So when we're out here somewhere, in these directions, there's nothing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13464, "text": "It's going infinitely far out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13465, "text": "Those ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 13466, "text": "OK that's about as much as we'll be able to figure out of this diagram without doing some analytic work.", "label": []}
{"id": 13467, "text": "And that's the other little piece that I want to explain.", "label": []}
{"id": 13468, "text": "Namely, going backwards from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13469, "text": "Which is one thing that we haven't done.", "label": []}
{"id": 13470, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13471, "text": "So what is the rectangular equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 13472, "text": "That means the (x, y) equation for this <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13473, "text": "And let's see what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13474, "text": "Well, first I'm going to clear the denominator here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13475, "text": "This is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13476, "text": "And now I'm going to rewrite it as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13477, "text": "And the reason for that is that in a minute I'll explain to you why.", "label": []}
{"id": 13478, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13479, "text": "And this guy, I'm going to square now.", "label": []}
{"id": 13480, "text": "I'm going to make this <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13481, "text": "And now, with an <EXPRESSION>, I can plug in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13482, "text": "So this is a standard thing to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13483, "text": "And it's basically what you're going to do any time you're faced with an equation like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13484, "text": "Is try to work it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13485, "text": "And, in these situations where you have <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, you'll always come out with some quadratic expression like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13486, "text": "Now, I'm going to combine terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 13487, "text": "So here I have <EXPRESSION>, and put everything on the the left side.", "label": []}
{"id": 13488, "text": "So that's this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13489, "text": "And we recognize, well you're supposed to recognize, that this is what's known as a hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13490, "text": "If the signs are the same, it's an ellipse.", "label": []}
{"id": 13491, "text": "If the the signs are opposite it's a hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13492, "text": "And in between, if one of the coefficients on the quadratic is <EXPRESSION>, it's a parabola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13493, "text": "So now we see that the picture that we drew there is actually, turns out it's going to have asymptotes, it's going to be a hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13494, "text": "So now, let me ask you the last little mind-bending question that I want to ask.", "label": []}
{"id": 13495, "text": "Which is, what happens-- So now I'm using my right arm, I guess.", "label": []}
{"id": 13496, "text": "But my elbow's at the origin here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13497, "text": "What happens if I pass outside, to the range where this denominator is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 13498, "text": "It crossed <EXPRESSION> and it went to negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 13499, "text": "It's sweeping out something over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13500, "text": "Is it sweeping out the same curve?", "label": []}
{"id": 13501, "text": "Anybody have any idea what it's doing?", "label": []}
{"id": 13502, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13503, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.", "label": []}
{"id": 13504, "text": "Good answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 13505, "text": "It's the other branch of the hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13506, "text": "So what's actually happening is in disguise, there's another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13507, "text": "Now, that is consistent with these algebraic equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 13508, "text": "The algebraic equation that I got here doesn't say which branch of the hyperbola I've got.", "label": []}
{"id": 13509, "text": "It's actually got two branches.", "label": []}
{"id": 13510, "text": "And the curve really was, in disguise, capturing both of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 13511, "text": "I want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13512, "text": "Because this is a really beautiful connection.", "label": []}
{"id": 13513, "text": "And I want to make that connection in connection also with this example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13514, "text": "The hyperbolas, as you probably know, are the trajectories of comets.", "label": []}
{"id": 13515, "text": "And ellipses, which is what you would get if maybe you put <EXPRESSION> here instead of a <EXPRESSION>, would be the trajectories of planets or asteroids.", "label": []}
{"id": 13516, "text": "But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.", "label": []}
{"id": 13517, "text": "That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13518, "text": "And what happens when you get the ellipses as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 13519, "text": "Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.", "label": []}
{"id": 13520, "text": "And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13521, "text": "So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 13522, "text": "And pretty much any other.", "label": []}
{"id": 13523, "text": "I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13524, "text": "So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13525, "text": "And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13526, "text": "Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.", "label": []}
{"id": 13527, "text": "Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13528, "text": "The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.", "label": []}
{"id": 13529, "text": "So in = areas, this is amount of area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13530, "text": "So this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this, its speed varies.", "label": []}
{"id": 13531, "text": "And it's speed varies according to a very specific rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 13532, "text": "Namely, this one here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13533, "text": "And this rule was observed by Kepler.", "label": []}
{"id": 13534, "text": "But if you have this connection here, we also have something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 13535, "text": "We also know that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13536, "text": "So that's this formula here, formally dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13537, "text": "That's the rate of change with respect to this time parameter, which is the honest to goodness time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13538, "text": "Real physical time.", "label": []}
{"id": 13539, "text": "And that means, this quantity here is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13540, "text": "And this is one of the key insights that physicists had, long after Kepler made his physical observations, they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all, because it's a frictionless setup.", "label": []}
{"id": 13541, "text": "Outer space, there's no air.", "label": []}
{"id": 13542, "text": "Nothing is going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 13543, "text": "This is what's known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum.", "label": []}
{"id": 13544, "text": "This is the expression for angular momentum.", "label": []}
{"id": 13545, "text": "And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.", "label": []}
{"id": 13546, "text": "Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.", "label": []}
{"id": 13547, "text": "Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.", "label": []}
{"id": 13548, "text": "And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13549, "text": "And it's exactly this polar formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13550, "text": "So that's a neat thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13551, "text": "And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 13552, "text": "So that's it for generalities and a little pep talk on what's coming up to you when you learn a little more physics.", "label": []}
{"id": 13553, "text": "Right now we need to talk about the exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 13554, "text": "So first of all, let me tell you what the topics are.", "label": []}
{"id": 13555, "text": "They're the same as last year's test.", "label": []}
{"id": 13556, "text": "Which you can take a look at.", "label": []}
{"id": 13557, "text": "And let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 13558, "text": "So what did we do?", "label": []}
{"id": 13559, "text": "One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 13560, "text": "And there are three, which we will test.", "label": []}
{"id": 13561, "text": "One is trig substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 13562, "text": "One is integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 13563, "text": "And one is partial fractions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13564, "text": "So that's more than half of the exam, right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13565, "text": "The other half of the exam is parametric curves.", "label": []}
{"id": 13566, "text": "Arc length.", "label": []}
{"id": 13567, "text": "These are all interrelated.", "label": []}
{"id": 13568, "text": "And area of surfaces of revolution.", "label": []}
{"id": 13569, "text": "Those are the only kind that we can handle.", "label": []}
{"id": 13570, "text": "Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.", "label": []}
{"id": 13571, "text": "And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13572, "text": "And area in polar coordinates, including area.", "label": []}
{"id": 13573, "text": "That's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13574, "text": "That's what's on the test, there are six problems.", "label": []}
{"id": 13575, "text": "They're very similar.", "label": []}
{"id": 13576, "text": "Well, they're not actually that similar.", "label": []}
{"id": 13577, "text": "But they're somewhat similar to last year's.", "label": []}
{"id": 13578, "text": "I'd say the test is similar.", "label": []}
{"id": 13579, "text": "Maybe a tiny bit more difficult.", "label": []}
{"id": 13580, "text": "We'll see.", "label": []}
{"id": 13581, "text": "We'll see.", "label": []}
{"id": 13582, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13583, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question was, we didn't do arc length in polar coordinates, did we?", "label": []}
{"id": 13584, "text": "And the answer is no, we did not.", "label": []}
{"id": 13585, "text": "We did not do arc length in polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 13586, "text": "When I give you an exercise, I'm going to ask you about, if you know the speed of a comet here, what's the speed of the comet there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13587, "text": "And we'll have to know about arc length for that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13588, "text": "But we're not doing it on this exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 13589, "text": "Other questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13590, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will I expect you to know <EXPRESSION> =--- so let's see if I can formulate this question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13591, "text": "It's related to this four-leaf rose here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13592, "text": "So the question is, suppose I gave you something that looked like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13593, "text": "Would I expect you to be able to know what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13594, "text": "I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.", "label": []}
{"id": 13595, "text": "I can give you a long time to sketch this out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13596, "text": "And think about what it does.", "label": []}
{"id": 13597, "text": "Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.", "label": []}
{"id": 13598, "text": "And then you have some clue as to what it's doing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13599, "text": "It doesn't have six.", "label": []}
{"id": 13600, "text": "Because of some weird thing, having to do with repetitions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13601, "text": "But the odds and evens work differently.", "label": []}
{"id": 13602, "text": "So, in fact I would have to tell you what the picture looks like, if it's going to be this complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 13603, "text": "Similarly, so this is an important point to make, when we come to techniques of integration, any integral that you have, I'm not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 13604, "text": "But if it's an integral that I think you're going to get stuck on, either I'm going to give you a hint, tell you how to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13605, "text": "Or I'm going to tell you, don't do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13606, "text": "If I tell you don't do it, don't try to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13607, "text": "It may be impossible.", "label": []}
{"id": 13608, "text": "And even if it's possible, it's going to be very long.", "label": []}
{"id": 13609, "text": "Like an hour.", "label": []}
{"id": 13610, "text": "So don't do it unless I tell you to.", "label": []}
{"id": 13611, "text": "On the other hand, all of these setups in this second half of this unit, they involve somehow setting something up.", "label": []}
{"id": 13612, "text": "And they're basically three issues.", "label": []}
{"id": 13613, "text": "One is what the integrand is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13614, "text": "One is what the lower limit is, what is the upper limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 13615, "text": "They're just three things, three inputs, to setting up an integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 13616, "text": "All integrals, this is going to be the setup for all of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 13617, "text": "And then the second step is evaluating.", "label": []}
{"id": 13618, "text": "Which really is what we did in the first half here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13619, "text": "And, unfortunately, we don't have infinitely many techniques and indeed there's some integrals that can't be evaluated and some that are too long.", "label": []}
{"id": 13620, "text": "So we'll just try to avoid those.", "label": []}
{"id": 13621, "text": "I'm not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long.", "label": []}
{"id": 13622, "text": "Alright, other questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13623, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13624, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will the percentages be the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13625, "text": "And the answer is, no.", "label": []}
{"id": 13626, "text": "I'll tell you exactly.", "label": []}
{"id": 13627, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION> points.", "label": []}
{"id": 13628, "text": "Unless I change the point values.", "label": []}
{"id": 13629, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13630, "text": "That's what it came out to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 13631, "text": "You are going to want to know about all of the things that I've written down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13632, "text": "You're definitely going to want to know, for example, surfaces of revolution.", "label": []}
{"id": 13633, "text": "How to set those up.", "label": []}
{"id": 13634, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13635, "text": "there was another question I saw.", "label": []}
{"id": 13636, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13637, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So if you have a partial fraction with something like <EXPRESSION> and maybe an <EXPRESSION> and maybe an <EXPRESSION>, and you're interested in what happens with this denominator here?", "label": []}
{"id": 13638, "text": "So what's going to happen is, you're going to need a coefficient for each degree of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13639, "text": "So altogether, the setup is going to be this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13640, "text": "<EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13641, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13642, "text": "This is the setup.", "label": []}
{"id": 13643, "text": "So you need-- STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: So if I change this to being a <EXPRESSION> here, then I need, I guess I'll have to call it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13644, "text": "I need that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13645, "text": "Now, it gets harder and harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 13646, "text": "The more repeated roots there are, the more repeated factors there are, the harder it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13647, "text": "Because the ones you can pick off by the cover-up method are, is just the top one here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13648, "text": "And these two.", "label": []}
{"id": 13649, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> you can get.", "label": []}
{"id": 13650, "text": "But <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you're going to have to do by either plugging in or some other, more elaborate, algebra.", "label": []}
{"id": 13651, "text": "So the more of these lower terms there are, the worse off you are.", "label": []}
{"id": 13652, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, does this <EXPRESSION> affect this setup.", "label": []}
{"id": 13653, "text": "And the answer is almost no.", "label": []}
{"id": 13654, "text": "That is, not at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 13655, "text": "It's the same setup exactly.", "label": []}
{"id": 13656, "text": "But, there's one thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13657, "text": "If the degree gets too big, then you've got to use long division first to knock it down.", "label": []}
{"id": 13658, "text": "I'll give you an example of this type of practice.", "label": []}
{"id": 13659, "text": "Unless there are more question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13660, "text": "Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 13661, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Are you going to have to know how to do reduction formulas?", "label": []}
{"id": 13662, "text": "Anything that's a little out of the ordinary like a reduction formula, I will have to coach you to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13663, "text": "So, in other words, what you'll have to be able to do in that situation is follow directions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13664, "text": "If I tell you OK, you're faced with this, then do an integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 13665, "text": "And do that, then get the reduction formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13666, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13667, "text": "OK, so the question had do with the partial fractions method.", "label": []}
{"id": 13668, "text": "And what happens if you have a quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 13669, "text": "So, for instance, if it were this, this one's too disgusting.", "label": []}
{"id": 13670, "text": "I'm going to just do it with two of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 13671, "text": "So the parts with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13672, "text": "But now you have linear factors here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13673, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13674, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>-- maybe I'll call them <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13675, "text": "This is the way it works.", "label": []}
{"id": 13676, "text": "OK, I'm going to give you one more quick example of an integration technique just to liven things up.", "label": []}
{"id": 13677, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 13678, "text": "So here's a somewhat tricky example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13679, "text": "This is just a little trickier than I would give you on a test.", "label": []}
{"id": 13680, "text": "But it's the same principle, and I may do this on a final exam.", "label": []}
{"id": 13681, "text": "So suppose you're faced with this integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 13682, "text": "What are you going to do?", "label": []}
{"id": 13683, "text": "Integration by parts, great.", "label": []}
{"id": 13684, "text": "That's right, that's because this guy is begging to be differentiated, to be made simpler.", "label": []}
{"id": 13685, "text": "So that means that I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>, and I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13686, "text": "And I want to use integration by parts.", "label": []}
{"id": 13687, "text": "And then <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13688, "text": "So the answer is now, <EXPRESSION> minus the integral of this guy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13689, "text": "Which is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13690, "text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13691, "text": "Now, you are not done at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 13692, "text": "You're still in slightly hot water.", "label": []}
{"id": 13693, "text": "You're in tepid water, anyway.", "label": []}
{"id": 13694, "text": "So what is it that you have to do here?", "label": []}
{"id": 13695, "text": "You're faced with this integral, which I'll put on the next board.", "label": []}
{"id": 13696, "text": "It's a lot simpler than the other one, but as I say you're not quite out of the woods.", "label": []}
{"id": 13697, "text": "You're faced with the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13698, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13699, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Trig substitution actually, interestingly, will work.", "label": []}
{"id": 13700, "text": "But that wasn't what I wanted you to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 13701, "text": "I wanted you to, yeah, go ahead.", "label": []}
{"id": 13702, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Add and subtract <EXPRESSION> to the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 13703, "text": "So now, that's the correct answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 13704, "text": "This is the case where the numerator and the denominator are tied.", "label": []}
{"id": 13705, "text": "And so you have to use long division.", "label": []}
{"id": 13706, "text": "But a shortcut is just to observe that the result of long division is the same thing as doing this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13707, "text": "And then noticing that this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13708, "text": "So this is the same as long division, in this case.", "label": []}
{"id": 13709, "text": "Because when you divide in, it goes in with a quotient of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13710, "text": "And so this guy turns out to be <EXPRESSION> the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13711, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13712, "text": "So this is one extra step that you may be faced with someday in your life.", "label": []}
{"id": 13713, "text": "And just keep that in mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 13714, "text": "JERISON: We're starting a new unit today.", "label": []}
{"id": 13715, "text": "And, so this is Unit 2, and it's called Applications of Differentiation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13716, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13717, "text": "So, the first application, and we're going to do two today, is what are known as linear approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 13718, "text": "Whoops, that should have two p's in it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13719, "text": "Approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 13720, "text": "So, that can be summarized with one formula, but it's going to take us at least half an hour to explain how this formula is used.", "label": []}
{"id": 13721, "text": "So here's the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13722, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION> is approximately = to its value at a base point plus the derivative times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13723, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 13724, "text": "So this is the main formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 13725, "text": "For right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 13726, "text": "Put it in a box.", "label": []}
{"id": 13727, "text": "And let me just describe what it means, first.", "label": []}
{"id": 13728, "text": "And then I'll describe what it means again, and several other times.", "label": []}
{"id": 13729, "text": "So, first of all, what it means is that if you have a curve, which is <EQUATION>, it's approximately the same as its tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 13730, "text": "So this other side is the equation of the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 13731, "text": "So let's give an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13732, "text": "I'm going to take the function <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, and then its derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13733, "text": "And, so let's take the base point <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13734, "text": "That's pretty much the only place where we know the logarithm for sure.", "label": []}
{"id": 13735, "text": "And so, what we plug in here now, are the values.", "label": []}
{"id": 13736, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13737, "text": "Or, sorry, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13738, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>, well, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13739, "text": "So now we have an approximation formula which, if I copy down what's right up here, it's going to be <EXPRESSION> is approximately, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 13740, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13741, "text": "So I plugged in here, for <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> places.", "label": []}
{"id": 13742, "text": "I evaluated the coefficients and this is the dependent variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 13743, "text": "So, all told, if you like, what I have here is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13744, "text": "And let me draw a picture of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13745, "text": "So here's the graph of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13746, "text": "And then, I'll draw in the tangent line at the place that we're considering, which is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13747, "text": "So here's the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 13748, "text": "And I've separated a little bit, but really I probably should have drawn it a little closer there, to show you.", "label": []}
{"id": 13749, "text": "The whole point is that these two are nearby.", "label": []}
{"id": 13750, "text": "But they're not nearby everywhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 13751, "text": "So this is the line <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13752, "text": "Right, that's the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 13753, "text": "They're nearby only when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13754, "text": "So say in this little realm here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13755, "text": "So when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, this is true.", "label": []}
{"id": 13756, "text": "Once you get a little farther away, this straight line, this straight green line will separate from the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 13757, "text": "But near this place they're close together.", "label": []}
{"id": 13758, "text": "So the idea, again, is that the curve, the curved line, is approximately the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 13759, "text": "And this is one example of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13760, "text": "All right, so I want to explain this in one more way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13761, "text": "And then we want to discuss it systematically.", "label": []}
{"id": 13762, "text": "So the second way that I want to describe this requires me to remind you what the definition of the derivative is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13763, "text": "So, the definition of a derivative is that it's the limit, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>, that's one way of writing it, all right?", "label": []}
{"id": 13764, "text": "And this is the way we defined it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13765, "text": "And one of the things that we did in the first unit was we looked at this backwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 13766, "text": "We used the derivative knowing the derivatives of functions to evaluate some limits.", "label": []}
{"id": 13767, "text": "So you were supposed to do that on your.", "label": []}
{"id": 13768, "text": "In our test, there were some examples there, at least one example, where that was the easiest way to do the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 13769, "text": "So in other words, you can read this equation both ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 13770, "text": "This is really, of course, the same equation written twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 13771, "text": "Now, what's new about what we're going to do now is that we're going to take this expression here, <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to say well, when <EXPRESSION> is fairly near <EXPRESSION>, this expression is going to be fairly close to the limiting value.", "label": []}
{"id": 13772, "text": "So this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13773, "text": "So that, I claim, is the same as what's in the box in pink that I have over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13774, "text": "So this approximation formula here is the same as this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 13775, "text": "This is an average rate of change, and this is an infinitesimal rate of change.", "label": []}
{"id": 13776, "text": "And they're nearly the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13777, "text": "That's the claim.", "label": []}
{"id": 13778, "text": "So you'll have various exercises in which this approximation is the useful one to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 13779, "text": "And I will, as I said, I'll be illustrating this a little bit today.", "label": []}
{"id": 13780, "text": "Now, let me just explain why those two formulas in the boxes are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13781, "text": "So let's just start over here and explain that.", "label": []}
{"id": 13782, "text": "So the smaller box is the same thing if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13783, "text": "And now if I just write out what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to write it this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13784, "text": "Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13785, "text": "So here I'm using the notations <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13786, "text": "And so this is the change in <EXPRESSION>, this is just rewriting what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13787, "text": "And now the last step is just to put the constant on the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 13788, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13789, "text": "So this is exactly what I had just to begin with, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 13790, "text": "So these two are just algebraically the same statement.", "label": []}
{"id": 13791, "text": "That's one another way of looking at it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13792, "text": "All right, so now, I want to go through some systematic discussion here of several linear approximations, which you're going to be wanting to memorize.", "label": []}
{"id": 13793, "text": "And rather than it's being hard to memorize these, it's supposed to remind you.", "label": []}
{"id": 13794, "text": "So that you'll have a lot of extra reinforcement in remembering derivatives of all kinds.", "label": []}
{"id": 13795, "text": "So, when we carry out these systematic discussions, we want to make things absolutely as simple as possible.", "label": []}
{"id": 13796, "text": "And so one of the things that we do is we always use the base point to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13797, "text": "So I'm always going to have <EQUATION> in this standard list of formulas that I'm going to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 13798, "text": "And if I put <EQUATION>, then this formula becomes <EXPRESSION>, a little bit simpler to read.", "label": []}
{"id": 13799, "text": "It becomes <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13800, "text": "So this is probably the form that you'll want to remember most.", "label": []}
{"id": 13801, "text": "That's again, just the linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13802, "text": "But one always has to remember, and this is a very important thing, this one only worked near <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13803, "text": "This approximation here really only works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13804, "text": "So that's a little addition that you need to throw in.", "label": []}
{"id": 13805, "text": "So this one works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13806, "text": "You can't expect it to be true far away.", "label": []}
{"id": 13807, "text": "The curve can go anywhere it wants, when it's far away from the point of tangency.", "label": []}
{"id": 13808, "text": "So, OK, so let's work this out.", "label": []}
{"id": 13809, "text": "Let's do it for the sine function, for the cosine function, and for <EXPRESSION>, to begin with.", "label": []}
{"id": 13810, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13811, "text": "Question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13812, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 13813, "text": "JERISON: Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13814, "text": "When does this one work.", "label": []}
{"id": 13815, "text": "Well, so the question was, when does this one work.", "label": []}
{"id": 13816, "text": "Again, this is when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13817, "text": "Because it's actually the same as this one over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13818, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13819, "text": "And indeed, that's what's going on when we take this limiting value.", "label": []}
{"id": 13820, "text": "<EXPRESSION> going to <EXPRESSION> is the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13821, "text": "<EXPRESSION> small.", "label": []}
{"id": 13822, "text": "So another way of saying it is, the <EXPRESSION> is small.", "label": []}
{"id": 13823, "text": "Now, exactly what we mean by small will also be explained.", "label": []}
{"id": 13824, "text": "But it is a matter to some extent of intuition as to how much, how good it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13825, "text": "In practical cases, people will really care about how small it is before the approximation is useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 13826, "text": "And that's a serious issue.", "label": []}
{"id": 13827, "text": "All right, so let me carry out these approximations for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13828, "text": "Again, this is always for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13829, "text": "So all of these are going to be for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13830, "text": "So in order to make this computation, I have to evaluate the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 13831, "text": "I need to plug in two numbers here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13832, "text": "In order to get this expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 13833, "text": "I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is and I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13834, "text": "If this is the function <EXPRESSION>, then I'm going to make a little table over to the right here with <EXPRESSION> and then I'm going to evaluate <EXPRESSION>, and then I'm going to evaluate <EXPRESSION>, and then read off what the answers are.", "label": []}
{"id": 13835, "text": "Right, so first of all if the function is <EXPRESSION>, the derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13836, "text": "The value of <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13837, "text": "The derivative is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13838, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13839, "text": "So there we go.", "label": []}
{"id": 13840, "text": "So now we have the coefficients <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13841, "text": "So this number is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13842, "text": "And this number is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13843, "text": "So what we get here is <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13844, "text": "There's the linear approximation to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13845, "text": "Similarly, so now this is a routine matter to just read this off for this table.", "label": []}
{"id": 13846, "text": "We'll do it for the cosine function.", "label": []}
{"id": 13847, "text": "If you differentiate the cosine, what you get is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13848, "text": "The value at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13849, "text": "The value of this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13850, "text": "So this is going back over here, <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13851, "text": "This linear function happens to be constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13852, "text": "And finally, if I do need <EXPRESSION>, its derivative is again <EXPRESSION>, and its value at <EXPRESSION> is ,<EXPRESSION> the value of the derivative at <EXPRESSION> is also <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13853, "text": "So both of the terms here, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they're both <EXPRESSION> and we get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13854, "text": "So these are the linear approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 13855, "text": "You can memorize these.", "label": []}
{"id": 13856, "text": "You'll probably remember them either this way or that way.", "label": []}
{"id": 13857, "text": "This collection of information here encodes the same collection of information as we have over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13858, "text": "For the values of the function and the values of their derivatives at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13859, "text": "So let me just emphasize again the geometric point of view by drawing pictures of these results.", "label": []}
{"id": 13860, "text": "So first of all, for the sine function, here's the sine - well, close enough.", "label": []}
{"id": 13861, "text": "So that's - boy, now that is quite some sine, isn't it?", "label": []}
{"id": 13862, "text": "I should try to make the two bumps be the same height, roughly speaking.", "label": []}
{"id": 13863, "text": "Anyway the tangent line we're talking about is here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13864, "text": "And this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13865, "text": "And this is the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13866, "text": "And near <EXPRESSION>, those things coincide pretty closely.", "label": []}
{"id": 13867, "text": "The cosine function, I'll put that underneath, I guess.", "label": []}
{"id": 13868, "text": "I think I can fit it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13869, "text": "Make it a little smaller here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13870, "text": "So for the cosine function, we're up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13871, "text": "It's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13872, "text": "Well, no wonder the tangent line is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13873, "text": "It's horizontal.", "label": []}
{"id": 13874, "text": "The tangent line is horizontal, so the function corresponding is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 13875, "text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13876, "text": "And finally, if I draw <EQUATION>, that's coming down like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13877, "text": "And the tangent line is here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13878, "text": "And it's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13879, "text": "The value is <EXPRESSION> and the slope is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13880, "text": "So this is how to remember it graphically if you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 13881, "text": "This analytic picture is extremely important and will help you to deal with sines, cosines and exponentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 13882, "text": "Yes, question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13883, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 13884, "text": "JERISON: The question is what do you normally use linear approximations for.", "label": []}
{"id": 13885, "text": "Good question.", "label": []}
{"id": 13886, "text": "We're getting there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13887, "text": "First, we're getting a little library of them and I'll give you a few examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 13888, "text": "OK, so now, I need to finish the catalog with two more examples which are just a little bit, slightly more challenging.", "label": []}
{"id": 13889, "text": "And a little bit less obvious.", "label": []}
{"id": 13890, "text": "So, the next couple that we're going to do are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13891, "text": "OK, these are the last two that we're going to write down.", "label": []}
{"id": 13892, "text": "And that you need to think about.", "label": []}
{"id": 13893, "text": "Now, the procedure is the same as over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13894, "text": "Namely, I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13895, "text": "And then I'll have the coefficients to be able to fill in what the approximation is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13896, "text": "So <EQUATION>, in the case of the logarithm.", "label": []}
{"id": 13897, "text": "And <EXPRESSION>, if I plug in, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13898, "text": "And f' if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13899, "text": "And similarly if I do it for this one, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13900, "text": "And when I plug in <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13901, "text": "And here I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13902, "text": "So the corresponding statement here is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13903, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13904, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION> and here we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13905, "text": "And now, I do want to make a connection, explain to you what's going on here and the connection with the first example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13906, "text": "We already did the logarithm once.", "label": []}
{"id": 13907, "text": "And let's just point out that these two computations are the same, or practically the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 13908, "text": "Here I use the base point <EXPRESSION>, but because of my, sort of, convenient form, which will end up, I claim, being much more convenient for pretty much every purpose, we want to do these things near <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13909, "text": "You cannot expand the logarithm and understand a tangent line for it at <EQUATION>, because it goes down to minus infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 13910, "text": "Similarly, if you try to graph <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> without the <EXPRESSION> here, you'll discover that sometimes the slope is infinite, and so forth.", "label": []}
{"id": 13911, "text": "So this is a bad choice of point.", "label": []}
{"id": 13912, "text": "1 is a much better choice of a place to expand around.", "label": []}
{"id": 13913, "text": "And then we shift things so that it looks like it's <EQUATION>, by shifting by the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13914, "text": "So the connection with the previous example is that the-- what we wrote before I could write as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13915, "text": "Right, that's just recopying what I have over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13916, "text": "Except with the letter <EXPRESSION> rather than the letter <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13917, "text": "And then I plug in, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13918, "text": "And then that, if I copy it down, you see that I have a <EXPRESSION> in place of <EXPRESSION>, that's the same as this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13919, "text": "And if I write out <EXPRESSION>, if I subtract <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>, that means that it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13920, "text": "So that's what's on the right-hand side there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13921, "text": "So these are the same computation, I've just changed the variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 13922, "text": "So now I want to try to address the question that was asked about how this is used.", "label": []}
{"id": 13923, "text": "And what the importance is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13924, "text": "And what I'm going to do is just give you one example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13925, "text": "And then try to emphasize.", "label": []}
{"id": 13926, "text": "The first way in which this is a useful idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 13927, "text": "So, or maybe this is the second example.", "label": []}
{"id": 13928, "text": "If you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 13929, "text": "So we'll call this Example 2, maybe.", "label": []}
{"id": 13930, "text": "So let's just take the logarithm of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13931, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13932, "text": "Just a second.", "label": []}
{"id": 13933, "text": "Let's take the logarithm of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13934, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13935, "text": "So I claim that, according to our rules, I can glance at this and I can immediately see that it's approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13936, "text": "So what did I use here?", "label": []}
{"id": 13937, "text": "I used that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and the value of <EXPRESSION> that I used was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13938, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 13939, "text": "So that is the formula, so I should put a box around these two formulas too.", "label": []}
{"id": 13940, "text": "That's this formula here, applied with <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13941, "text": "And I'm claiming that <EXPRESSION> is a sufficiently small number, sufficiently close to <EXPRESSION>, that this is an OK statement.", "label": []}
{"id": 13942, "text": "So the first question that I want to ask you is, which do you think is a more complicated thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13943, "text": "The left-hand side or the right-hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 13944, "text": "I claim that this is a more complicated thing, you'd have to go to a calculator to punch out and figure out what this thing is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13945, "text": "This is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13946, "text": "You know what a tenth is.", "label": []}
{"id": 13947, "text": "So the distinction that I want to make is that this half, this part, this is hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 13948, "text": "And this is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13949, "text": "Now, that may look contradictory, but I want to just do it right above as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 13950, "text": "This is hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 13951, "text": "And this is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 13952, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13953, "text": "This looks uglier, but actually this is the hard one.", "label": []}
{"id": 13954, "text": "And this is giving us information about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13955, "text": "Now, let me show you why that's true.", "label": []}
{"id": 13956, "text": "Look down this column here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13957, "text": "These are the hard ones, hard functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13958, "text": "These are the easy functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13959, "text": "What's easier than this?", "label": []}
{"id": 13960, "text": "Nothing.", "label": []}
{"id": 13961, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13962, "text": "Well, yeah, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13963, "text": "That's easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 13964, "text": "Over here it gets even worse.", "label": []}
{"id": 13965, "text": "These are the hard functions and these are the easy ones.", "label": []}
{"id": 13966, "text": "So that's the main advantage of linear approximation is you get something much simpler to deal with.", "label": []}
{"id": 13967, "text": "And if you've made a valid approximation you can make much progress on problems.", "label": []}
{"id": 13968, "text": "OK, we'll be doing some more examples, but I saw some more questions before I made that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 13969, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 13970, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 13971, "text": "JERISON: Is this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13972, "text": "<EXPRESSION> or what?", "label": []}
{"id": 13973, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 13974, "text": "JERISON: This is a parens there.", "label": []}
{"id": 13975, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 13978, "text": "I don't know.", "label": []}
{"id": 13979, "text": "Other questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 13980, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 13981, "text": "JERISON: OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13982, "text": "So let's continue here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13983, "text": "Let me give you some more examples, where it becomes even more vivid if you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 13984, "text": "That this approximation is giving us something a little simpler to deal with.", "label": []}
{"id": 13985, "text": "So here's Example 3.", "label": []}
{"id": 13986, "text": "I want to, I'll find the linear approximation near <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13987, "text": "I also - when I write this expression near <EQUATION>, that's the same thing as this.", "label": []}
{"id": 13988, "text": "That's the same thing as saying <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> - of the function <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13989, "text": "So here's a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 13990, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 13991, "text": "Now, what I claim I want to use for the purposes of this approximation, are just the sum of the approximation formulas that we've already derived.", "label": []}
{"id": 13992, "text": "And just to combine them algebraically.", "label": []}
{"id": 13993, "text": "So I'm not going to do any calculus, I'm just going to remember.", "label": []}
{"id": 13994, "text": "So with <EXPRESSION>, it's pretty clear that I should be using this formula for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 13995, "text": "For the other one, it may be slightly less obvious but we have powers of <EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 13996, "text": "So let's plug those in.", "label": []}
{"id": 13997, "text": "I'll put this up so that you can remember it.", "label": []}
{"id": 13998, "text": "And we're going to carry out this approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 13999, "text": "So, first of all, I'm going to write this so that it's slightly more suggestive.", "label": []}
{"id": 14000, "text": "Namely, I'm going to write it as a product.", "label": []}
{"id": 14001, "text": "And there you can now see the exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 14002, "text": "In this case, <EQUATION>, eh <EXPRESSION>, that we're going to use.", "label": []}
{"id": 14003, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 14004, "text": "So now I have <EXPRESSION>, and that's going to be approximately-- well I'm going to use this formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14005, "text": "I have to use it correctly.", "label": []}
{"id": 14006, "text": "x is replaced by <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14007, "text": "And then over here, I can just copy verbatim the other approximation formula with <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14008, "text": "So this is times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14009, "text": "And now I'm going to carry out the multiplication.", "label": []}
{"id": 14010, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14011, "text": "So now, here's our formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14012, "text": "So now this isn't where things stop.", "label": []}
{"id": 14013, "text": "And indeed, in this kind of arithmetic that I'm describing now, things are easier than they are in ordinary algebra, in arithmetic.", "label": []}
{"id": 14014, "text": "The reason is that there's another step, which I'm now going to perform.", "label": []}
{"id": 14015, "text": "Which is that I'm going to throw away this term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14016, "text": "I'm going to ignore it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14017, "text": "In fact, I didn't even have to work it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14018, "text": "Because I'm going to throw it away.", "label": []}
{"id": 14019, "text": "So the reason is that already, when I passed from this expression to this one, that is from this type of thing to this thing, I was already throwing away quadratic and higher-ordered terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 14020, "text": "So this isn't the only quadratic term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14021, "text": "There are tons of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 14022, "text": "I have to ignore all of them if I'm going to ignore some of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 14023, "text": "And in fact, I only want to be left with the linear stuff.", "label": []}
{"id": 14024, "text": "Because that's all I'm really getting a valid computation for.", "label": []}
{"id": 14025, "text": "So, this is approximately <EXPRESSION> minus, so let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 14026, "text": "It's a total of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14027, "text": "And this is the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14028, "text": "This is the linear part.", "label": []}
{"id": 14029, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> term is negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 14030, "text": "So we drop <EXPRESSION> term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14031, "text": "Terms, and higher.", "label": []}
{"id": 14032, "text": "All of those terms should be lower-order.", "label": []}
{"id": 14033, "text": "If you imagine <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or maybe <EXPRESSION>, then these terms will end up being much smaller.", "label": []}
{"id": 14034, "text": "So we have a rather crude approach.", "label": []}
{"id": 14035, "text": "And that's really the simplicity, and that's the savings.", "label": []}
{"id": 14036, "text": "So now, since this unit is called Applications, and these are indeed applications to math, I also wanted to give you a real-life application.", "label": []}
{"id": 14037, "text": "Or a place where linear approximations come up in real life.", "label": []}
{"id": 14038, "text": "So maybe we'll call this Example 4.", "label": []}
{"id": 14039, "text": "This is supposedly a real-life example.", "label": []}
{"id": 14040, "text": "I'll try to persuade you that it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14041, "text": "So I like this example because it's got a lot of math, as well as physics in it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14042, "text": "So here I am, on the surface of the earth.", "label": []}
{"id": 14043, "text": "And here is a satellite going this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 14044, "text": "At some velocity, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14045, "text": "And this satellite has a clock on it because this is a GPS satellite.", "label": []}
{"id": 14046, "text": "And it has a time, <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 14047, "text": "But I have a watch, in fact it's right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14048, "text": "And I have a time which I keep.", "label": []}
{"id": 14049, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>, And there's an interesting relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is called time dilation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14050, "text": "And this is from special relativity.", "label": []}
{"id": 14051, "text": "And it's the following formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14052, "text": "<EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> is the velocity of the satellite, and <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light.", "label": []}
{"id": 14053, "text": "So now I'd like to get a rough idea of how different my watch is from the clock on the satellite.", "label": []}
{"id": 14054, "text": "So I'm going to use this same approximation, we've already used it once.", "label": []}
{"id": 14055, "text": "I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14056, "text": "But now let me just remind you.", "label": []}
{"id": 14057, "text": "The situation here is, we have something of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14058, "text": "That's what's happening when I multiply through here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14059, "text": "So with <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14060, "text": "So in real life, of course, the expression that you're going to use the linear approximation on isn't necessarily itself linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 14061, "text": "It can be any physical quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 14062, "text": "So in this case it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14063, "text": "And now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately =, well again it's the same rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 14064, "text": "There's an <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14065, "text": "So this is approximately, by the same rule, this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> Now, I promised you that this would be a real-life problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 14066, "text": "So the question is when people were designing these GPS systems, they run clocks in the satellites.", "label": []}
{"id": 14067, "text": "You're down there, you're making your measurements, you're talking to the satellite by-- or you're receiving its signals from its radio.", "label": []}
{"id": 14068, "text": "The question is, is this going to cause problems in the transmission.", "label": []}
{"id": 14069, "text": "And there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for.", "label": []}
{"id": 14070, "text": "So in this case, what actually happened is that <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.", "label": []}
{"id": 14071, "text": "That's how fast the GPS satellites actually go.", "label": []}
{"id": 14072, "text": "In fact, they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they could've tweaked this if they had put them at different places.", "label": []}
{"id": 14073, "text": "Anyway, the speed of light is <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.", "label": []}
{"id": 14074, "text": "So this number, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14075, "text": "Now, if you actually keep track of how much of an error that would make in a GPS location, what you would find is maybe it's a millimeter or something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14076, "text": "So in fact it doesn't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 14077, "text": "So that's nice.", "label": []}
{"id": 14078, "text": "But in fact the engineers who were designing these systems actually did use this very computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14079, "text": "Exactly this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14080, "text": "And the way that they used it was, they decided that because the clocks were different, when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency, that frequency would be shifted.", "label": []}
{"id": 14081, "text": "Would be offset.", "label": []}
{"id": 14082, "text": "And they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of, exactly this, offset.", "label": []}
{"id": 14083, "text": "To compensate for the way the signal is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14084, "text": "So from the point of view of good reception on your little GPS device, they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites, according to exactly this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 14085, "text": "And incidentally, the reason why they didn't-- they ignored higher-order terms, the sort of quadratic terms, is that if you take <EXPRESSION> that's a size <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14086, "text": "And that really is totally negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 14087, "text": "That doesn't matter to any measurement at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 14088, "text": "That's on the order of nanometers, and it's not important for any of the uses to which GPS is put.", "label": []}
{"id": 14089, "text": "OK, so that's a real example of a use of linear approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14090, "text": "So.", "label": []}
{"id": 14091, "text": "let's take a little pause here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14092, "text": "I'm going to switch gears and talk about quadratic approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 14093, "text": "But before I do that, let's have some more questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14094, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 14095, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 14096, "text": "JERISON: OK, so the question was asked, suppose I did this by different method.", "label": []}
{"id": 14097, "text": "Suppose I applied the original formula here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14098, "text": "Namely, I define the function <EXPRESSION>, which was this function here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14099, "text": "And then I plugged in its value at <EQUATION> and the value of its derivative at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14100, "text": "So the answer is, yes, it's also true that if I call this function <EXPRESSION>, then it must be true that the linear approximation is <EXPRESSION> of - I'm sorry, it's at <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14101, "text": "So that should be true.", "label": []}
{"id": 14102, "text": "That's the formula that we're using.", "label": []}
{"id": 14103, "text": "It's up there in the pink also.", "label": []}
{"id": 14104, "text": "So this is the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14105, "text": "So now, what about <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 14106, "text": "Well, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14107, "text": "So this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14108, "text": "So that's no surprise.", "label": []}
{"id": 14109, "text": "And that's what I got.", "label": []}
{"id": 14110, "text": "If I computed <EXPRESSION>, by the product rule it would be an annoying, somewhat long, computation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14111, "text": "And because of what we just done, we know what it has to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 14112, "text": "It has to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14113, "text": "Because this is a shortcut for doing it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14114, "text": "This is faster than doing that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14115, "text": "But of course, that's a legal way of doing it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14116, "text": "When you get to second derivatives, you'll quickly discover that this method that I've just described is complicated, but far superior to differentiating this expression twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 14117, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROF.", "label": []}
{"id": 14118, "text": "JERISON: Would you have to throw away an <EXPRESSION> term if you differentiated?", "label": []}
{"id": 14119, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 14120, "text": "And in fact, we didn't really have to do that here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14121, "text": "If you differentiate and then plug in <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14122, "text": "So if you differentiate this and you plug in <EQUATION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14123, "text": "You differentiate this and you plug in <EQUATION>, this term still drops out because it's just a <EXPRESSION> when you differentiate.", "label": []}
{"id": 14124, "text": "And then you plug in <EQUATION>, it's gone too.", "label": []}
{"id": 14125, "text": "And similarly, if you're up here, it goes away and similarly over here it goes away.", "label": []}
{"id": 14126, "text": "So the higher-order terms never influence this computation here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14127, "text": "This just captures the linear features of the function.", "label": []}
{"id": 14128, "text": "So now I want to go on to quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14129, "text": "And now we're going to elaborate on this formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14130, "text": "So, linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14131, "text": "Well, that should have been linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14132, "text": "Liner.", "label": []}
{"id": 14133, "text": "That's interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 14134, "text": "OK, so that was wrong.", "label": []}
{"id": 14135, "text": "But now we're going to change it to quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 14136, "text": "So, suppose we talk about a quadratic approximation here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14137, "text": "Now, the quadratic approximation is going to be just an elaboration, one more step of detail.", "label": []}
{"id": 14138, "text": "From the linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 14139, "text": "In other words, it's an extension of the linear approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14140, "text": "And so we're adding one more term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14141, "text": "And the extra term turns out to be related to the second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 14142, "text": "But there's a factor of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14143, "text": "So this is the formula for the quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14144, "text": "And this chunk of it, of course, is the linear part.", "label": []}
{"id": 14145, "text": "This time I'll spell 'linear' correctly.", "label": []}
{"id": 14146, "text": "So the linear part is the first piece.", "label": []}
{"id": 14147, "text": "And the quadratic part is the second piece.", "label": []}
{"id": 14148, "text": "I want to develop this same catalog of functions as I had before.", "label": []}
{"id": 14149, "text": "In other words, I want to extend our formulas to the higher-order terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 14150, "text": "And if you do that for this example here, maybe I'll even illustrate with this example before I go on, if you do it with this example here, just to give you a flavor for what goes on, what turns out to be the case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14151, "text": "So this is the linear version.", "label": []}
{"id": 14152, "text": "And now I'm going to compare it to the quadratic version.", "label": []}
{"id": 14153, "text": "So the quadratic version turns out to be this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14154, "text": "That's what turns out to be the quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14155, "text": "And when I use this example here, so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14156, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is the same as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14157, "text": "So that's approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14158, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14159, "text": "So that turns out, instead of being <EXPRESSION>, that's point, what is it, .", "label": []}
{"id": 14160, "text": "<EXPRESSION> or something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14161, "text": "It's a little bit less.", "label": []}
{"id": 14162, "text": "It's not.", "label": []}
{"id": 14163, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, but it's pretty close.", "label": []}
{"id": 14164, "text": "So if you like, the correction is lower in the decimal expansion.", "label": []}
{"id": 14165, "text": "Now let me actually check a few of these.", "label": []}
{"id": 14166, "text": "I'll carry them out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14167, "text": "And what I'm going to probably save for next time is explaining to you, so this is why this factor of <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to do this later.", "label": []}
{"id": 14168, "text": "Do this next time.", "label": []}
{"id": 14169, "text": "You can certainly do well to stick with this presentation for one more lecture.", "label": []}
{"id": 14170, "text": "So we can see this reinforced.", "label": []}
{"id": 14171, "text": "So now I'm going to work out these derivatives of the higher-order terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 14172, "text": "And let me do it for the <EXPRESSION> approximately <EXPRESSION> case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14173, "text": "So first of all, I want to add in the extra term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14174, "text": "Here's the extra term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14175, "text": "For the quadratic part.", "label": []}
{"id": 14176, "text": "And now in order to figure out what's going on, I'm going to need to compute, also, second derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 14177, "text": "So here I need a second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 14178, "text": "And I need to throw in the value of that second derivative at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14179, "text": "So this is what I'm going to need to compute.", "label": []}
{"id": 14180, "text": "So if I do it, for example, for the sine function, I already have the linear part.", "label": []}
{"id": 14181, "text": "I need this last bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 14182, "text": "So I differentiate the sine function twice and I get, I claim minus the sine function.", "label": []}
{"id": 14183, "text": "The first derivative is the cosine and the cosine derivative is minus the sine.", "label": []}
{"id": 14184, "text": "And when I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, I get, lo and behold, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14185, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14186, "text": "So actually the quadratic approximation is the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 14187, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14188, "text": "There's no <EXPRESSION> term here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14189, "text": "So that's why this is such a terrific approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14190, "text": "It's also the quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 14191, "text": "For the cosine function, if you differentiate twice, you get the derivative is minus the sign and derivative of that is minus the cosine.", "label": []}
{"id": 14192, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14193, "text": "And now, if I evaluate that at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14194, "text": "And so the term that I have to plug in here, this <EXPRESSION> is the coefficient that appears right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14195, "text": "So I need a <EXPRESSION> extra.", "label": []}
{"id": 14196, "text": "And if you do it for the <EXPRESSION>, you get an <EXPRESSION>, and you got a <EXPRESSION> and so you get <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14197, "text": "I'm going to finish these two in just a second, but I first want to tell you about the geometric significance of this quadratic term.", "label": []}
{"id": 14198, "text": "So here we go.", "label": []}
{"id": 14199, "text": "Geometric significance (of the quadratic term).", "label": []}
{"id": 14200, "text": "So the geometric significance is best to describe just by drawing a picture here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14201, "text": "And I'm going to draw the picture of the cosine function.", "label": []}
{"id": 14202, "text": "And remember we already had the tangent line.", "label": []}
{"id": 14203, "text": "So the tangent line was this horizontal here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14204, "text": "And that was <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14205, "text": "But you can see intuitively, that doesn't even tell you whether this function is above or below <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14206, "text": "Doesn't tell you much.", "label": []}
{"id": 14207, "text": "It's sort of begging for there to be a little more information to tell us what the function is doing nearby.", "label": []}
{"id": 14208, "text": "And indeed, that's what this second expression does for us.", "label": []}
{"id": 14209, "text": "It's some kind of parabola underneath here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14210, "text": "So this is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14211, "text": "Which is a much better fit to the curve than the horizontal line.", "label": []}
{"id": 14212, "text": "And this is, if you like, this is the best fit parabola.", "label": []}
{"id": 14213, "text": "So it's going to be the closest parabola to the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 14214, "text": "And that's more or less the significance.", "label": []}
{"id": 14215, "text": "It's much, much closer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14216, "text": "All right, I want to give you, well, I think we'll save these other derivations for next time because I think we're out of time now.", "label": []}
{"id": 14217, "text": "So we'll do these next time.", "label": []}
{"id": 14709, "text": "PROFESSOR: Well, because our subject today is trig integrals and substitutions, Professor Jerison called in his substitute teacher for today.", "label": []}
{"id": 14710, "text": "That's me.", "label": []}
{"id": 14711, "text": "Professor Miller.", "label": []}
{"id": 14712, "text": "And I'm going to try to tell you about trig substitutions and trig integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 14713, "text": "And I'll be here tomorrow to do more of the same, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 14714, "text": "So, this is about trigonometry, and maybe first thing I'll do is remind you of some basic things about trigonometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 14715, "text": "So, if I have a circle, trigonometry is all based on the circle of radius 1 and centered at the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 14716, "text": "And so if this is an angle of <EXPRESSION>, up from the x-axis, then the coordinates of this point are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14717, "text": "And so that leads right away to some trig identities, which you know very well.", "label": []}
{"id": 14718, "text": "But I'm going to put them up here because we'll use them over and over again today.", "label": []}
{"id": 14719, "text": "Remember the convention <EXPRESSION> secretly means <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14720, "text": "It would be more sensible to write a parenthesis around the <EXPRESSION> and then say you square that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14721, "text": "But everybody in the world puts the <EXPRESSION> up there over the <EXPRESSION>, and so I'll do that too.", "label": []}
{"id": 14722, "text": "So that follows just because the circle has radius <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14723, "text": "But then there are some other identities too, which I think you remember.", "label": []}
{"id": 14724, "text": "I'll write them down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14725, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, there's this double angle formula that says <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14726, "text": "And there's also the double angle formula for the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14727, "text": "Remember what that says?", "label": []}
{"id": 14728, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14729, "text": "I'm going to use these trig identities and I'm going to use them in a slightly different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 14730, "text": "And so I'd like to pay a little more attention to this one and get a different way of writing this one out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14731, "text": "So this is actually the half angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14732, "text": "And that says, I'm going to try to express the <EXPRESSION> in terms of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14733, "text": "So if I know the <EXPRESSION>, I want to try to express the <EXPRESSION> in terms of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14734, "text": "Well, I'll start with a <EXPRESSION> and play with that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14735, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 14736, "text": "Well, we know what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14737, "text": "But we also know what the <EXPRESSION> is in terms of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14738, "text": "So I can eliminate the <EXPRESSION> from this picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 14739, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14740, "text": "I put in what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION> And so that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14741, "text": "There's this <EXPRESSION>, which gets a plus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 14742, "text": "Because of these two minus signs.", "label": []}
{"id": 14743, "text": "And there's the one that was there before, so altogether there are two of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 14744, "text": "I want to isolate what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14745, "text": "Or rather, what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14746, "text": "So let's solve for that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14747, "text": "So I'll put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14748, "text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14749, "text": "And then, I want to divide by this <EXPRESSION>, and so that puts a <EXPRESSION> in this denominator here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14750, "text": "So some people call that the half angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14751, "text": "What it really is for us is it's a way of eliminating powers from <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14752, "text": "I've gotten rid of this square at the expense of putting in a <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14753, "text": "We'll use that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14754, "text": "And, similarly, same calculation shows that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14755, "text": "Same <EXPRESSION>, in that formula also, but it has a minus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 14756, "text": "For the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14757, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 14758, "text": "so that's my little review of trig identities that we'll make use of as this lecture goes on.", "label": []}
{"id": 14759, "text": "I want to talk about trig identity-- trig integrals, and you know some trig integrals, I'm sure, already.", "label": []}
{"id": 14760, "text": "Like, well, let me write the differential form first.", "label": []}
{"id": 14761, "text": "You know that <EXPRESSION>, or maybe I'll say <EXPRESSION>, is, let's see, that's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, right.", "label": []}
{"id": 14762, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14763, "text": "And so if I integrate both sides here, the integral form of this is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14764, "text": "Is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14765, "text": "And in the same way, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14766, "text": "Right, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14767, "text": "And when I integrate that, I find the integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14768, "text": "So that's our starting point.", "label": []}
{"id": 14769, "text": "And the game today, for the first half of the lecture, is to use that basic-- just those basic integration formulas, together with clever use of trig identities in order to compute more complicated formulas involving trig functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14770, "text": "So the first thing, the first topic, is to think about integrals of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14771, "text": "Where here I have in mind <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are non-negative integers.", "label": []}
{"id": 14772, "text": "So let's try to integrate these.", "label": []}
{"id": 14773, "text": "I'll show you some applications of these pretty soon.", "label": []}
{"id": 14774, "text": "Looking down the road a little bit, integrals like this show up in Fourier series and many other subjects in mathematics.", "label": []}
{"id": 14775, "text": "It turns out they're quite important to be able to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 14776, "text": "So that's why we're doing them now.", "label": []}
{"id": 14777, "text": "Well, so there are two cases to think about here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14778, "text": "When you're integrating things like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14779, "text": "There's the easy case, and let's do that one first.", "label": []}
{"id": 14780, "text": "The easy case is when at least one exponent is odd.", "label": []}
{"id": 14781, "text": "That's the easy case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14782, "text": "So, for example, suppose that I wanted to integrate, well, let's take the case <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14783, "text": "So I'm integrating <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14784, "text": "I'm taking-- Oh, I could do that one.", "label": []}
{"id": 14785, "text": "Let's see if that's what I want to take.", "label": []}
{"id": 14786, "text": "Yeah.", "label": []}
{"id": 14787, "text": "My confusion is that I meant to have this a different power.", "label": []}
{"id": 14788, "text": "You were thinking that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14789, "text": "So let's do this case when <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14790, "text": "So the integral I'm trying to do is any power of the <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14791, "text": "Well, here's the trick.", "label": []}
{"id": 14792, "text": "Recognize, use this formula up at the top there to see <EXPRESSION> as something that we already have on the blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 14793, "text": "So, the way to exploit that is to make a substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14794, "text": "And substitution is going to be <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14795, "text": "And here's why.", "label": []}
{"id": 14796, "text": "Then this integral that I'm trying to do is the integral of <EXPRESSION>, that's already a simplification.", "label": []}
{"id": 14797, "text": "And then there's that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14798, "text": "When you make a substitution, you've got to go all the way and replace everything in the expression by things involving this new variable that I've introduced.", "label": []}
{"id": 14799, "text": "So I'd better get rid of the <EXPRESSION> and rewrite it in terms of <EXPRESSION> or in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14800, "text": "And I can do that because <EXPRESSION>, according to that formula, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14801, "text": "Let me put a box around that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14802, "text": "That's our substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14803, "text": "When you make a substitution, you also want to compute the differential of the variable that you substitute in.", "label": []}
{"id": 14804, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> that appears here is just, exactly, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14805, "text": "And I've replaced this trig integral with something that doesn't involve trig functions at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 14806, "text": "This is a lot easier.", "label": []}
{"id": 14807, "text": "We can just plug into what we know here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14808, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant, and I've done the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 14809, "text": "But I'm not quite done with the problem yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 14810, "text": "Because to be nice to your reader and to yourself, you should go back at this point, probably, go back and get rid of this new variable that you introduced.", "label": []}
{"id": 14811, "text": "You're the one who introduced this variable, you.", "label": []}
{"id": 14812, "text": "Nobody except you, really, knows what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 14813, "text": "But the rest of the world knows what they asked for the first place that involved <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14814, "text": "So I have to go back and get rid of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14815, "text": "And that's not hard to do in this case, because <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14816, "text": "And so I make this back substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14817, "text": "And that's what you get.", "label": []}
{"id": 14818, "text": "So there's the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14819, "text": "OK, so the game was, I use this odd power of the <EXPRESSION> here, and I could see it appearing as the differential of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14820, "text": "So that's what made this substitution work.", "label": []}
{"id": 14821, "text": "Let's do another example to see how that works out in a slightly different case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14822, "text": "So here's another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 14823, "text": "Now I do have an odd power.", "label": []}
{"id": 14824, "text": "One of the exponents is odd, so I'm in the easy case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14825, "text": "But it's not <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14826, "text": "The game now is to use this trig identity to get rid of the largest even power that you can, from this odd power here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14827, "text": "So use <EQUATION>, to eliminate a lot of powers from that odd power.", "label": []}
{"id": 14828, "text": "Watch what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 14829, "text": "So this is not really a substitution or anything, this is just a trig identity.", "label": []}
{"id": 14830, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14831, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14832, "text": "And then I have the remaining <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14833, "text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14834, "text": "So let me rewrite that a little bit to see how this works out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14835, "text": "This is the integral of <EXPRESSION> minus, and then there's the product of these two.", "label": []}
{"id": 14836, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14837, "text": "So now I'm really exactly in the situation that I was in over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14838, "text": "I've got a single power of a <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14839, "text": "It happens that it's a sine here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14840, "text": "But that's not going to cause any trouble, we can go ahead and play the same game that I did there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14841, "text": "So, so far I've just been using trig identities.", "label": []}
{"id": 14842, "text": "But now I'll use a trig substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14843, "text": "And I think I want to write these as powers of a variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 14844, "text": "And then this is going to be the differential of that variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 14845, "text": "So I'll take <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>, and that means that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14846, "text": "There's the substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14847, "text": "So when I make that substitution, what do we get.", "label": []}
{"id": 14848, "text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14849, "text": "<EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> becomes not quite <EXPRESSION>, watch for the signum, watch for this minus sign here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14850, "text": "It becomes <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14851, "text": "But that's OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 14852, "text": "The minus sign comes outside.", "label": []}
{"id": 14853, "text": "And I can integrate both of these powers, so I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14854, "text": "And then this 4th power gives me a 5th power, when I integrate.", "label": []}
{"id": 14855, "text": "And don't forget the constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14856, "text": "Am I done?", "label": []}
{"id": 14857, "text": "Not quite done.", "label": []}
{"id": 14858, "text": "I have to back substitute and get rid of my choice of variable, <EXPRESSION>, and replace it with yours.", "label": []}
{"id": 14859, "text": "Questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 14860, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: There should indeed.", "label": []}
{"id": 14861, "text": "I forgot this minus sign when I came down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14862, "text": "So these two gang up to give me a plus.", "label": []}
{"id": 14863, "text": "Was that what the other question was about, too?", "label": []}
{"id": 14864, "text": "Thanks.", "label": []}
{"id": 14865, "text": "So let's back substitute.", "label": []}
{"id": 14866, "text": "And I'm going to put that over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14867, "text": "And the result is, well, I just replace the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14868, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus, thank you, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14869, "text": "And there's the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14870, "text": "By the way, you can remember one of the nice things about doing an integral is it's fairly easy to check your answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14871, "text": "You can always differentiate the thing you get, and see whether you get the right thing when you go back.", "label": []}

{"id": 14875, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14876, "text": "No <EXPRESSION> in sight.", "label": []}
{"id": 14877, "text": "But I do have an odd power of a trig function, of a <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14878, "text": "So I'm in the easy case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14879, "text": "And the procedure that I was suggesting says I want to take out the largest even power that I can, from the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14880, "text": "So I'll take that out, that's a <EXPRESSION>, and write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14881, "text": "Well, now I'm very happy.", "label": []}
{"id": 14882, "text": "Because it's just like the situation we had somewhere on the board here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14883, "text": "It's just like the situation we had up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14884, "text": "I've got a power of a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14885, "text": "So exactly the same substitution steps in.", "label": []}
{"id": 14886, "text": "You get, and maybe you can see what happens without doing the work.", "label": []}
{"id": 14887, "text": "Shall I do the work here?", "label": []}
{"id": 14888, "text": "I make the same substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14889, "text": "And so this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14890, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14891, "text": "But then I want to put this minus sign in place, and so that gives me <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14892, "text": "And then I back substitute and get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14893, "text": "So this is the easy case.", "label": []}
{"id": 14894, "text": "If you have some odd power to play with, then you can make use of it and it's pretty straightforward.", "label": []}
{"id": 14895, "text": "OK the harder case is when you don't have an odd power.", "label": []}
{"id": 14896, "text": "So what's the program?", "label": []}
{"id": 14897, "text": "I'm going to do the harder case, and then I'm going to show you an example of how to integrate square roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 14898, "text": "And do an application, using these ideas from trigonometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 14899, "text": "So I want to keep this blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 14900, "text": "Maybe I'll come back and start here again.", "label": []}
{"id": 14901, "text": "So the harder case is when they're only even exponents.", "label": []}

{"id": 14903, "text": "But now all the exponents are even.", "label": []}
{"id": 14904, "text": "So we have to do some game.", "label": []}
{"id": 14905, "text": "And here the game is use the half angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 14906, "text": "Which I just erased, very sadly, on the board here.", "label": []}

{"id": 14908, "text": "I think I remember what they were.", "label": []}
{"id": 14909, "text": "So the game is I'm going to use that half angle formula to start getting rid of those even powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 14910, "text": "Half angle formula written like this, exactly, talks about-- it rewrites even powers of sines and cosines.", "label": []}
{"id": 14911, "text": "So let's see how that works out in an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 14912, "text": "How about just the <EXPRESSION> for a start.", "label": []}

{"id": 14917, "text": "This is really the same as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14918, "text": "And now, this is easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 14919, "text": "It's got two parts to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 14920, "text": "Integrating <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION> over-- Oh.", "label": []}
{"id": 14921, "text": "Miraculously, the <EXPRESSION> turned into a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14923, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION> by integrating <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14924, "text": "So, notice that something non-trigonometric occurs here when I do these even integrals.", "label": []}
{"id": 14925, "text": "<EXPRESSION> appears.", "label": []}
{"id": 14926, "text": "And then the other one, OK, so this takes a little thought.", "label": []}
{"id": 14927, "text": "The integral of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, or is it minus the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 14930, "text": "I think it's positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 14931, "text": "And so you get <EXPRESSION>, but is that right?", "label": []}
{"id": 14932, "text": "Over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14933, "text": "If I differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, this <EXPRESSION> comes out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14934, "text": "And would give me an extra <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}

{"id": 14936, "text": "And there's the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 14937, "text": "This is not a substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 14938, "text": "I just played with trig identities here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14939, "text": "And then did a simple trig integral, getting your help to get the sign right.", "label": []}
{"id": 14940, "text": "And thinking about what this <EXPRESSION> is going to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 14941, "text": "It produces a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 14942, "text": "But it's not applying any complicated thing.", "label": []}

{"id": 14944, "text": "Let's do another example that's a little bit harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 14945, "text": "This time, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14946, "text": "Again, no odd powers.", "label": []}
{"id": 14947, "text": "I've got to work a little bit harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 14948, "text": "And what I'm going to do is apply those identities up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14949, "text": "Now, what I recommend doing in this situation is going over to the side somewhere.", "label": []}
{"id": 14950, "text": "And do some side work.", "label": []}
{"id": 14951, "text": "Because it's all just playing with trig functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 14952, "text": "It's not actually doing any integrals for a while.", "label": []}
{"id": 14953, "text": "So, I guess one way to get rid of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> is to use those identities and so let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14954, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14955, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14956, "text": "So I just substitute them in.", "label": []}
{"id": 14957, "text": "And now I can multiply that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 14958, "text": "And what I have is a difference times a sum.", "label": []}
{"id": 14959, "text": "So you know a formula for that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14960, "text": "Taking the product of these two things, well there'll be a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}

{"id": 14969, "text": "But we do know what to do about this.", "label": []}
{"id": 14970, "text": "Because I just did it up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14971, "text": "And I could play into this formula that we got.", "label": []}
{"id": 14972, "text": "But I think it's just as easy to continue to calculate here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14973, "text": "Use the half angle formula again for this, and continue on your way.", "label": []}
{"id": 14974, "text": "So I get a <EXPRESSION> from this bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 14975, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14976, "text": "And when I plug in <EXPRESSION> in for <EXPRESSION>, there in the top board, I'm going to get a <EXPRESSION> on the right-hand side.", "label": []}
{"id": 14977, "text": "So it comes out like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14978, "text": "And I guess I could simplify that a little bit more.", "label": []}
{"id": 14979, "text": "This is a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14980, "text": "Oh, but then there's a <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14981, "text": "It's half that.", "label": []}
{"id": 14982, "text": "So then I can simplify a little more.", "label": []}
{"id": 14983, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14984, "text": "And then I have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14985, "text": "OK, that's my side work.", "label": []}
{"id": 14986, "text": "I just did some trig identities over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14987, "text": "And rewrote <EXPRESSION> as something which involves just no powers of trig, just <EXPRESSION> by itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 14988, "text": "And a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 14989, "text": "So I can take that and substitute it in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14990, "text": "And now the integration is pretty easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 14991, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, which is, OK the <EXPRESSION> is going to give me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14992, "text": "The integral or <EXPRESSION> is plus or minus the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14993, "text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is plus the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 14994, "text": "So it's going to be plus the-- Only there's a minus here.", "label": []}
{"id": 14995, "text": "So it's going to be the <EXPRESSION>, but then I have an additional factor in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 14996, "text": "And what's it going to be?", "label": []}
{"id": 14997, "text": "I have to put a <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 14998, "text": "So we've done that calculation, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 14999, "text": "So any of these-- If you keep doing this kind of process, these two kinds of procedures, you can now integrate any expression that has a power of a <EXPRESSION> times a power of a <EXPRESSION> in it, by using these ideas.", "label": []}
{"id": 15000, "text": "Now, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15001, "text": "Oh, let me give you an alternate method for this last one here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15002, "text": "I know what I'll do.", "label": []}

{"id": 15004, "text": "I'm trying to deal with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15005, "text": "Well that's the square of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15006, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> shows up right here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15007, "text": "In another trig identity.", "label": []}
{"id": 15008, "text": "So we can make use of that, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 15009, "text": "That reduces the number of factors of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15010, "text": "So it's going in the right direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 15011, "text": "This = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15012, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>-- Say this right.", "label": []}
{"id": 15013, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, and then I want to square that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15014, "text": "So what I get is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15015, "text": "Which is, well, I'm not too happy yet, because I still have an even power.", "label": []}
{"id": 15016, "text": "Remember I'm trying to integrate this thing in the end, even powers are bad.", "label": []}
{"id": 15017, "text": "I try to get rid of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 15018, "text": "By using that formula, the half angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 15019, "text": "So I can apply that to <EXPRESSION> here again.", "label": []}
{"id": 15020, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15021, "text": "That's what the half angle formula says for <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15022, "text": "And that's exactly the same as the expression that I got up here, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15023, "text": "It's the same expression that I have there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15024, "text": "So it's the same expression as I have here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15025, "text": "So this is just an alternate way to play this game of using the half angle formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 15026, "text": "OK, let's do a little application of these things and change the topic a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 15027, "text": "So here's the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 15028, "text": "So this is an application and example of a real trig substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15029, "text": "So here's the problem I want to look at.", "label": []}
{"id": 15030, "text": "OK, so I have a circle whose radius is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15031, "text": "And I cut out from it a sort of tab, here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15032, "text": "This tab here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15033, "text": "And the height of this thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15034, "text": "So this length is a number <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15035, "text": "And what I want to do is compute the area of that little tab.", "label": []}
{"id": 15036, "text": "That's the problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 15037, "text": "So there's an arc over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15038, "text": "And I want to find the area of this, for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15039, "text": "So the area, well, I guess one way to compute the area would be to take the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15040, "text": "You've seen the idea of splitting this up into vertical strips whose height is given by a function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15041, "text": "And then you integrate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15042, "text": "That's an interpretation for the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15043, "text": "The area is given by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15044, "text": "But that's a little bit awkward, because my formula for <EXPRESSION> is going to be a little strange.", "label": []}
{"id": 15045, "text": "It's constant, value of <EXPRESSION>, along here, and then at this point it becomes this arc, of the circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15046, "text": "So working this out, I could do it but it's a little awkward because expressing <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>, the top edge of this shape, it's a little awkward, and takes two different regions to express.", "label": []}
{"id": 15047, "text": "So, a different way to say it is to say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15048, "text": "Maybe that'll work a little bit better.", "label": []}
{"id": 15049, "text": "Or maybe it won't, but it's worth trying.", "label": []}
{"id": 15050, "text": "I could just as well split this region up into horizontal strips.", "label": []}
{"id": 15051, "text": "Whose width is <EXPRESSION>, and whose length is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15052, "text": "Now I'm thinking of this as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15053, "text": "This is the graph of a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15054, "text": "And that's much better, because the function of <EXPRESSION> is, well, it's the square root of <EXPRESSION>, isn't it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15055, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15056, "text": "So that's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15057, "text": "And that's what I'm asked to integrate, then.", "label": []}
{"id": 15058, "text": "Square root of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15059, "text": "And I can even put in limits of integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 15060, "text": "Maybe I should do that, because this is supposed to be an actual number.", "label": []}
{"id": 15061, "text": "I guess I'm integrating it from <EQUATION>, that's here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15062, "text": "To <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15063, "text": "So this is what I want to find.", "label": []}
{"id": 15064, "text": "This is a integral formula for the area of that region.", "label": []}
{"id": 15065, "text": "And this is a new form.", "label": []}
{"id": 15066, "text": "I don't think that you've thought about integrating expressions like this in this class before.", "label": []}
{"id": 15067, "text": "So, it's a new form and I want to show you how to do it, how it's related to trigonometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 15068, "text": "It's related to trigonometry through that exact picture that we have on the blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 15069, "text": "After all, this <EXPRESSION> is the formula for this arc.", "label": []}
{"id": 15070, "text": "And so, what I propose is that we try to exploit the connection with the circle and introduce polar coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 15071, "text": "So, here if I measure this angle then there are various things you can say.", "label": []}
{"id": 15072, "text": "Like the coordinates of this point here are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>-- Well, I'm sorry, it's not.", "label": []}
{"id": 15073, "text": "That's an angle, but I want to call it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15074, "text": "And, in general you know that the coordinates of this point are (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).", "label": []}
{"id": 15075, "text": "If the radius is <EXPRESSION>, then the angle here is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15076, "text": "So <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, just from looking at the geometry of the circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15077, "text": "So let's make that substitution.", "label": []}

{"id": 15079, "text": "I'm using the picture to suggest that maybe making the substitution is a good thing to do.", "label": []}

{"id": 15112, "text": "And what it came out to, I used <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION> at the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 15113, "text": "So this is a good step forward.", "label": []}
{"id": 15114, "text": "I started with this integral that I really didn't know how to do by any means that we've had so far.", "label": []}
{"id": 15115, "text": "And I've replaced it by a trig integral that we do know how to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 15116, "text": "And now I've done that trig integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15117, "text": "But we're still not quite done, because of the problem of back substituting.", "label": []}
{"id": 15118, "text": "I'd like to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15119, "text": "Or, I'd like to go back and rewrite it in terms of the original limits of integration that we had in the original problem.", "label": []}
{"id": 15120, "text": "In doing that, it's going to be useful to rewrite this expression and get rid of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15121, "text": "After all, the original <EXPRESSION> was expressed in terms of <EXPRESSION>, not <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15122, "text": "So let me just do that here, and say that this, in turn, = <EXPRESSION> plus, well, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15123, "text": "And so, when there's a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, what I'll get is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15124, "text": "I did that because I'm getting closer to the original terms that the problem started with.", "label": []}
{"id": 15125, "text": "Which was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15126, "text": "So let me write down the integral that we have now.", "label": []}
{"id": 15127, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> is, so far, what we know is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15128, "text": "But I want to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original value.", "label": []}
{"id": 15129, "text": "The original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15130, "text": "Well, what is <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15131, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15132, "text": "<EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION> was given like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15133, "text": "So what is <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15134, "text": "Ah.", "label": []}
{"id": 15135, "text": "So here the fearsome <EXPRESSION> rears its head, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 15136, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the angle so that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15137, "text": "So that means that <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> inverse, of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15138, "text": "So that's the first thing that shows up here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15139, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, all over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15140, "text": "That's this term.", "label": []}
{"id": 15141, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15142, "text": "What about the other side, here?", "label": []}
{"id": 15143, "text": "Well <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, we knew what they were in terms of <EXPRESSION> and in terms of <EXPRESSION>, if you like.", "label": []}
{"id": 15144, "text": "Maybe I'll put the <EXPRESSION> inside here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15145, "text": "That makes it a little bit nicer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15146, "text": "Plus, and the other term is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15147, "text": "So the a <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15148, "text": "Maybe I'll write this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15149, "text": "And so I get the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 15150, "text": "And now here <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15151, "text": "And what's the <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15152, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, or, if you like, it's the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15153, "text": "And so there I've rewritten everything, back in terms of the original variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15154, "text": "And there's an answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15155, "text": "So I've done this indefinite integration of a form-- of this quadratic, this square root of something which is a constant minus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15156, "text": "Whenever you see that, the thing to think of is trigonometry.", "label": []}
{"id": 15157, "text": "That's going to play into the <EXPRESSION> identity.", "label": []}
{"id": 15158, "text": "And the way to exploit it is to make the substitution <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15159, "text": "You could also make a substitution <EQUATION>, if you wanted to.", "label": []}
{"id": 15160, "text": "And the result would come out to exactly the same in the end.", "label": []}
{"id": 15161, "text": "I'm still not quite done with the original problem that I had, because the original problem asked for a definite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15162, "text": "So let's just go back and finish that as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15163, "text": "So the area was the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of this square root.", "label": []}
{"id": 15164, "text": "So I just want to evaluate the right-hand side here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15165, "text": "The answer that we came up with, this indefinite integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15166, "text": "I want to evaluate it at <EXPRESSION> and at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15168, "text": "When I evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, times the <EXPRESSION>, putting <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15169, "text": "So I've plugged in <EQUATION> into that formula, this is what I get.", "label": []}
{"id": 15170, "text": "Then when I plug in <EQUATION>, well the, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15171, "text": "So this term goes away.", "label": []}
{"id": 15172, "text": "And when <EQUATION>, this term is <EXPRESSION> also.", "label": []}
{"id": 15173, "text": "And so I don't get any subtracted terms at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 15174, "text": "So there's an expression for this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15175, "text": "Notice that this <EXPRESSION>, that's exactly this angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15176, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, it's the angle that you get when <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15177, "text": "So this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15178, "text": "Put this over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15179, "text": "That is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15180, "text": "That is the angle that the corner makes.", "label": []}
{"id": 15181, "text": "So I could rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15182, "text": "Let's just think about this for a minute.", "label": []}
{"id": 15183, "text": "I have these two terms in the sum, is that reasonable?", "label": []}
{"id": 15184, "text": "The first term is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15185, "text": "That's the radius squared times this angle, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15186, "text": "Well, I think that is exactly the area of this sector.", "label": []}
{"id": 15187, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the formula for the area of the sector.", "label": []}
{"id": 15188, "text": "And this one, this is the vertical elevation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15189, "text": "This is the horizontal.", "label": []}
{"id": 15190, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is this distance.", "label": []}
{"id": 15191, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15192, "text": "So the right-hand term is <EXPRESSION> times <EXPRESSION>, that's the area of that triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15193, "text": "So using a little bit of geometry gives you the same answer as all of this elaborate calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 15194, "text": "Maybe that's enough cause for celebration for us to quit for today.", "label": []}
{"id": 15195, "text": "We hopefully know at this point what a differential equation is, so now let's try to solve some.", "label": []}
{"id": 15196, "text": "And this first class of differential equations I'll introduce you to, they're called separable equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 15197, "text": "And I think what you'll find is that we're not learning really anything new.", "label": []}
{"id": 15198, "text": "Using just your first year calculus derivative and integrating skills, you can solve a separable equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15199, "text": "And the reason why they're called separable is because you can actually separate the x and y terms, and integrate them separately to get the solution of the differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15200, "text": "So that's separable.", "label": []}
{"id": 15201, "text": "Separable equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 15202, "text": "So let's do a couple, and I think you'll get the point.", "label": []}
{"id": 15203, "text": "These often are really more of exercises in algebra than anything else.", "label": []}
{"id": 15204, "text": "So the first separable differential equation is: <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15205, "text": "And actually, this is a good time to just review our terminology.", "label": []}
{"id": 15206, "text": "So first of all, what is the order of this differential equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 15207, "text": "Well, the highest derivative in it is just the first derivative, so the order = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15208, "text": "So it's first order.", "label": []}
{"id": 15209, "text": "It's ordinary, because we only have a regular derivative, no partial derivatives here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15210, "text": "And then, is this linear or non-linear?", "label": []}
{"id": 15211, "text": "Well, first you say, oh well, you know, this looks linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 15212, "text": "I'm not multiplying the derivative times anything else.", "label": []}
{"id": 15213, "text": "But if you look carefully, something interesting is going on.", "label": []}
{"id": 15214, "text": "First of all, you have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15215, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is a dependent variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 15216, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15217, "text": "So to have the <EXPRESSION>, that makes it non-linear.", "label": []}
{"id": 15218, "text": "And even if this was <EXPRESSION>, if you were to actually multiply both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, and get in the form that I showed you in the previous equation, you would have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15219, "text": "This is actually the first step of what we have to do anyways, so I'll write it down.", "label": []}
{"id": 15220, "text": "So if I'm just multiplying both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, you get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15221, "text": "And then you immediately see that even if this wasn't a squared here, you'd be multiplying the <EXPRESSION>, and that also makes it non-linear because you're multiplying the dependent variable times the derivative of itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 15222, "text": "So that also makes this a non-linear equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15223, "text": "But anyway, let's get back to solving this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15224, "text": "So this is the first step.", "label": []}
{"id": 15225, "text": "I just multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15226, "text": "And the real end goal is just to separate the y's and the x's, and then integrate both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 15227, "text": "So I'm almost there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15228, "text": "So now what I want to do is I want to multiply both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION>, so I have a <EXPRESSION> here and get rid of this <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15229, "text": "Let me go here, I don't want to waste too much space.", "label": []}
{"id": 15230, "text": "So you get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15231, "text": "I have separated the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> variables and the differentials.", "label": []}
{"id": 15232, "text": "All I did is I multiplied both sides of this equation times <EXPRESSION> to get here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15233, "text": "Now, I can just integrate both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 15234, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15235, "text": "Whatever you do to one side of the equation you have to do the other.", "label": []}
{"id": 15236, "text": "That's true with regular equations or differential equations.", "label": []}
{"id": 15237, "text": "So we're going to integrate both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 15238, "text": "So what's the integral of this expression with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 15239, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15240, "text": "The integral of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, the integral of <EXPRESSION>, well that's minus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15241, "text": "And I'll write the plus <EXPRESSION> here just to kind of show you something, but you really don't have to write <EXPRESSION> on both sides.", "label": []}

{"id": 15245, "text": "I just want to show you that our plus c has never disappeared from when we were taking our traditional antiderivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 15246, "text": "And what's the derivative of this?", "label": []}
{"id": 15247, "text": "Well that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15248, "text": "And this is also going to have <EXPRESSION> due to the <EXPRESSION> variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 15249, "text": "Now, the reason why I did this magenta one in magenta and I labelled it like that, is because you really just have to write <EXPRESSION> on one side of the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15250, "text": "And if that doesn't make a lot of sense, let's subtract this <EXPRESSION> from both sides, and we get <EXPRESSION> minus-- let me scroll down a little bit, my <EXPRESSION> looks like a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15251, "text": "<EQUATION> plus the constant when we took the antiderivative of the <EXPRESSION>, minus the constant of the antiderivative when we took the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15253, "text": "I mean, we don't know what they are.", "label": []}
{"id": 15254, "text": "There are arbitrary constants.", "label": []}
{"id": 15255, "text": "So we could just write a general <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15256, "text": "So you could have just-- you have to have a constant, but it doesn't have to be on both sides of the equation, because they're arbitrary.", "label": []}
{"id": 15257, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, well, that's still just another constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15258, "text": "And then if we want to simplify this equation more, we can multiply both sides of this by <EXPRESSION>, just make it look nicer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15259, "text": "And you get <EQUATION> plus-- well, I could write <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15260, "text": "But once again, <EXPRESSION> is an arbitrary constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15261, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> times an arbitrary constant, that's just another arbitrary constant.", "label": []}

{"id": 15280, "text": "Clear image, different colors, so I have optimal space.", "label": []}

{"id": 15287, "text": "So let's multiply both sides by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15305, "text": "When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15335, "text": "So the explicit form that satisfies our initial condition, and we're getting a little geeky here, you could get rid of the plus, it's 1 minus this whole thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 15336, "text": "That's what satisfies our initial condition.", "label": []}
{"id": 15337, "text": "And you could figure out where it's satisfied, over what domain is it satisfied.", "label": []}
{"id": 15338, "text": "Well, that's satisfied when this term is positive, this becomes negative, and you get it's undefined in reals, and all of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15339, "text": "But anyway, I've run out of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 15340, "text": "See you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 15341, "text": "PROFESSOR: So we're going to continue to talk about trig integrals and trig substitutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15342, "text": "This is maybe the most technical part of this course, which maybe is why professor Jerison decided to just take a leave, go AWOL just now and let me take over for him.", "label": []}
{"id": 15343, "text": "But I'll do my best to help you learn this technique and it'll be useful for you.", "label": []}
{"id": 15344, "text": "So we've talked about trig integrals involving sines and cosines yesterday.", "label": []}
{"id": 15345, "text": "There's another whole world out there that involves these other trig polynomials-- trig functions, secant and tangent.", "label": []}
{"id": 15346, "text": "Let me just make a little table to remind you what they are.", "label": []}
{"id": 15347, "text": "Because I have trouble remembering myself, so I enjoy the opportunity to go back to remind myself of this stuff.", "label": []}
{"id": 15348, "text": "Let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15349, "text": "The secant is one over one of those things, which one is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 15350, "text": "It's weird, it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15351, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15352, "text": "Of course the tangent, we know.", "label": []}
{"id": 15353, "text": "It's the <EXPRESSION> over the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> is the other way around.", "label": []}
{"id": 15354, "text": "So when you put a \"co\" in front of it, it exchanges <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15355, "text": "Well, I have a few identities involving tangent and secant up there, in that little prepared blackboard up above.", "label": []}
{"id": 15356, "text": "Maybe I'll just go through and check that out to make sure that we're all on the same page with them.", "label": []}
{"id": 15357, "text": "So I'm going to claim that there's this trig identity at the top.", "label": []}
{"id": 15358, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15359, "text": "So let's just check that out.", "label": []}
{"id": 15360, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15361, "text": "And then whenever you see a <EXPRESSION> in trigonometry, you'll always have the option of writing as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15362, "text": "And if I do that, then I can divide the <EXPRESSION> into that first term.", "label": []}
{"id": 15363, "text": "And I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15364, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15365, "text": "Which is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15366, "text": "So there you go.", "label": []}
{"id": 15367, "text": "That checks the first one.", "label": []}
{"id": 15368, "text": "That's the main trig identity that's going to be behind what I talk about today.", "label": []}
{"id": 15369, "text": "That's the trigonometry identity part.", "label": []}
{"id": 15370, "text": "How about this piece of calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 15371, "text": "Can we calculate what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is?", "label": []}
{"id": 15372, "text": "Actually, I'm going to do that on this board.", "label": []}
{"id": 15373, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15374, "text": "So I think I was with you when we learned about the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 15375, "text": "Computing the derivative of a quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 15376, "text": "And the rule is, you take the numerator and you-- sorry, you take the derivative of the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15377, "text": "And you multiply it by the denominator, so that gives you <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15378, "text": "And then you take the numerator, take minus the numerator, and multiply that by the derivative of the denominator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15379, "text": "And you put all that over the square of the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15380, "text": "And now I look at that and before my eyes I see the same trig identity, <EQUATION>, appearing there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15381, "text": "This is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15382, "text": "And, good.", "label": []}
{"id": 15383, "text": "So that's what the claim was.", "label": []}
{"id": 15384, "text": "The derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15385, "text": "That immediately gives you an integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15386, "text": "Namely, the integral of <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15387, "text": "That's the fundamental theorem of calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 15388, "text": "So we verified the first integral there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15389, "text": "Well, let's just do the second one as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15390, "text": "So if I want to differentiate the <EXPRESSION>, derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15391, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15392, "text": "And again, I have a quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 15393, "text": "This one's a little easier because the numerator's so simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 15394, "text": "So I take the derivative of the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15395, "text": "And then I take the numerator, I take minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15396, "text": "Which is <EXPRESSION>, and put all that over the square of the same denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15397, "text": "So one minus sign came from the quotient rule, and the other one came because that's the derivative of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15398, "text": "But they cancel, and so I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> and so that's the <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15399, "text": "So, not hard.", "label": []}
{"id": 15400, "text": "That verifies that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15401, "text": "And it tells you that the integral of that weird thing in case you ever want to know, the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15402, "text": "Well, there are a couple more integrals that I want to do for you.", "label": []}
{"id": 15403, "text": "Where I can't sort of work backwards like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15404, "text": "Let's calculate the integral of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15405, "text": "Just do this straight out.", "label": []}
{"id": 15406, "text": "So the <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15407, "text": "And now there's a habit of mind, that I hope you get into.", "label": []}
{"id": 15408, "text": "When you see the <EXPRESSION> and you're calculating an integral like this, it's useful to remember what the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15409, "text": "Because maybe it shows up somewhere else in the integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15410, "text": "And that happens here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15411, "text": "So that suggests we make a substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15412, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15413, "text": "Which means <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15414, "text": "That's the numerator, except for the minus sign.", "label": []}
{"id": 15415, "text": "And so I can rewrite this as, under the substitution, I can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>, that's the numerator, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15416, "text": "Well, I know how to do that integral too.", "label": []}
{"id": 15417, "text": "That gives me the natural log, doesn't it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15418, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15419, "text": "I'm not quite done.", "label": []}
{"id": 15420, "text": "I have to back-substitute and replace this new variable that I've made up, called <EXPRESSION>, with what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15421, "text": "And what you get is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15422, "text": "So the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15423, "text": "Now, you find these tables of integrals in the back of the book.", "label": []}
{"id": 15424, "text": "Things like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15425, "text": "I'm not sure how much memorization Professor Jerison is going to ask of you, but there is a certain amount of memorization that goes on in calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 15426, "text": "And this is one of the kinds of things that you probably want to know.", "label": []}
{"id": 15427, "text": "Let me do one more integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15428, "text": "I think I'm making my way through a prepared board here, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15429, "text": "Good.", "label": []}
{"id": 15430, "text": "So the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15431, "text": "I'd also like to know what the integral of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15432, "text": "And I don't know a way to kind of go straight at this, but let me show you a way to think your way through to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15433, "text": "If I take these two facts, <EXPRESSION> is what it is, and <EXPRESSION> is what it is, and add them together, I get this fact.", "label": []}
{"id": 15434, "text": "That the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is, well, it's the sum of these two things.", "label": []}
{"id": 15435, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15436, "text": "And there's a <EXPRESSION> that occurs in both of those terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 15437, "text": "So I'll factor it out.", "label": []}
{"id": 15438, "text": "And that gives me, I'll put it over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15439, "text": "There's the <EXPRESSION> that occurs in both terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 15440, "text": "And then in one term, there's another <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15441, "text": "And in the other term, there's a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15442, "text": "So that's interesting somehow, because this same term appears on both sides of this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15443, "text": "Let's write <EXPRESSION>, for that <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15444, "text": "And so the equation that I get is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15445, "text": "I've just made a direct substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15446, "text": "Just decide that I'm going to write <EXPRESSION> for that single thing that occurs on both sides of the equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15447, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is on the left, and <EXPRESSION> is on the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 15448, "text": "Well, there's my secant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15449, "text": "That I was trying to integrate.", "label": []}
{"id": 15450, "text": "And what it tells you is that = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15451, "text": "Just divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, and I get this equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 15452, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, that has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 15453, "text": "Not sure that professor Jerison's used this in this class, but <EXPRESSION>, we've actually used something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15454, "text": "It's on the board right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 15455, "text": "It's a logarithmic derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 15456, "text": "It is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15457, "text": "Maybe it's easier to read this from right to left, if I want to calculate the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, well, the chain rule says I get the derivative of <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15458, "text": "So often <EXPRESSION> is called the logarithmic derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 15459, "text": "But it's done what I wanted.", "label": []}
{"id": 15460, "text": "Because it's expressed the secant as a derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 15461, "text": "And I guess I should put in what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15462, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15463, "text": "And so that implies that the integral-- Integrate both sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 15464, "text": "That says that the integral of <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15465, "text": "So that's the last line in this little memo that I created.", "label": []}
{"id": 15466, "text": "That we can use now for the rest of the class.", "label": []}
{"id": 15467, "text": "Any questions about that trick?", "label": []}
{"id": 15468, "text": "It's a trick, I have nothing more to say about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15469, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 15470, "text": "So, the next thing I-- oh yes, so now I want to make the point that using these rules and some thought, you can now integrate most trigonometric polynomials.", "label": []}
{"id": 15471, "text": "Most things that involve powers of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and everything else.", "label": []}
{"id": 15472, "text": "For example, let's try to integrate the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15473, "text": "Big power of the <EXPRESSION> function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15474, "text": "Well, there are too many <EXPRESSION> there for me.", "label": []}
{"id": 15475, "text": "So let's take some away.", "label": []}
{"id": 15476, "text": "And I can take them away by using that trig identity, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15477, "text": "So I'm going to replace two of those <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15478, "text": "That leaves me with two left over.", "label": []}
{"id": 15479, "text": "Now there was method to my madness.", "label": []}
{"id": 15480, "text": "Because I've got a <EXPRESSION> left over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15481, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15482, "text": "So that suggests a substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15483, "text": "Namely, let's say, let's let <EQUATION>, so that <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15484, "text": "And I have both terms that occur in my integral sitting there very nicely.", "label": []}
{"id": 15485, "text": "So this is the possibility of making this substitution and seeing a secant squared up here as part of the differential here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15486, "text": "That's why it was a good idea for me to take two of the <EXPRESSION> and write them as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15487, "text": "So now I can continue this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15488, "text": "Under that substitution, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15489, "text": "Oh yeah, and I should add the other fact, that-- Well I guess it's obvious that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15490, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15491, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION>, that is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15492, "text": "Well that's pretty easy to integrate.", "label": []}
{"id": 15493, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15494, "text": "Plus a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15495, "text": "And then I just have to back-substitute.", "label": []}
{"id": 15496, "text": "Put things back in terms of the original variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 15497, "text": "And that gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15498, "text": "And there's the answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15499, "text": "So we could spend a lot more time doing more examples of this kind of polynomial trig thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 15500, "text": "It's probably best for you to do some practice on your own.", "label": []}
{"id": 15501, "text": "Because I want to talk about other things, also.", "label": []}
{"id": 15502, "text": "And what I want to talk about is the use of these trig identities in making really trig substitution integration.", "label": []}
{"id": 15503, "text": "So we did a little bit of this yesterday, and I'll show you some more examples today.", "label": []}
{"id": 15504, "text": "Let's start with a pretty hard example right off the bat.", "label": []}
{"id": 15505, "text": "So this is going to be the integral of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15506, "text": "It's a pretty bad looking integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15507, "text": "So how can we approach this?", "label": []}
{"id": 15508, "text": "Well, the square root is the ugliest part of the integral, I think.", "label": []}
{"id": 15509, "text": "What we should try to do is write this square root in some nicer way.", "label": []}
{"id": 15510, "text": "That is, figure out a way to write <EXPRESSION> as a square.", "label": []}
{"id": 15511, "text": "That'll get rid of the square root.", "label": []}
{"id": 15512, "text": "So there is an example of a way to write <EXPRESSION> plus something squared in a different way.", "label": []}
{"id": 15513, "text": "And it's right up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15514, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15515, "text": "So I want to use that idea.", "label": []}
{"id": 15516, "text": "And when I see this form, that suggests that we make a trig substitution and write <EXPRESSION> as the <EXPRESSION> of some new variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 15517, "text": "Which you might as well call <EXPRESSION>, to because it's like an angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15518, "text": "Then <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15519, "text": "According to that trig identity.", "label": []}
{"id": 15520, "text": "And so the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15521, "text": "Right?", "label": []}
{"id": 15522, "text": "So this identity is the reason that the substitution is going to help us.", "label": []}
{"id": 15523, "text": "Because it gets rid of the square root and replaces it by some other trig function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15524, "text": "I'd better be able to get rid of the <EXPRESSION>, too.", "label": []}
{"id": 15525, "text": "That's part of the substitution process.", "label": []}
{"id": 15526, "text": "But we can do that, because I know what the derivative of the <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15527, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15528, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15529, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15530, "text": "So let's just substitute all of that stuff in, and rewrite the entire integral in terms of our new variable, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15531, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is in the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15532, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15533, "text": "And then the denominator, well, it has an <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15534, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15535, "text": "And then there's this square root.", "label": []}
{"id": 15536, "text": "And we know what that is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15537, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15538, "text": "OK, now.", "label": []}
{"id": 15539, "text": "we've done the trig substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15540, "text": "I've gotten rid of the square root, I've got everything in terms of trig functions of the new variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 15541, "text": "Pretty complicated trig function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15542, "text": "This often happens, you wind up with a complete scattering of different trig functions in the numerator and denominator and everything.", "label": []}
{"id": 15543, "text": "A systematic thing to do here is to put everything in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15544, "text": "Unless you can see right away, how it's going to simplify, the systematic thing to do is to rewrite in terms of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15545, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15546, "text": "So let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 15547, "text": "The <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15548, "text": "So I'm going to put a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15549, "text": "Oh, I guess the first thing I can do is cancel.", "label": []}
{"id": 15550, "text": "Let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15551, "text": "That's clever.", "label": []}
{"id": 15552, "text": "You were all thinking that too.", "label": []}
{"id": 15553, "text": "Cancel those.", "label": []}
{"id": 15554, "text": "So now I just get <EXPRESSION> denominator from <EXPRESSION> there in the numerator.", "label": []}
{"id": 15555, "text": "It's still pretty complicated, <EXPRESSION>, who knows.", "label": []}
{"id": 15556, "text": "Well, we'll find out.", "label": []}
{"id": 15557, "text": "Because the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15558, "text": "So I should put a <EXPRESSION> where the <EXPRESSION> was, and <EXPRESSION> up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15559, "text": "And I still have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15560, "text": "And now you see some more cancellation occurs.", "label": []}
{"id": 15561, "text": "That's the virtue of writing things out in this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 15562, "text": "So now, the square here cancels with this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15563, "text": "And I'm left with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15571, "text": "And say <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15627, "text": "And what I know is, <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15628, "text": "So the tangent of <EXPRESSION>, tangent of this angle, is opposite divided by adjacent.", "label": []}
{"id": 15629, "text": "Did you learn SOH CAH TOA?", "label": []}
{"id": 15630, "text": "OK, so it's opposite divided by adjacent.", "label": []}
{"id": 15631, "text": "Is the tangent.", "label": []}
{"id": 15632, "text": "So there are different ways to do that, but why not just do it in the simplest way and suppose that the adjacent is <EXPRESSION>, and the opposite is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15634, "text": "I get the correct value for the tangent of theta by saying that the lengths of those are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15646, "text": "I've figured out what this cosecant of <EXPRESSION> is, in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15649, "text": "I illustrated several things.", "label": []}

{"id": 15652, "text": "I illustrated patience.", "label": []}
{"id": 15653, "text": "I illustrated rewriting things in terms of sines and cosines, and then making a direct substitution to evaluate an integral like this.", "label": []}

{"id": 15655, "text": "And it culminated with undoing the trig sub.", "label": []}
{"id": 15656, "text": "So let's play a game here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15657, "text": "Why don't we play the game where you give me-- So, there's a step in here that I should have done.", "label": []}
{"id": 15658, "text": "I should've said this is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15659, "text": "The most straightforward thing you can do is to say since <EXPRESSION> is the tangent of <EXPRESSION>, that means that-- sorry, if <EXPRESSION>, that means that <EXPRESSION> is the arctangent of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15661, "text": "So really, what I just did for you was to show you a way to compute some trig function applied to the inverse of another trig function.", "label": []}
{"id": 15662, "text": "I computed cosecant of the arctangent by this trick.", "label": []}
{"id": 15663, "text": "So now, let's play the game where you give me a trig function and an inverse trig function, and I try to compute what the composite is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15664, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 15665, "text": "So who can give me a trig function.", "label": []}

{"id": 15675, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Right, <EXPRESSION> has the best cheer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15676, "text": "So that's the game.", "label": []}
{"id": 15677, "text": "We have to compute, try to compute, that composite.", "label": []}
{"id": 15678, "text": "Something wrong with this?", "label": []}
{"id": 15679, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: What does acceptable mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 15680, "text": "Don't you think-- so the question is, isn't this a perfectly acceptable final answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15681, "text": "It's a correct final answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15682, "text": "But this is much more insightful.", "label": []}
{"id": 15683, "text": "And after all the original thing was involving square roots and things, this is the kind of thing you might hope for is an answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 15684, "text": "This is just a nicer answer for sure.", "label": []}
{"id": 15685, "text": "And likely to be more useful to you when you go on and use that answer for something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 15686, "text": "OK, so let's try to do this this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15687, "text": "Undo a trig substitution that involved a cosecant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15688, "text": "And I manipulate around, and I find myself trying to find out what's the tangent of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15689, "text": "So here's how we go about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 15690, "text": "I draw this triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15691, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the angle here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15692, "text": "This is the adjacent, opposite, hypotenuse.", "label": []}
{"id": 15693, "text": "So, the first thing is how can I make the cosecant appear here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15694, "text": "What dimensions should I give to the sides in order for the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>, sorry, in order for <EXPRESSION> to be the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15695, "text": "This thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15696, "text": "So, that means that the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>-- that means the cosecant of <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15697, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is the arccosecant, so <EXPRESSION> is the cosecant of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15698, "text": "So, what'll I take the sides to be, to get the cosecant?", "label": []}
{"id": 15699, "text": "The cosecant is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15700, "text": "And the <EXPRESSION> is the opposite over the hypotenuse.", "label": []}
{"id": 15701, "text": "So I get hypotenuse over opposite.", "label": []}
{"id": 15702, "text": "And that's supposed to be what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 15703, "text": "So I could make the opposite anything I want, but the simplest thing is to make it <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15704, "text": "Let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15705, "text": "And then what does that mean about the rest of the sides?", "label": []}
{"id": 15706, "text": "Hypotenuse had better be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15707, "text": "And then I've recovered this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15708, "text": "So here's a triangle that exhibits the correct angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15709, "text": "This remaining side is going to be useful to us.", "label": []}
{"id": 15710, "text": "And it is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15711, "text": "So I've got a triangle of the correct angle <EXPRESSION>, and now I want to compute the tangent of that angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15712, "text": "Well, that's easy.", "label": []}
{"id": 15713, "text": "That's opposite divided by adjacent.", "label": []}
{"id": 15714, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15715, "text": "Very flexible tool that'll be useful to you in many different times.", "label": []}
{"id": 15716, "text": "Whenever you have to undo a trig substitution, this is likely to be useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 15717, "text": "OK, that was a good game.", "label": []}
{"id": 15718, "text": "No winners in this game.", "label": []}
{"id": 15719, "text": "We're all winners.", "label": []}

{"id": 15721, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 15722, "text": "So, good.", "label": []}
{"id": 15723, "text": "So let me make this table of the different trig substitutions, and how they can be useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 15724, "text": "Summary of trig substitutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15725, "text": "So over here, we have, if you see, so if your integrand contains, make a substitution to get.", "label": []}
{"id": 15726, "text": "So if your integrand contains, I'll write these things out as square roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 15727, "text": "If it contains the <EXPRESSION>, this is what we talked about on Thursday.", "label": []}
{"id": 15728, "text": "When I was trying to find the area of that piece of a circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 15729, "text": "There, I suggested that we should make the substitution <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15731, "text": "Either one works just as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15732, "text": "And there's no way to prefer one over the other.", "label": []}
{"id": 15733, "text": "And when you make the substitution, <EQUATION>, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15734, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15735, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15736, "text": "So you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15737, "text": "So this expression becomes = this expression under that substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15738, "text": "And then you go on.", "label": []}
{"id": 15739, "text": "Then you've gotten rid of the square root, and you've got a trigonometric integral that you have to try to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 15740, "text": "If you made the substitution <EXPRESSION>, you'd get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15741, "text": "And then you can go ahead as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 15742, "text": "We just saw another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 15743, "text": "Namely, if you have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 15745, "text": "<EQUATION> in this example.", "label": []}
{"id": 15746, "text": "What did we do?", "label": []}
{"id": 15747, "text": "We tried the substitution <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15748, "text": "And the reason is that I can plug into the trig identity up here in the upper left.", "label": []}
{"id": 15749, "text": "And replace <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15750, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15751, "text": "There's one more thing in this table.", "label": []}
{"id": 15752, "text": "Sort of, the only remaining sum or difference of terms like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 15753, "text": "And that's what happens if you have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15754, "text": "So there, I think we can make a substitution a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15755, "text": "Because, after all, <EXPRESSION>-- so <EXPRESSION> - <EXPRESSION>-- Sorry.", "label": []}
{"id": 15756, "text": "Let's see what happens when I make that substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15757, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15758, "text": "Under this substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15759, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15760, "text": "Well, put the <EXPRESSION> on the other side.", "label": []}
{"id": 15761, "text": "And you find <EXPRESSION>, coming out.", "label": []}
{"id": 15762, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15763, "text": "And so that's what you get, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15764, "text": "After I take the square root, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15765, "text": "So these are the three basic trig substitution forms.", "label": []}
{"id": 15766, "text": "Where trig substitutions are useful to get rid of expressions like this, and replace them by trigonometric expressions.", "label": []}
{"id": 15767, "text": "And then you use this trick, you do the integral if you can and then you use this trick to get rid of the <EXPRESSION> at the end.", "label": []}
{"id": 15768, "text": "So now, the last thing I want to talk about today is called completing the square.", "label": []}
{"id": 15769, "text": "And that comes in because unfortunately, not every square root of a quadratic has such a simple form.", "label": []}
{"id": 15770, "text": "You will often encounter things that are not just the square root of something simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 15771, "text": "Like one of these forms.", "label": []}
{"id": 15772, "text": "Like there might be a middle term in there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15773, "text": "I don't actually have time to show you an example of how this comes out in a sort of practical example.", "label": []}
{"id": 15774, "text": "But it does happen quite frequently.", "label": []}
{"id": 15775, "text": "And so I want to show you how to deal with things like the following example.", "label": []}
{"id": 15776, "text": "Let's try to integrate <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15777, "text": "So there's a square root of some square, some quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 15778, "text": "It's very much like this business.", "label": []}
{"id": 15779, "text": "But it isn't of any of these forms.", "label": []}
{"id": 15780, "text": "And so what I want to do is show you how to rewrite it in one of those forms using substitution, again.", "label": []}
{"id": 15781, "text": "All this is about substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 15782, "text": "So the game is to rewrite quadratic as something like <EXPRESSION> plus something or other.", "label": []}
{"id": 15783, "text": "Plus some other constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15784, "text": "So write it, try to write it, in the form of a square plus or minus another constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 15785, "text": "And then we'll go on from there.", "label": []}
{"id": 15786, "text": "So let's do that in this case.", "label": []}
{"id": 15787, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15788, "text": "Well, if you square this form out, then the middle term is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15789, "text": "So that, since I have a middle term here, I pretty much know what a has to be.", "label": []}
{"id": 15790, "text": "The only choice in order to get something like <EXPRESSION> out of this, is to take a to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15791, "text": "Because then, this is what you get.", "label": []}
{"id": 15792, "text": "This isn't quite right yet, but let's compute what I have here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15793, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, so far so good, plus <EXPRESSION>, and I don't have a plus <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 15794, "text": "So I have to fix that by subtracting <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15795, "text": "So that's what I mean.", "label": []}
{"id": 15796, "text": "I've completed the square.", "label": []}
{"id": 15797, "text": "The word for this process of eliminating the middle term by using the square of an expression like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15798, "text": "That's called completing the square.", "label": []}
{"id": 15799, "text": "And we can use that process to compute this integral.", "label": []}
{"id": 15800, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 15801, "text": "So I can rewrite this integral, rewrite this denominator like this.", "label": []}

{"id": 15821, "text": "That tells me what I want.", "label": []}
{"id": 15822, "text": "So to handle this, what I should use is a trig substitution.", "label": []}

{"id": 15877, "text": "And I don't have to go through and use that triangle trick.", "label": []}

{"id": 15893, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 15894, "text": "So I've gotten back to a function purely in terms of <EXPRESSION> OK, that's a good place to quit.", "label": []}

{"id": 15897, "text": "Bye.", "label": []}
{"id": 5201, "text": "So, if you remember last time, we looked at parametric equations -- -- as a way of describing the motion of a point that moves in the plane or in space as a function of time of your favorite parameter that will tell you how far the motion has progressed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5202, "text": "And, I think we did it in detail the example of the cycloid, which is the curve traced by a point on a wheel that's rolling on a flat surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 5203, "text": "So, we have this example where we have this wheel that's rolling on the x-axis, and we have this point on the wheel.", "label": []}
{"id": 5204, "text": "And, as it moves around, it traces a trajectory that moves more or less like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 5205, "text": "OK, so I'm trying a new color.", "label": []}
{"id": 5206, "text": "Is this visible from the back?", "label": []}
{"id": 5207, "text": "So, no more blue.", "label": []}
{"id": 5208, "text": "OK, so remember, in general, we are trying to find the position, so, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, maybe <EXPRESSION> if we are in space -- -- of a moving point along a trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5209, "text": "And, one way to think about this is in terms of the position vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5210, "text": "So, position vector is just the vector whose components are coordinates of a point, OK, so if you prefer, that's the same thing as a vector from the origin to the moving point.", "label": []}
{"id": 5211, "text": "So, maybe our point is here, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5212, "text": "So, this vector here -- This vector here is vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5213, "text": "And, that's also the position vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5214, "text": "So, just to give you, again, that example -- -- if I take the cycloid for a wheel of radius <EXPRESSION>, and let's say that we are going at unit speed so that the angle that we used as a parameter of time is the same thing as time when the position vector, in this case, we found to be, just to make sure that they have it right, .", "label": []}
{"id": 5215, "text": "OK, that's a formula that you should have in your notes from last time, except we had <EXPRESSION> instead of <EXPRESSION> because we were using the angle.", "label": []}
{"id": 5216, "text": "But now I'm saying, we are moving at unit speed, so time and angle are the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 5217, "text": "So, now, what's interesting about this is we can analyze the motion in more detail.", "label": []}
{"id": 5218, "text": "OK, so, now that we know the position of the point as a function of time, we can try to study how it varies in particular things like the speed and acceleration.", "label": []}
{"id": 5219, "text": "OK, so let's start with speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5220, "text": "Well, in fact we can do better than speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5221, "text": "Let's not start with speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5222, "text": "So, speed is a number.", "label": []}
{"id": 5223, "text": "It tells you how fast you are going along your trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5224, "text": "I mean, if you're driving in a car, then it tells you how fast you are going.", "label": []}
{"id": 5225, "text": "But, unless you have one of these fancy cars with a GPS, it doesn't tell you which direction you're going.", "label": []}
{"id": 5226, "text": "And, that's useful information, too, if you're trying to figure out what your trajectory is.", "label": []}
{"id": 5227, "text": "So, in fact, there's two aspects to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 5228, "text": "One is how fast you are going, and the other is in what direction you're going.", "label": []}
{"id": 5229, "text": "That means actually we should use a vector maybe to think about this.", "label": []}
{"id": 5230, "text": "And so, that's called the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5231, "text": "And, the way we can get it, so, it's called usually <EXPRESSION>, so, <EXPRESSION> here stands for velocity more than for vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5232, "text": "And, you just get it by taking the derivative of a position vector with respect to time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5233, "text": "Now, it's our first time writing this kind of thing with a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5234, "text": "So, the basic rule is you can take the derivative of a vector quantity just by taking the derivatives of each component.", "label": []}
{"id": 5235, "text": "OK, so that's just <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and if you have <EXPRESSION> component, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5236, "text": "So, let me -- OK, so -- OK, so let's see what it is for the cycloid.", "label": []}
{"id": 5237, "text": "So, an example of a cycloid, well, so what do we get when we take the derivatives of this formula there?", "label": []}
{"id": 5238, "text": "Well, so, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5239, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5240, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5241, "text": "Very good.", "label": []}
{"id": 5242, "text": "OK, that's at least one thing you should remember from single variable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 5243, "text": "Hopefully you remember even more than that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5244, "text": "OK, so that's the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5245, "text": "It tells us at any time how fast we are going, and in what direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5246, "text": "So, for example, observe.", "label": []}
{"id": 5247, "text": "Remember last time at the end of class we were trying to figure out what exactly happens near the bottom point, when we have this motion that seems to stop and go backwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 5248, "text": "And, we answered that one way.", "label": []}
{"id": 5249, "text": "But, let's try to understand it in terms of velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 5250, "text": "What if I plug <EQUATION> in here?", "label": []}
{"id": 5251, "text": "Then, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5252, "text": "The velocity is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5253, "text": "So, at the time, at that particular time, our point is actually not moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 5254, "text": "Of course, it's been moving just before, and it starts moving just afterwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 5255, "text": "It's just the instant, at that particular instant, the speed is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5256, "text": "So, that's especially maybe a counterintuitive thing, but something is moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 5257, "text": "And at that time, it's actually stopped.", "label": []}
{"id": 5258, "text": "Now, let's see, so that's the vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5259, "text": "And, it's useful.", "label": []}
{"id": 5260, "text": "But, if you want just the usual speed as a number, then, what will you do?", "label": []}
{"id": 5261, "text": "Well, you will just take exactly the magnitude of this vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5262, "text": "So, speed, which is the scalar quantity is going to be just the magnitude of the vector, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5263, "text": "OK, so, in this case, while it would be <EXPRESSION>, and if you expand that, you will get, let me take a bit more space, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5264, "text": "It seems to simplify a little bit because we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5265, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5266, "text": "So, it's going to be the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5267, "text": "So, at this point, if I was going to ask you, when is the speed the smallest or the largest?", "label": []}
{"id": 5268, "text": "You could answer based on that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5269, "text": "See, at <EQUATION>, well, that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5270, "text": "The point is not moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 5271, "text": "At <EQUATION>, that ends up being <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5272, "text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5273, "text": "And, that's when you're truly at the top of the arch, and that's when the point is moving the fastest.", "label": []}
{"id": 5274, "text": "In fact, they are spending twice as fast as the wheel because the wheel is moving to the right at unit speed, and the wheel is also rotating.", "label": []}
{"id": 5275, "text": "So, it's moving to the right and unit speed relative to the center so that the two effects add up, and give you a speed of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5276, "text": "Anyway, that's a formula we can get.", "label": []}
{"id": 5277, "text": "OK, now, what about acceleration?", "label": []}
{"id": 5278, "text": "So, here I should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration, the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using.", "label": []}
{"id": 5279, "text": "So, you might think acceleration is just the directive of speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5280, "text": "If my car goes <EXPRESSION> miles an hour on the highway and it's going a constant speed, it's not accelerating.", "label": []}
{"id": 5281, "text": "But, let's say that I'm taking a really tight turn.", "label": []}
{"id": 5282, "text": "Then, I'm going to feel something.", "label": []}
{"id": 5283, "text": "There is some force being exerted.", "label": []}
{"id": 5284, "text": "And, in fact, there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing.", "label": []}
{"id": 5285, "text": "So, the definition will take effect.", "label": []}
{"id": 5286, "text": "The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5287, "text": "So, even if the speed is constant, that means, even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same, the velocity vector can still rotate.", "label": []}
{"id": 5288, "text": "And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.", "label": []}
{"id": 5289, "text": "OK, and so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant to physics when you find <EQUATION>; that's the (a) that you have in mind here.", "label": []}
{"id": 5290, "text": "It's a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5291, "text": "Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 5292, "text": "I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5293, "text": "But, in general, that's not quite the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 5294, "text": "So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.", "label": []}
{"id": 5295, "text": "If we take the example of the cycloid, well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 5296, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5297, "text": "And, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 5298, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 5299, "text": "So, the acceleration vector is.", "label": []}
{"id": 5300, "text": "So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 5301, "text": "Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5302, "text": "So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5303, "text": "It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5304, "text": "So, my point is not moving at that particular time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5305, "text": "But, it's accelerating up.", "label": []}
{"id": 5306, "text": "So, that means that actually as it comes down, first it's slowing down.", "label": []}
{"id": 5307, "text": "Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.", "label": []}
{"id": 5308, "text": "OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5309, "text": "OK, any questions about that?", "label": []}
{"id": 5310, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 5311, "text": "OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.", "label": []}
{"id": 5312, "text": "One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5313, "text": "OK, this is completely false.", "label": []}
{"id": 5314, "text": "And, they are really not the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 5315, "text": "So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.", "label": []}
{"id": 5316, "text": "If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.", "label": []}
{"id": 5317, "text": "And, you can get there.", "label": []}
{"id": 5318, "text": "But, it will not be a very nice expression.", "label": []}
{"id": 5319, "text": "There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 5320, "text": "Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 5321, "text": "What's more relevant might be this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 5322, "text": "This is actually the speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5323, "text": "This one, I don't know what it means.", "label": []}
{"id": 5324, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 5325, "text": "So, let's continue our exploration.", "label": []}
{"id": 5326, "text": "So, the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.", "label": []}
{"id": 5327, "text": "So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5328, "text": "So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.", "label": []}
{"id": 5329, "text": "And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.", "label": []}
{"id": 5330, "text": "So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.", "label": []}
{"id": 5331, "text": "I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5332, "text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5333, "text": "And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.", "label": []}
{"id": 5334, "text": "Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 5335, "text": "In general, maybe you would say you start at time, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5336, "text": "But, it's a convention.", "label": []}
{"id": 5337, "text": "If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.", "label": []}
{"id": 5338, "text": "I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.", "label": []}
{"id": 5339, "text": "I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 5340, "text": "Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.", "label": []}
{"id": 5341, "text": "So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?", "label": []}
{"id": 5342, "text": "Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?", "label": []}
{"id": 5343, "text": "Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5344, "text": "OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5345, "text": "And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5346, "text": "Actually, maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5347, "text": "I mean, you get to choose how you count it.", "label": []}
{"id": 5348, "text": "But, in this case, if you are moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 5349, "text": "So -- So if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5350, "text": "So, if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is, you have this nice-looking curve; how long is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 5351, "text": "Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5352, "text": "And, to say the truth, I don't really know how to integrate that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5353, "text": "So, we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 5354, "text": "However, we'll see one later using a cool trick, and multi-variable calculus.", "label": []}
{"id": 5355, "text": "So, for now, we'll just leave the formula like that, and we don't know how long it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 5356, "text": "Well, you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value.", "label": []}
{"id": 5357, "text": "But, that's the best I can offer.", "label": []}
{"id": 5358, "text": "Now, another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5359, "text": "So, the usual notation is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5360, "text": "It has a hat because it's a unit vector, and <EXPRESSION> because it's tangent.", "label": []}
{"id": 5361, "text": "Now, how do we get this unit vector?", "label": []}
{"id": 5362, "text": "So, maybe I should have pointed out before that if you're moving along some trajectory, say you're going in that direction, then when you're at this point, the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5363, "text": "It tells you the direction of motion in particular.", "label": []}
{"id": 5364, "text": "So, if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is rescale it, so, at its length becomes one.", "label": []}
{"id": 5365, "text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> divided by a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5366, "text": "So, it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way.", "label": []}
{"id": 5367, "text": "So, let's see what we can say.", "label": []}
{"id": 5368, "text": "Well, we can say that <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, so, that's the velocity vector, that's the same thing as if I use the chain rule <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5369, "text": "OK, so, let's think about this things.", "label": []}
{"id": 5370, "text": "So, this guy here we've just seen.", "label": []}
{"id": 5371, "text": "That's the same as the speed, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5372, "text": "So, this one here should be <EXPRESSION> divided by its length.", "label": []}
{"id": 5373, "text": "So, that means this actually should be the unit vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5374, "text": "OK, so, let me rewrite that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5375, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5376, "text": "So, maybe if I actually stated directly that way, see, I'm just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5377, "text": "The length is the speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5378, "text": "The direction is tangent to the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5379, "text": "So, the speed is <EXPRESSION>, and the vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5380, "text": "And, that's how we get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 5381, "text": "So, let's try just to see why <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5382, "text": "Well, let's think of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5383, "text": "<EXPRESSION> means position vector <EXPRESSION> means you have the origin, which is somewhere out there, and the vector <EXPRESSION> is here.", "label": []}
{"id": 5384, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> means we move by a small amount, <EXPRESSION> along the trajectory a certain distance <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5385, "text": "And, we look at how the position vector changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 5386, "text": "Well, we'll have a small change.", "label": []}
{"id": 5387, "text": "Let me call that vector <EXPRESSION> corresponding to the size, corresponding to the length <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5388, "text": "And now, <EXPRESSION> should be essentially roughly =, well, its direction will be tangent to the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5389, "text": "If I take a small enough interval, then the direction will be almost tensioned to the trajectory times the length of it will be <EXPRESSION>, the distance that I have traveled.", "label": []}
{"id": 5390, "text": "OK, sorry, maybe I should explain that on a separate board.", "label": []}
{"id": 5391, "text": "OK, so, let's say that we have that amount of time, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5392, "text": "So, let's zoom into that curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5393, "text": "So, we have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5394, "text": "We have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5395, "text": "This vector here I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5396, "text": "The length of this vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5397, "text": "And, the direction is essentially that of a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5398, "text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION>, that's the distance traveled divided by the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5399, "text": "That's going to be close to the speed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5400, "text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5401, "text": "So, now if I divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, I get this.", "label": []}
{"id": 5402, "text": "And, if I take the limit as <EXPRESSION> turns to <EXPRESSION>, then I get the same formula with the derivatives and with an equality.", "label": []}
{"id": 5403, "text": "It's an approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5404, "text": "The approximation becomes better and better if I go to smaller intervals.", "label": []}
{"id": 5405, "text": "OK, are there any questions about this?", "label": []}
{"id": 5406, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 5407, "text": "Yes, that's correct.", "label": []}
{"id": 5408, "text": "OK, so let's be more careful, actually.", "label": []}
{"id": 5409, "text": "So, you're asking about whether the <EXPRESSION> is actually strictly tangent to the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5410, "text": "Is that -- That's correct.", "label": []}
{"id": 5411, "text": "Actually, <EXPRESSION> is not strictly tangent to anything.", "label": []}
{"id": 5412, "text": "So, maybe I should draw another picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 5413, "text": "If I'm going from here to here, then <EXPRESSION> is going to be this arc inside the curve while the vector will be going in this direction, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5414, "text": "So, they are not strictly parallel to each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 5415, "text": "That's why it's only approximately =.", "label": []}
{"id": 5416, "text": "Similarly, this distance, the length of <EXPRESSION> is not exactly the length along the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5417, "text": "It's actually a bit shorter.", "label": []}
{"id": 5418, "text": "But, if we imagine a smaller and smaller portion of the curve, then this effect of the curve being a curve and not a straight line becomes more and more negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 5419, "text": "If you zoom into the curve sufficiently, then it looks more and more like a straight line.", "label": []}
{"id": 5420, "text": "And then, what I said becomes true in the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 5421, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5422, "text": "Any other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 5423, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 5424, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 5425, "text": "So, what happens next?", "label": []}
{"id": 5426, "text": "OK, so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because, after all, a lot of what's here you can just do in coordinates.", "label": []}
{"id": 5427, "text": "And, we don't really need vectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 5428, "text": "Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 5429, "text": "So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.", "label": []}
{"id": 5430, "text": "So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5431, "text": "So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5432, "text": "But, still I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions.", "label": []}
{"id": 5433, "text": "So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.", "label": []}
{"id": 5434, "text": "Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 5435, "text": "But maybe it's more complicated than that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5436, "text": "We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 5437, "text": "They have more and more complicated theories.", "label": []}
{"id": 5438, "text": "And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.", "label": []}
{"id": 5439, "text": "So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5440, "text": "So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5441, "text": "And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5442, "text": "Sorry, is swept at constant rate.", "label": []}
{"id": 5443, "text": "From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.", "label": []}
{"id": 5444, "text": "OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.", "label": []}
{"id": 5445, "text": "OK, so let me explain again.", "label": []}
{"id": 5446, "text": "So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.", "label": []}
{"id": 5447, "text": "Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5448, "text": "So, this is supposed to be light blue.", "label": []}
{"id": 5449, "text": "Can you see that it's different from white?", "label": []}
{"id": 5450, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 5451, "text": "OK, me neither.", "label": []}
{"id": 5452, "text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, it doesn't really matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 5453, "text": "So, the planet moves on its orbit.", "label": []}
{"id": 5454, "text": "And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 5455, "text": "Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.", "label": []}
{"id": 5456, "text": "And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.", "label": []}
{"id": 5457, "text": "So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.", "label": []}
{"id": 5458, "text": "And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5459, "text": "So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5460, "text": "And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.", "label": []}
{"id": 5461, "text": "But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.", "label": []}
{"id": 5462, "text": "So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.", "label": []}
{"id": 5463, "text": "That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.", "label": []}
{"id": 5464, "text": "So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5465, "text": "And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.", "label": []}
{"id": 5466, "text": "At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.", "label": []}
{"id": 5467, "text": "So, let's try to see, what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors?", "label": []}
{"id": 5468, "text": "OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.", "label": []}
{"id": 5469, "text": "Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5470, "text": "So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5471, "text": "OK, so let's start with the first step.", "label": []}
{"id": 5472, "text": "What's the most complicated thing in here?", "label": []}
{"id": 5473, "text": "It's this area swept out by the line.", "label": []}
{"id": 5474, "text": "How do we express that area in terms of vectors?", "label": []}
{"id": 5475, "text": "Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 5476, "text": "If I take a sufficiently small amount of time, this shaded part looks like a triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 5477, "text": "So, we have to find the area of the triangle.", "label": []}
{"id": 5478, "text": "Well, we know how to do that now.", "label": []}
{"id": 5479, "text": "So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.", "label": []}
{"id": 5480, "text": "And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 5481, "text": "OK, so, I should say, this is the area swept in time <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5482, "text": "You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.", "label": []}
{"id": 5483, "text": "I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5484, "text": "So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5485, "text": "So, let's use that.", "label": []}
{"id": 5486, "text": "Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5487, "text": "I can take out the <EXPRESSION>, which is scalar.", "label": []}
{"id": 5488, "text": "So, now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?", "label": []}
{"id": 5489, "text": "It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5490, "text": "So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5491, "text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> has constant length.", "label": []}
{"id": 5492, "text": "Any questions about that?", "label": []}
{"id": 5493, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 5494, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 5495, "text": "Yes, let me try to explain that again.", "label": []}
{"id": 5496, "text": "So, what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross products <EXPRESSION> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5497, "text": "I should say, with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept.", "label": []}
{"id": 5498, "text": "How do we see that?", "label": []}
{"id": 5499, "text": "Well, let's take a small time interval, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5500, "text": "In time, <EXPRESSION>, our planet moves by <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5501, "text": "So, if it moves by <EXPRESSION>, it means that this triangle up there has two sides.", "label": []}
{"id": 5502, "text": "One is the position vector, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5503, "text": "The other one is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5504, "text": "So, its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 5505, "text": "That's the formula we've seen for the area of a triangle in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 5506, "text": "So, the area is one half of the cross product, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, magnitude of the cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 5507, "text": "So, to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional.", "label": []}
{"id": 5508, "text": "Area divided by <EXPRESSION> is constant at our time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5509, "text": "And so, this is constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 5510, "text": "OK, now, what about the other half of the law?", "label": []}
{"id": 5511, "text": "Well, it says that the motion is in a plane, and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place.", "label": []}
{"id": 5512, "text": "And, it contains, also, the sun.", "label": []}
{"id": 5513, "text": "And, it contains the trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 5514, "text": "So, let's think about that plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5515, "text": "Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5516, "text": "OK, that's what we are saying.", "label": []}
{"id": 5517, "text": "But, there is another vector that I know it is in the plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5518, "text": "You could say the position vector at another time, or at any time, but in fact, what's also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5519, "text": "OK, if I'm moving in the plane, then position and velocity are in there.", "label": []}
{"id": 5520, "text": "So, the plane of motion contains <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5521, "text": "So, what's the direction of the cross product <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 5522, "text": "Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5523, "text": "So, it's normal to the plane of motion.", "label": []}
{"id": 5524, "text": "And, that means, now, that actually we've put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <EXPRESSION> has constant length and constant direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5525, "text": "In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.", "label": []}
{"id": 5526, "text": "So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5527, "text": "And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5528, "text": "If you want, it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5529, "text": "Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.", "label": []}
{"id": 5530, "text": "It's, however, instant, if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time.", "label": []}
{"id": 5531, "text": "And, to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 5532, "text": "OK, so -- [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] OK, so, Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that <EQUATION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5533, "text": "That's what the law says.", "label": []}
{"id": 5534, "text": "So, in terms of derivatives, it means <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5535, "text": "OK, now, so there's an interesting thing to note, which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions, with dot products or cross products.", "label": []}
{"id": 5536, "text": "There's only one catch, which is that when we differentiate a cross product, we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left.", "label": []}
{"id": 5537, "text": "The guy on the right stays on the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 5538, "text": "OK, so, if you know that <EXPRESSION>, then you are safe.", "label": []}
{"id": 5539, "text": "If you know it as <EXPRESSION>, then you are not safe.", "label": []}
{"id": 5540, "text": "OK, so it's the only thing to watch for.", "label": []}
{"id": 5541, "text": "So, product rule is OK for taking the derivative of a dot product.", "label": []}
{"id": 5542, "text": "There, you don't actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product.", "label": []}
{"id": 5543, "text": "There you just need to be a little bit more careful.", "label": []}
{"id": 5544, "text": "OK, so, now that we know that, we can write this as <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5545, "text": "Well, let's reformulate things slightly.", "label": []}
{"id": 5546, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> already has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 5547, "text": "In fact, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5548, "text": "OK, that's what we call the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5549, "text": "So, this is <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 5550, "text": "That's the acceleration, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5551, "text": "OK, so now what's the next step?", "label": []}
{"id": 5552, "text": "Well, we know what <EXPRESSION> is because, remember, a vector cross itself is always <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 5553, "text": "So, this is the same <EQUATION>, and that's the same as saying that the cross product of two vectors is <EXPRESSION> exactly when the parallelogram of the form has no area.", "label": []}
{"id": 5554, "text": "And, the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 5555, "text": "So, that means the acceleration is parallel to the position.", "label": []}
{"id": 5556, "text": "OK, so, in fact, what Kepler's second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5557, "text": "And, since we know that acceleration is caused by a force that's equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force -- -- is parallel to the position vector, that means, well, if you have the sun here at the origin, and if you have your planets, well, the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line.", "label": []}
{"id": 5558, "text": "In fact, the law doesn't even say whether it's going towards the sun or away from the sun.", "label": []}
{"id": 5559, "text": "Well, what we know now is that, of course, the attraction is towards the sun.", "label": []}
{"id": 5560, "text": "But, Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were going away.", "label": []}
{"id": 5561, "text": "So, in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge.", "label": []}
{"id": 5562, "text": "So, actually, if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field caused by a point charged particle, it also satisfies Kepler's law, satisfies the same law.", "label": []}
{"id": 5563, "text": "OK, that's the end for today, thanks.", "label": []}
{"id": 5947, "text": "so -- OK, so remember last time, on Tuesday we learned about the chain rule, and so for example we saw that if we have a function that depends, sorry, on three variables, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> themselves depend on some variable, <EXPRESSION>, then you can find a formula for <EXPRESSION> by writing down <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5948, "text": "And, the meaning of that formula is that while the change in <EXPRESSION> is caused by changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> change at rates <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5949, "text": "And, this causes a function to change accordingly using, well, the partial derivatives tell you how sensitive <EXPRESSION> is to changes in each variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 5950, "text": "OK, so, we are going to just rewrite this in a new notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5951, "text": "So, I'm going to rewrite this in a more concise form as gradient of <EXPRESSION> dot product with velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5952, "text": "So, the gradient of <EXPRESSION> is a vector formed by putting together all of the partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 5953, "text": "OK, so it's the vector whose components are the partials.", "label": []}
{"id": 5954, "text": "And, of course, it's a vector that depends on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 5955, "text": "These guys depend on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5956, "text": "So, it's actually one vector for each point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5957, "text": "You can talk about the gradient of <EXPRESSION> at some point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5958, "text": "So, at each point, it gives you a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5959, "text": "That actually is what we will call later a vector field.", "label": []}
{"id": 5960, "text": "We'll get back to that later.", "label": []}
{"id": 5961, "text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is just the velocity vector <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5962, "text": "OK, so the new definition for today is the definition of the gradient vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5963, "text": "And, our goal will be to understand a bit better, what does this vector mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 5964, "text": "What does it measure?", "label": []}
{"id": 5965, "text": "And, what can we do with it?", "label": []}
{"id": 5966, "text": "But, you see that in terms of information content, it's really the same information that's already in the partial derivatives, or in the differential.", "label": []}
{"id": 5967, "text": "So, yes, and I should say, of course you can also use the gradient and other things like approximation formulas and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 5968, "text": "And so far, it's just notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 5969, "text": "It's a way to rewrite things.", "label": []}
{"id": 5970, "text": "But, so here's the first cool property of the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 5971, "text": "So, I claim that the gradient vector is perpendicular to the level surface corresponding to setting the function, <EXPRESSION>, = a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 5972, "text": "OK, so if I draw a contour plot of my function, so, actually forget about <EXPRESSION> because I want to draw a two variable contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 5973, "text": "So, say I have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then maybe it has some contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 5974, "text": "And, I'm saying if I take the gradient of a function at this point, (x, y).", "label": []}
{"id": 5975, "text": "So, I will have a vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 5976, "text": "Well, if I draw that vector on top of a contour plot, it's going to end up being perpendicular to the level curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 5977, "text": "Same thing if I have a function of three variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 5978, "text": "Then, I can try to draw its contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 5979, "text": "Of course, I can't really do it because the contour plot would be living in space with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5980, "text": "But, it would be a bunch of level faces, and the gradient vector would be a vector in space.", "label": []}
{"id": 5981, "text": "That vector is perpendicular to the level faces.", "label": []}
{"id": 5982, "text": "So, let's try to see that on a couple of examples.", "label": []}
{"id": 5983, "text": "So, let's do a first example.", "label": []}
{"id": 5984, "text": "What's the easiest case?", "label": []}
{"id": 5985, "text": "Let's take a linear function of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5986, "text": "So, I will take <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5987, "text": "Well, so, what's the gradient of this function?", "label": []}
{"id": 5988, "text": "Well, the first component will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5989, "text": "That's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5990, "text": "Then, <EXPRESSION>, that's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5991, "text": "Now, what is the levels of this?", "label": []}
{"id": 5992, "text": "Well, if I set <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>, that means I look at the points where <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 5993, "text": "What kind of service is that?", "label": []}
{"id": 5994, "text": "It's a plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 5995, "text": "And, we know how to find a normal vector to this plane just by looking at the coefficients.", "label": []}
{"id": 5996, "text": "So, it's a plane with a normal vector exactly this gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 5997, "text": "And, in fact, in a way, this is the only case you need to check because of linear approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 5998, "text": "If you replace a function by its linear approximation, that means you will replace the level surfaces by their tension planes.", "label": []}
{"id": 5999, "text": "And then, you'll actually end up in this situation.", "label": []}
{"id": 6000, "text": "But maybe that's not very convincing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6001, "text": "So, let's do another example.", "label": []}
{"id": 6002, "text": "So, let's do a second example.", "label": []}
{"id": 6003, "text": "Let's say we look at the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6004, "text": "OK, so now it's a function of just two variables because that way we'll be able to actually draw a picture for you.", "label": []}
{"id": 6005, "text": "OK, so what are the level sets of this function?", "label": []}
{"id": 6006, "text": "Well, they're going to be circles, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 6007, "text": "<EQUATION> is a circle, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6008, "text": "So, I should say, maybe, sorry, the level curve is a circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 6009, "text": "So, the contour plot looks something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6010, "text": "Now, what's the gradient vector?", "label": []}
{"id": 6011, "text": "Well, the gradient of this function, so, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6012, "text": "And partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6013, "text": "So, let's say I take a point, <EXPRESSION>, and I try to draw my gradient vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 6014, "text": "So, here at <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so, I have to draw the vector, &<EXPRESSION>;<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>&<EXPRESSION>;.", "label": []}
{"id": 6015, "text": "What does it look like?", "label": []}
{"id": 6016, "text": "Well, it's going in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6017, "text": "It's parallel to the position vector for this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6018, "text": "It's actually twice the position vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 6019, "text": "So, I guess it goes more or less like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6020, "text": "What's interesting, too, is it is perpendicular to this circle.", "label": []}
{"id": 6021, "text": "OK, so it's a general feature.", "label": []}
{"id": 6022, "text": "Actually, let me show you more examples, oops, not the one I want.", "label": []}
{"id": 6023, "text": "So, I don't know if you can see it so well.", "label": []}
{"id": 6024, "text": "Well, hopefully you can.", "label": []}
{"id": 6025, "text": "So, here I have a contour plot of a function, and I have a blue vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 6026, "text": "That's the gradient vector at the pink point on the plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 6027, "text": "So, you can see, I can move the pink point, and the gradient vector, of course, changes because the gradient depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6028, "text": "But, what doesn't change is that it's always perpendicular to the level curves.", "label": []}
{"id": 6029, "text": "Anywhere I am, my gradient stays perpendicular to the level curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 6030, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "label": []}
{"id": 6031, "text": "Is that visible for people who can't see blue?", "label": []}
{"id": 6032, "text": "OK, so, OK, so we have a lot of evidence, but let's try to prove the theorem because it will be interesting.", "label": []}
{"id": 6033, "text": "So, first of all, sorry, any questions about the statement, the example, anything, yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6034, "text": "Ah, very good question.", "label": []}
{"id": 6035, "text": "Does the gradient vector, why is the gradient vector perpendicular in one direction rather than the other?", "label": []}
{"id": 6036, "text": "So, we'll see the answer to that in a few minutes.", "label": []}
{"id": 6037, "text": "But let me just tell you immediately, to the side, which side it's pointing to, it's always pointing towards higher values of a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 6038, "text": "OK, and we'll see in that maybe about half an hour.", "label": []}
{"id": 6039, "text": "So, well, let me say actually points towards higher values of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6040, "text": "OK, any other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 6041, "text": "I don't see any questions.", "label": []}
{"id": 6042, "text": "OK, so let's try to prove this theorem, at least this part of the theorem.", "label": []}
{"id": 6043, "text": "We're not going to prove that just yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 6044, "text": "That will come in a while.", "label": []}
{"id": 6045, "text": "So, well, maybe we want to understand first what happens if we move inside the level curve, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6046, "text": "So, let's imagine that we are taking a moving point that stays on the level curve or on the level surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6047, "text": "And then, we know, well, what happens is that the function stays constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 6048, "text": "But, we can also know how quickly the function changes using the chain rule up there.", "label": []}
{"id": 6049, "text": "So, maybe the chain rule will actually be the key to understanding how the gradient vector and the motion on the level service relate.", "label": []}
{"id": 6050, "text": "So, let's take a curve, <EQUATION>, that stays inside, well, maybe I should say on the level surface, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6051, "text": "So, let's think about what that means.", "label": []}
{"id": 6052, "text": "So, just to get you used to this idea, I'm going to draw a level surface of a function of three variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 6053, "text": "OK, so it's a surface given by the equation <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6054, "text": "And, so now I'm going to have a point on that, and it's going to move on that surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6055, "text": "So, I will have some parametric curve that lives on this surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6056, "text": "So, the question is, what's going to happen at any given time?", "label": []}
{"id": 6057, "text": "Well, the first observation is that the velocity vector, what can I say about the velocity vector of this motion?", "label": []}
{"id": 6058, "text": "It's going to be tangent to the level surface, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 6059, "text": "If I move on a surface, then at any point, my velocity is tangent to the curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 6060, "text": "But, if it's tangent to the curve, then it's also tangent to the surface because the curve is inside the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6061, "text": "So, OK, it's getting a bit cluttered.", "label": []}
{"id": 6062, "text": "Maybe I should draw a bigger picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 6063, "text": "Let me do that right away here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6064, "text": "So, I have my level surface, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6065, "text": "I have a curve on that, and at some point, I'm going to have a certain velocity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6066, "text": "So, the claim is that the velocity, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> is tangent -- -- to the level, <EQUATION> because it's tangent to the curve, and the curve is inside the level, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6067, "text": "Now, what else can we say?", "label": []}
{"id": 6068, "text": "Well, we have, the chain rule will tell us how the value of <EXPRESSION> changes.", "label": []}
{"id": 6069, "text": "So, by the chain rule, we have <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6070, "text": "So, the rate of change of the value of <EXPRESSION> as I move along this curve is given by the dot product between the gradient and the velocity vector.", "label": []}
{"id": 6071, "text": "And, so, well, maybe I can rewrite it as <EXPRESSION>, and that should be, well, what should it be?", "label": []}
{"id": 6072, "text": "What happens to the value of <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> changes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6073, "text": "Well, it stays constant because we are moving on a curve.", "label": []}
{"id": 6074, "text": "That curve might be complicated, but it stays always on the level, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6075, "text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> because <EQUATION>, which is a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 6076, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "label": []}
{"id": 6077, "text": "OK, so now if we have a dot product that's <EXPRESSION>, that tells us that these two guys are perpendicular.", "label": []}
{"id": 6078, "text": "So -- So if the gradient vector is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>, OK, that's a good start.", "label": []}
{"id": 6079, "text": "We know that the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent that's tangent to the level surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6080, "text": "What about other vectors tangent to the level surface?", "label": []}
{"id": 6081, "text": "Well, in fact, I could use any curve drawn on the level of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6082, "text": "So, I could move, really, any way I wanted on that surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6083, "text": "In particular, I claim that I could have chosen my velocity vector to be any vector tangent to the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6084, "text": "OK, so let's write this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6085, "text": "So this is true for any curve, or, I'll say for any motion on the level surface, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6086, "text": "So that means <EXPRESSION> can be any vector tangent to the surface tangent to the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6087, "text": "See, for example, OK, let me draw one more picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 6088, "text": "OK, so I have my level surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6089, "text": "So, I'm drawing more and more levels, and they never quite look the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 6090, "text": "But I have a point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6091, "text": "And, at this point, I have the tangent plane to the level surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6092, "text": "OK, so this is tangent plane to the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6093, "text": "Then, if I choose any vector in that tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6094, "text": "Let's say I choose the one that goes in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6095, "text": "Then, I can actually find a curve that goes in that direction, and stays on the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6096, "text": "So, here, that would be a curve that somehow goes from the right to the left, and of course it has to end up going up or something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6097, "text": "OK, so given any vector tangent -- -- let's call that vector <EXPRESSION> tangent to the level, we get that the gradient is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6098, "text": "So, if the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent to this curve, but also to any vector, I can draw that tangent to my surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6099, "text": "So, what does that mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 6100, "text": "Well, that means the gradient is actually perpendicular to the tangent plane or to the surface at this point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6101, "text": "So, the gradient is perpendicular.", "label": []}
{"id": 6102, "text": "And, well, here, I've illustrated things with a three-dimensional example, but really it works the same if you have only two variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 6103, "text": "Then you have a level curve that has a tangent line, and the gradient is perpendicular to that line.", "label": []}
{"id": 6104, "text": "OK, any questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 6105, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 6106, "text": "OK, so, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 6107, "text": "That's actually pretty neat because there is a nice application of this, which is to try to figure out, now we know, actually, how to find the tangent plane to anything, pretty much.", "label": []}
{"id": 6108, "text": "OK, so let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 6109, "text": "So, let's say that, for example, I want to find -- -- the tangent plane -- -- to the surface with equation, let's say, <EQUATION> at the point (2, 1, 1).", "label": []}
{"id": 6110, "text": "Let me write that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6111, "text": "So, how do we do that?", "label": []}
{"id": 6112, "text": "Well, one way that we already know, if we solve this for <EXPRESSION>, so we can write <EQUATION>, then we know tangent plane approximation for the graph of a function, <EXPRESSION> = some function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6113, "text": "But, that doesn't look like it's the best way to do it.", "label": []}
{"id": 6114, "text": "OK, the best way to it, now that we have the gradient vector, is actually to directly say, oh, we know the normal vector to this plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6115, "text": "The normal vector will just be the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6116, "text": "Oh, I think I have a cool picture to show.", "label": []}
{"id": 6117, "text": "OK, so that's what it looks like.", "label": []}
{"id": 6118, "text": "OK, so here you have the surface <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6119, "text": "That's called a hyperboloid because it looks like when you get when you spin a hyperbola around an axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 6120, "text": "And, here's a tangent plane at the given point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6121, "text": "So, it doesn't look very tangent because it crosses the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6122, "text": "But, it's really, if you think about it, you will see it's really the plane that's approximating the surface in the best way that you can at this given point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6123, "text": "It is really the tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6124, "text": "So, how do we find this plane?", "label": []}
{"id": 6125, "text": "Well, you can plot it on a computer.", "label": []}
{"id": 6126, "text": "That's not exactly how you would look for it in the first place.", "label": []}
{"id": 6127, "text": "So, the way to do it is that we compute the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6128, "text": "So, a gradient of what?", "label": []}
{"id": 6129, "text": "Well, a gradient of this function.", "label": []}
{"id": 6130, "text": "OK, so I should say, this is the level set, <EQUATION>, where <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6131, "text": "And so, we know that the gradient of this, well, what is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 6132, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6133, "text": "So, at this given point, I guess we are at <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6134, "text": "So, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6135, "text": "And then, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6136, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6137, "text": "OK, and that's going to be the normal vector to the surface or to the tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6138, "text": "That's one way to define the tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6139, "text": "All right, it has the same normal vector as the surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6140, "text": "That's one way to define the normal vector to the surface, if you prefer.", "label": []}
{"id": 6141, "text": "Being perpendicular to the surface means that you are perpendicular to its tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6142, "text": "OK, so the equation is, well, <EXPRESSION> = something, where something is, well, we should just plug in that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6143, "text": "We'll get <EXPRESSION> looks like we'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6144, "text": "And, of course, we could simplify dividing everything by two, but it's not very important here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6145, "text": "OK, so now if you have a surface given by an evil equation, and a point on the surface, well, you know how to find the tangent plane to the surface at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6146, "text": "OK, any questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 6147, "text": "No.", "label": []}
{"id": 6148, "text": "OK, let me give just another reason why, another way that we could have seen this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6149, "text": "So, I claim, in fact, we could have done this without the gradient, or using the gradient in a somehow disguised way.", "label": []}
{"id": 6150, "text": "So, here's another way.", "label": []}
{"id": 6151, "text": "So, the other way to do it would be to start with a differential, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6152, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, while it's pretty much the same content, but let me write it as a differential, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6153, "text": "So, at a given point, at (2, 1, 1), this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6154, "text": "Now, if we want to change this into an approximation formula, we can.", "label": []}
{"id": 6155, "text": "We know that the change in <EXPRESSION> is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6156, "text": "OK, so when do we stay on the level surface?", "label": []}
{"id": 6157, "text": "Well, we stay on the level surface when <EXPRESSION> doesn't change, so, when this becomes <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6158, "text": "Now, what does this approximation sign mean?", "label": []}
{"id": 6159, "text": "Well, it means for small changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, this guy will be close to that guy.", "label": []}
{"id": 6160, "text": "It also means something else.", "label": []}
{"id": 6161, "text": "Remember, these approximation formulas, they are linear approximations.", "label": []}
{"id": 6162, "text": "They mean that we replace the function, actually, by some closest linear formula that will be nearby.", "label": []}
{"id": 6163, "text": "And so, in particular, if we set this = <EXPRESSION> instead of approximately <EXPRESSION>, it means we'll actually be moving on the tangent plane to the level set.", "label": []}
{"id": 6164, "text": "If you want strict equalities in approximations means that we replace the function by its tangent approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 6165, "text": "So -- [APPLAUSE] OK, so the level corresponds to <EQUATION> and its tangent plane corresponds to <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6166, "text": "That's what I'm trying to say, basically.", "label": []}
{"id": 6167, "text": "And, what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 6168, "text": "Well, that means it's the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6169, "text": "So, what's the change in <EXPRESSION> here?", "label": []}
{"id": 6170, "text": "That means, well, we started with <EQUATION>, and we moved to some other value, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6171, "text": "So, that's actually <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 6172, "text": "That's how much <EXPRESSION> has changed compared to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6173, "text": "And, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6174, "text": "That's the equation of a tangent plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6175, "text": "It's the same equation as the one over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 6176, "text": "These are just two different methods to get it.", "label": []}
{"id": 6177, "text": "OK, so this one explains to you what's going on in terms of approximation formulas.", "label": []}
{"id": 6178, "text": "This one goes right away, by using the gradient factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 6179, "text": "So, in a way, with this one, you don't have to think nearly as much.", "label": []}
{"id": 6180, "text": "But, you can use either one.", "label": []}
{"id": 6181, "text": "OK, questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 6182, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 6183, "text": "OK, so let's move on to new topic, which is another application of a gradient vector, and that is directional derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 6184, "text": "OK, so let's say that we have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6185, "text": "Well, we know how to compute partial <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, which measure how <EXPRESSION> changes if I move in the direction of the x axis or in the direction of the y axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 6186, "text": "So, what about moving in other directions?", "label": []}
{"id": 6187, "text": "Well, of course, we've seen other approximation formulas and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 6188, "text": "But, we can still ask, is there a derivative in every direction?", "label": []}
{"id": 6189, "text": "And that's basically, yes, that's the directional derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6190, "text": "OK, so these are derivatives in the direction of I hat or j hat, the vectors that go along the x or the y axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 6191, "text": "So, what if we move in another direction, let's say, the direction of some unit vector, let's call it u.", "label": []}
{"id": 6192, "text": "OK, so if I give you a unit vector, you can ask yourself, if I move in the direction, how quickly will my function change?", "label": []}
{"id": 6193, "text": "So -- So, let's look at the straight trajectory.", "label": []}
{"id": 6194, "text": "What this should mean is I start at some value, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and there I have my vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6195, "text": "And, I'm going to move in a straight line in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6196, "text": "And, I have the graph of my function -- -- and I'm asking myself how quickly does the value change when I move on the graph in that direction?", "label": []}
{"id": 6197, "text": "OK, so let's look at a straight line trajectory So, we have a position vector, <EXPRESSION>, that will depend on some parameter which I will call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6198, "text": "You'll see why very soon, in such a way that the derivative is this given unit vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6199, "text": "So, why do I use s for my parameter rather than <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6200, "text": "Well, it's a convention.", "label": []}
{"id": 6201, "text": "I'm moving at unit speed along this line.", "label": []}
{"id": 6202, "text": "So that means that actually, I'm parameterizing things by the distance that I've traveled along a curve, sorry, along this line.", "label": []}
{"id": 6203, "text": "So, here it's called s in the sense of arc length.", "label": []}
{"id": 6204, "text": "Actually, it's not really an arc because it's a straight line, so it's the distance along the line.", "label": []}
{"id": 6205, "text": "OK, so because we are parameterizing by distance, we are just using s as a convention just to distinguish it from other situations.", "label": []}
{"id": 6206, "text": "And, so, now, the question will be, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 6207, "text": "What's the rate of change of w when I move like that?", "label": []}
{"id": 6208, "text": "Well, of course we know the answer because that's a special case of the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 6209, "text": "So, that's how we will actually compute it.", "label": []}
{"id": 6210, "text": "But, in terms of what it means, it really means we are asking ourselves, we start at a point and we change the variables in a certain direction, which is not necessarily the x or the y direction, but really any direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6211, "text": "And then, what's the derivative in that direction?", "label": []}
{"id": 6212, "text": "OK, does that make sense as a concept?", "label": []}
{"id": 6213, "text": "Kind of?", "label": []}
{"id": 6214, "text": "I see some faces that are not completely convinced.", "label": []}
{"id": 6215, "text": "So, maybe you should show more pictures.", "label": []}
{"id": 6216, "text": "Well, let me first write down a bit more and show you something.", "label": []}
{"id": 6217, "text": "So I just want to give you the actual definition.", "label": []}
{"id": 6218, "text": "Sorry, first of all in case you wonder what this is all about, so let's say the components of our unit vector are two numbers, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6219, "text": "Then, it means we'll move along the line <EXPRESSION> = some initial value, the point where we are actually at the directional derivative <EXPRESSION>, or I meant to say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6220, "text": "And, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6221, "text": "And then, we plug that into <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6222, "text": "And then we take the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6223, "text": "So, we have a notation for that which is going to be <EXPRESSION> with a subscript in the direction of u to indicate in which direction we are actually going to move.", "label": []}
{"id": 6224, "text": "And, that's called the directional derivative -- -- in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6225, "text": "OK, so, let's see what it means geometrically.", "label": []}
{"id": 6226, "text": "So, remember, we've seen things about partial derivatives, and we see that the partial derivatives are the slopes of slices of the graph by vertical planes that are parallel to the x or the y directions.", "label": []}
{"id": 6227, "text": "OK, so, if I have a point, at any point, I can slice the graph of my function by two planes, one that's going along the x, one along the y direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6228, "text": "And then, I can look at the slices of the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 6229, "text": "Let me see if I can use that thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6230, "text": "So, we can look at the slices of the graph that are drawn here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6231, "text": "In fact, we look at the tangent lines to the slices, and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6232, "text": "So, now, similarly, the directional derivative means, actually, we'll be slicing our graph by the vertical plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6233, "text": "It's not really colorful, something more colorful.", "label": []}
{"id": 6234, "text": "We'll be slicing things by a plane that is now in the direction of this vector, <EXPRESSION>, and we'll be looking at the slope of the slice of the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 6235, "text": "So, what that looks like here, so that's the same applet the way that you've used on your problem set in case you are wondering.", "label": []}
{"id": 6236, "text": "So, now, I'm picking a point on the contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 6237, "text": "And, at that point, I slice the graph.", "label": []}
{"id": 6238, "text": "So, here I'm starting by slicing in the direction of the x axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 6239, "text": "So, in fact, what I'm measuring here by the slope of the slice is the partial in the x direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6240, "text": "It's really <EXPRESSION>, which is also the directional derivative in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6241, "text": "And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have all of these planes.", "label": []}
{"id": 6242, "text": "So, you see at the bottom left, I have the direction in which I'm going.", "label": []}
{"id": 6243, "text": "There's this, like, rotating line that tells you in which direction I'm going to be moving.", "label": []}
{"id": 6244, "text": "And for each direction, I have a plane.", "label": []}
{"id": 6245, "text": "And, when I slice by that plane, I will get, so I have this direction here going maybe to the southwest.", "label": []}
{"id": 6246, "text": "So, that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane, and the slice has a certain slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 6247, "text": "And, the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6248, "text": "OK, I think that's as graphic as I can get.", "label": []}
{"id": 6249, "text": "OK, any questions about that?", "label": []}
{"id": 6250, "text": "No?", "label": []}
{"id": 6251, "text": "OK, so let's see how we compute that guy.", "label": []}
{"id": 6252, "text": "So, let me just write again just in case you want to, in case you didn't hear me it's the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane -- -- that contains the given direction, that's parallel to the direction, u.", "label": []}
{"id": 6253, "text": "So, how do we compute it?", "label": []}
{"id": 6254, "text": "Well, we can use the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 6255, "text": "The chain rule implies that <EXPRESSION> is actually the gradient of w dot product with the velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6256, "text": "But, remember we say that we are going to be moving at unit speed in the direction of u.", "label": []}
{"id": 6257, "text": "So, in fact, that's just gradient <EXPRESSION> dot product with the unit vector <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6258, "text": "OK, so the formula that we remember is really <EXPRESSION> in the direction of u is gradient <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6259, "text": "And, maybe I should also say in words, this is the component of the gradient in the direction of u.", "label": []}
{"id": 6260, "text": "And, maybe that makes more sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 6261, "text": "So, for example, the directional derivative in the direction of I hat is the component along the x axes.", "label": []}
{"id": 6262, "text": "That's the same as, indeed, the partial derivatives in the x direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6263, "text": "Things make sense.", "label": []}
{"id": 6264, "text": "dw/ds in the direction of I hat is, sorry, gradient <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, maybe I should write, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6265, "text": "OK, now, so that's basically what we need to know to compute these guys.", "label": []}
{"id": 6266, "text": "So now, let's go back to the gradient and see what this tells us about the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6267, "text": "[APPLAUSE] I see you guys are having fun.", "label": []}
{"id": 6268, "text": "OK, OK, let's do a little bit of geometry here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6269, "text": "That should calm you down.", "label": []}
{"id": 6270, "text": "So, we said <EXPRESSION> in the direction of <EXPRESSION> is gradient <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6271, "text": "That's the same as the length of gradient <EXPRESSION> times the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6272, "text": "Well, that happens to be one because we are taking the unit vector times the cosine of the angle between the gradient and the given unit vector, <EXPRESSION>, so, have this angle, theta.", "label": []}
{"id": 6273, "text": "OK, that's another way of saying we are taking the component of a gradient in the direction of u.", "label": []}
{"id": 6274, "text": "But now, what does that tell us?", "label": []}
{"id": 6275, "text": "Well, let's try to figure out in which directions w changes the fastest, in which direction it increases the most or decreases the most, or doesn't actually change.", "label": []}
{"id": 6276, "text": "So, when is this going to be the largest?", "label": []}
{"id": 6277, "text": "If I fix a point, if I set a point, then the gradient vector at that point is given to me.", "label": []}
{"id": 6278, "text": "But, the question is, in which direction does it change the most quickly?", "label": []}
{"id": 6279, "text": "Well, what I can change is the direction, and this will be the largest when the cosine is one.", "label": []}
{"id": 6280, "text": "So, this is largest when the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6281, "text": "That means the angle is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6282, "text": "That means u is actually in the direction of the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6283, "text": "OK, so that's a new way to think about the direction of a gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6284, "text": "The gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6285, "text": "So, the direction of gradient <EXPRESSION> is the direction of fastest increase of <EXPRESSION> at the given point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6286, "text": "And, what is the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 6287, "text": "Well, it's actually the directional derivative in that direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6288, "text": "OK, so if I go in that direction, which gives me the fastest increase, then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6289, "text": "And, with the direction of the fastest decrease?", "label": []}
{"id": 6290, "text": "It's going in the opposite direction, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 6291, "text": "I mean, if you are on a mountain, and you know that you are facing the mountain, that's the direction of fastest increase.", "label": []}
{"id": 6292, "text": "The direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down.", "label": []}
{"id": 6293, "text": "OK, so, the minimal value of <EXPRESSION> is achieved when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6294, "text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6295, "text": "That means <EXPRESSION> is in the direction of minus the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6296, "text": "It points opposite to the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6297, "text": "And, finally, when do we have <EQUATION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 6298, "text": "So, in which direction does the function not change?", "label": []}
{"id": 6299, "text": "Well, we have two answers to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6300, "text": "One is to just use the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 6301, "text": "So, that's <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6302, "text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6303, "text": "That means that <EXPRESSION> is perpendicular to the gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6304, "text": "The other way to think about it, the direction in which the value doesn't change is a direction that's tangent to the level surface.", "label": []}
{"id": 6305, "text": "If we are not changing a, it means we are moving along the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6306, "text": "And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6307, "text": "So, let me just show that on the picture here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6308, "text": "So, if actually show you the gradient, you can't really see it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6309, "text": "I need to move it a bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 6310, "text": "So, the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that I have chosen.", "label": []}
{"id": 6311, "text": "Now, if I choose a slice that's perpendicular, and a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient, so that's actually tangent to the level curve, then you see that my slice is flat.", "label": []}
{"id": 6312, "text": "I don't actually have any slop.", "label": []}
{"id": 6313, "text": "The directional derivative in a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient is basically <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6314, "text": "Now, if I rotate, then the slope sort of increases, increases, increases, and it becomes the largest when I'm going in the direction of a gradient.", "label": []}
{"id": 6315, "text": "So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.", "label": []}
{"id": 6316, "text": "And now, if I keep rotating, then the slope will decrease again.", "label": []}
{"id": 6317, "text": "Then it becomes <EXPRESSION> when I perpendicular, and then it becomes negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6318, "text": "It's the most negative when I pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <EXPRESSION> again when I'm back perpendicular.", "label": []}
{"id": 6319, "text": "OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.", "label": []}
{"id": 6320, "text": "The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.", "label": []}
{"id": 6321, "text": "And, it would be going towards higher values of a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 6322, "text": "I don't know if you can see the labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6323, "text": "So, it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction.", "label": []}
{"id": 6324, "text": "OK, so that's it for today.", "label": []}
{"id": 6756, "text": "So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6757, "text": "So, that's the main topic for today.", "label": []}
{"id": 6758, "text": "So, remember yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of several variables.", "label": []}
{"id": 6759, "text": "And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6760, "text": "That's a point where the partial derivatives are both <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6761, "text": "And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.", "label": []}
{"id": 6762, "text": "There's local minima.", "label": []}
{"id": 6763, "text": "So, maybe I should show the function on this contour plot, there is local maxima, which are like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6764, "text": "And, there's saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima.", "label": []}
{"id": 6765, "text": "And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.", "label": []}
{"id": 6766, "text": "It will have several critical points.", "label": []}
{"id": 6767, "text": "So, this example here, well, you see on the plot that there is two maxima.", "label": []}
{"id": 6768, "text": "And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6769, "text": "And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.", "label": []}
{"id": 6770, "text": "On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6771, "text": "And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.", "label": []}
{"id": 6772, "text": "It crosses itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 6773, "text": "And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.", "label": []}
{"id": 6774, "text": "Along the x direction, the values will increase.", "label": []}
{"id": 6775, "text": "So, you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots.", "label": []}
{"id": 6776, "text": "So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 6777, "text": "Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.", "label": []}
{"id": 6778, "text": "So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?", "label": []}
{"id": 6779, "text": "So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6780, "text": "So, and, in fact, why do we care?", "label": []}
{"id": 6781, "text": "Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a function?", "label": []}
{"id": 6782, "text": "So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.", "label": []}
{"id": 6783, "text": "For example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function?", "label": []}
{"id": 6784, "text": "Well, we have two obvious candidates.", "label": []}
{"id": 6785, "text": "We have this local maximum and that local maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6786, "text": "And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?", "label": []}
{"id": 6787, "text": "Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6788, "text": "But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.", "label": []}
{"id": 6789, "text": "Well, four wins.", "label": []}
{"id": 6790, "text": "The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.", "label": []}
{"id": 6791, "text": "So, where's the minimum?", "label": []}
{"id": 6792, "text": "Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6793, "text": "So, that's another feature.", "label": []}
{"id": 6794, "text": "The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6795, "text": "It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6796, "text": "So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.", "label": []}
{"id": 6797, "text": "So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6798, "text": "So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.", "label": []}
{"id": 6799, "text": "And so, we have to try both.", "label": []}
{"id": 6800, "text": "OK, but so we'll get back to that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6801, "text": "For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?", "label": []}
{"id": 6802, "text": "So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.", "label": []}
{"id": 6803, "text": "And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 6804, "text": "If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6805, "text": "And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.", "label": []}
{"id": 6806, "text": "And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 6807, "text": "So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.", "label": []}
{"id": 6808, "text": "But, it will again involve the second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6809, "text": "OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method.", "label": []}
{"id": 6810, "text": "OK, so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function that's actually just quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 6811, "text": "So, let's say I have a function, <EXPRESSION> that's of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6812, "text": "OK, so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well, and if you plug <EQUATION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6813, "text": "You can also see, if you try to do a linear approximation of this, well, all these guys are much smaller than <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are small.", "label": []}
{"id": 6814, "text": "So, the linear approximation, the tangent plane to the graph is really just <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6815, "text": "OK, so, how do we do it?", "label": []}
{"id": 6816, "text": "Well, yesterday we actually did an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 6817, "text": "It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it, so remember, we were looking at something that started with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6818, "text": "And, there were other terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 6819, "text": "But, let's forget them now.", "label": []}
{"id": 6820, "text": "And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6821, "text": "And now, this is a sum of two squares.", "label": []}
{"id": 6822, "text": "So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6823, "text": "And so, the origin will be a minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6824, "text": "Well, it turns out we can do something similar in general no matter what the values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are.", "label": []}
{"id": 6825, "text": "We'll just try to first complete things to a square.", "label": []}
{"id": 6826, "text": "OK, so let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6827, "text": "So, in general, well, let me be slightly less general, and let me assume that a is not zero because otherwise I can't do what I'm going to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 6828, "text": "So, I'm going to write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6829, "text": "And then I have my <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6830, "text": "And now this looks like the beginning of the square of something, OK, just like what we did over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 6831, "text": "So, what is it the square of?", "label": []}
{"id": 6832, "text": "Well, you'd start with <EXPRESSION> plus I claim if I put <EXPRESSION> and I square it, then see the cross term <EXPRESSION> will become <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6833, "text": "Of course, now I also get some y squares out of this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6834, "text": "How many y squares do I get?", "label": []}
{"id": 6835, "text": "Well, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6836, "text": "So, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6837, "text": "So, and I want, in fact, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6838, "text": "So, the number of <EXPRESSION> that I should add is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6839, "text": "OK, let's see that again.", "label": []}
{"id": 6840, "text": "If I expand this thing, I will get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6841, "text": "That's going to be my <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6842, "text": "But, I also get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6843, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6844, "text": "And, that cancels out with this guy here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6845, "text": "And then, I will be left with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6846, "text": "OK, do you see it kind of?", "label": []}
{"id": 6847, "text": "OK, if not, well, try expanding this square again.", "label": []}
{"id": 6848, "text": "OK, maybe I'll do it just to convince you.", "label": []}
{"id": 6849, "text": "But, so if I expand this, I will get A times, let me put that in a different color because you shouldn't write that down.", "label": []}
{"id": 6850, "text": "It's just to convince you again.", "label": []}
{"id": 6851, "text": "So, if you don't see it yet, let's expend this thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6852, "text": "We'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6853, "text": "Well, the two A's cancel out.", "label": []}
{"id": 6854, "text": "We get <EXPRESSION> the square of that's going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6855, "text": "Here, the a and the a simplifies, and now these two terms simplify and give me just <EXPRESSION> in the end.", "label": []}
{"id": 6856, "text": "OK, and that's kind of unreadable after I've canceled everything, but if you follow it, you see that basically I've just rewritten my initial function.", "label": []}
{"id": 6857, "text": "OK, is that kind of OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6858, "text": "I mean, otherwise there's just no substitute.", "label": []}
{"id": 6859, "text": "You'll have to do it yourself, I'm afraid.", "label": []}
{"id": 6860, "text": "OK, so, let me continue to play with this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6861, "text": "So, I'm just going to put this in a slightly different form just to clear the denominators.", "label": []}
{"id": 6862, "text": "OK, so, I will instead write this as <EXPRESSION> times the big thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6863, "text": "So, I'm going to just put <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6864, "text": "OK, so far I have the same thing as here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6865, "text": "I just introduced the <EXPRESSION> that cancels out, plus for the other one, I'm just clearing the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 6866, "text": "I end up with <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6867, "text": "OK, so that's a lot of terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 6868, "text": "But, what does it look like?", "label": []}
{"id": 6869, "text": "Well, it looks like, so we have some constant factors, and here we have a square, and here we have a square.", "label": []}
{"id": 6870, "text": "So, basically, we've written this as a sum of two squares, well, a sum or a difference of two squares.", "label": []}
{"id": 6871, "text": "And, maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values.", "label": []}
{"id": 6872, "text": "And you will have, the function will always take nonnegative values.", "label": []}
{"id": 6873, "text": "So, the origin will be a minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6874, "text": "Well, if you have a difference of two squares that typically you'll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger, you will have a positive or a negative quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6875, "text": "OK, so I claim there's various cases to look at.", "label": []}
{"id": 6876, "text": "So, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 6877, "text": "So, in fact, I claim there will be three cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 6878, "text": "And, that's good news for us because after all, we want to distinguish between three possibilities.", "label": []}
{"id": 6879, "text": "So, let's first do away with the most complicated one.", "label": []}
{"id": 6880, "text": "What if <EXPRESSION> is negative?", "label": []}
{"id": 6881, "text": "Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is, so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity, while the second one will be something negative times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6882, "text": "So, it will be a negative quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6883, "text": "OK, so one term is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 6884, "text": "The other is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6885, "text": "That tells us we actually have a saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6886, "text": "We have, in fact, written our function as a difference of two squares.", "label": []}
{"id": 6887, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "label": []}
{"id": 6888, "text": "So, if you want, what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates called <EQUATION>, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the difference of squares directly.", "label": []}
{"id": 6889, "text": "OK, so that's the first case.", "label": []}
{"id": 6890, "text": "The second case is where <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6891, "text": "Well, what happens if that's zero?", "label": []}
{"id": 6892, "text": "Then it means that this term over there goes away.", "label": []}
{"id": 6893, "text": "So, what we have is just one square.", "label": []}
{"id": 6894, "text": "OK, so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things.", "label": []}
{"id": 6895, "text": "In the other direction, it's going to actually be degenerate.", "label": []}
{"id": 6896, "text": "So, for example, forget all the clutter in there.", "label": []}
{"id": 6897, "text": "Say I give you just the function of two variables, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6898, "text": "So, that means it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION> at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 6899, "text": "And, if I try to plot the graph, it will look like, well, <EXPRESSION> is here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6900, "text": "So, it will depend on <EXPRESSION> in that way, but it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION> at all.", "label": []}
{"id": 6901, "text": "So, what the graph looks like is something like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6902, "text": "OK, basically it's a valley whose bottom is completely flat.", "label": []}
{"id": 6903, "text": "So, that means, actually, we have a degenerate critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6904, "text": "It's called degenerate because there is a direction in which nothing happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 6905, "text": "And, in fact, you have critical points everywhere along the y axis.", "label": []}
{"id": 6906, "text": "Now, whether the square that we have is <EXPRESSION> or something else, namely, <EXPRESSION>, it doesn't matter.", "label": []}
{"id": 6907, "text": "I mean, it will still get this degenerate behavior.", "label": []}
{"id": 6908, "text": "But there's a direction in which nothing happens because we just have the square of one quantity.", "label": []}
{"id": 6909, "text": "I'm sure that <EXPRESSION> students means <EXPRESSION> different ring tones, but I'm not eager to hear all of them, thanks.", "label": []}
{"id": 6910, "text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, so, this is what's called a degenerate critical point, and [LAUGHTER].", "label": []}
{"id": 6911, "text": "OK, so basically we'll leave it here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6912, "text": "We won't actually try to figure out further what happens, and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function, a general function, not just one that's quadratic like this, then there will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers, maybe <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or things like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6913, "text": "And then, they will mess up what happens in this valley.", "label": []}
{"id": 6914, "text": "And, it's a situation where we won't be able, actually, to tell automatically just by looking at second derivatives what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 6915, "text": "See, for example, in a function of one variable, if you have just a function of one variable, say, <EXPRESSION>, well, if you try to decide what type of point the origin is, you're going to take the second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6916, "text": "It will be <EXPRESSION>, and then you can conclude.", "label": []}
{"id": 6917, "text": "Those things depend on higher order derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 6918, "text": "So, we just won't like that case.", "label": []}
{"id": 6919, "text": "We just won't try to figure out what's going on here.", "label": []}
{"id": 6920, "text": "Now, the last situation is if <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 6921, "text": "So, then, that means that actually we've written things.", "label": []}
{"id": 6922, "text": "The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.", "label": []}
{"id": 6923, "text": "So, that means that we've written <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> plus something squared plus something else squared, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6924, "text": "So, these guys have the same sign, and that means that this term here will always be greater than or = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6925, "text": "And that means that we should either have a maximum or minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6926, "text": "How we find out which one it is?", "label": []}
{"id": 6927, "text": "Well, we look at the sign of a, exactly.", "label": []}
{"id": 6928, "text": "OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6929, "text": "So, there's two sub-cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 6930, "text": "One is if a is positive, then, this quantity overall will always be nonnegative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6931, "text": "And that means we have a minimum, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 6932, "text": "And, if a is negative on the other hand, so that means that we multiply this positive quantity by a negative number, we get something that's always negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6933, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is actually the maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 6934, "text": "OK, is that clear for everyone?", "label": []}
{"id": 6935, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6936, "text": "Sorry, yeah, so I said in the example <EQUATION>, it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6937, "text": "So, the more general situation is <EXPRESSION> = some constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 6938, "text": "Well, I guess it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6939, "text": "So, it does depend on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but it only depends on this combination.", "label": []}
{"id": 6940, "text": "OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular direction, in the direction where this remains constant, so maybe if I set <EQUATION>, then this remains zero all the time.", "label": []}
{"id": 6941, "text": "So, there's a degenerate direction in which I stay at the minimum or maximum, or whatever it is that I have.", "label": []}
{"id": 6942, "text": "OK, so that's why it's called degenerate.", "label": []}
{"id": 6943, "text": "There is a direction in which nothing happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 6944, "text": "OK, yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6945, "text": "Yes, yeah, so that's a very good question.", "label": []}
{"id": 6946, "text": "So, there's going to be the second derivative test.", "label": []}
{"id": 6947, "text": "Why do not have derivatives yet?", "label": []}
{"id": 6948, "text": "Well, that's because I've been looking at this special example where we have a function like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 6949, "text": "And, so I don't actually need to take derivatives yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 6950, "text": "But, secretly, that's because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> will be the second derivatives of the function, actually, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6951, "text": "So now, we are going to go to general function.", "label": []}
{"id": 6952, "text": "And there, instead of having these coefficients <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and  given to us, we'll have to compute them as second derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 6953, "text": "OK, so here, I'm basically setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion we'll use using second derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 6954, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6955, "text": "So, yeah, so what you have a degenerate critical point, it could be a degenerate minimum, or a degenerate maximum depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6956, "text": "But, in general, once you start having functions, you don't really know what will happen anymore.", "label": []}
{"id": 6957, "text": "It could also be a degenerate saddle, and so on.", "label": []}
{"id": 6958, "text": "So, we won't really be able to tell.", "label": []}
{"id": 6959, "text": "Yes?", "label": []}
{"id": 6960, "text": "It is possible to have a degenerate saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6961, "text": "For example, if I gave you <EXPRESSION>, you can convince yourself that if you take <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to be negative, it will be negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6962, "text": "If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, it's positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 6963, "text": "And, it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin.", "label": []}
{"id": 6964, "text": "So, that's a degenerate saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 6965, "text": "We don't see it here because that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 6966, "text": "You need to have higher-order terms to see it happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 6967, "text": "OK.", "label": []}
{"id": 6968, "text": "OK, so let's continue.", "label": []}
{"id": 6969, "text": "Before we continue, but see, I wanted to point out one small thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6970, "text": "So, here, we have the magic quantity, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6971, "text": "You've probably seen that before in your life.", "label": []}
{"id": 6972, "text": "Yet, it looks like the quadratic formula, except that one involves <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6973, "text": "But that's really the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 6974, "text": "OK, so let's see, where does the quadratic formula come in here?", "label": []}
{"id": 6975, "text": "Well, let me write things differently.", "label": []}
{"id": 6976, "text": "OK, so we've manipulated things, and got into a conclusion.", "label": []}
{"id": 6977, "text": "But, let me just do a different manipulation, and write this now instead as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6978, "text": "OK, see, that's the same thing that I had before.", "label": []}
{"id": 6979, "text": "Well, so now this quantity here is always nonnegative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6980, "text": "What about this one?", "label": []}
{"id": 6981, "text": "Well, of course, this one depends on <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6982, "text": "It means it depends on which direction you're going to move away from the origin, which ratio between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you will consider.", "label": []}
{"id": 6983, "text": "But, I claim there's two situations.", "label": []}
{"id": 6984, "text": "One is, so, let's try to reformulate things.", "label": []}
{"id": 6985, "text": "So, if a discriminate here is positive, then it means that these have roots and these have solutions.", "label": []}
{"id": 6986, "text": "And, that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6987, "text": "This quantity takes positive and negative values.", "label": []}
{"id": 6988, "text": "One way to convince yourself is just to, you know, plot <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6989, "text": "You know that there's two roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 6990, "text": "So, it might look like this, or might look like that depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6991, "text": "But, in either case, it will take values of both signs.", "label": []}
{"id": 6992, "text": "So, that means that your function will take values of both signs.", "label": []}
{"id": 6993, "text": "The value takes both positive and negative values.", "label": []}
{"id": 6994, "text": "And, so that means we have a saddle point, while the other situation, when <EXPRESSION> is negative -- -- means that this equation is quadratic never takes the value, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6995, "text": "So, it's always positive or it's always negative, depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6996, "text": "So, the other case is if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then the quadratic doesn't have a solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 6997, "text": "And it could look like this or like that depending on whether <EXPRESSION> is positive or <EXPRESSION> is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 6998, "text": "So, in particular, that means that <EXPRESSION> is always positive or always negative depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 6999, "text": "And then, that tells us that our function, , will be always positive or always negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 7000, "text": "And then we'll get a minimum or maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7001, "text": "OK, we'll have a min or a max depending on which situation we are in.", "label": []}
{"id": 7002, "text": "OK, so that's another way to derive the same answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 7003, "text": "And now, you see here why the discriminate plays a role.", "label": []}
{"id": 7004, "text": "That's because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign, or whether it can actually cross the value, <EXPRESSION>, when you have the root of a quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 7005, "text": "OK, so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations, at least.", "label": []}
{"id": 7006, "text": "And now, you are willing to believe, I hope, that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function.", "label": []}
{"id": 7007, "text": "OK, so, now what do we do with the general function?", "label": []}
{"id": 7008, "text": "Well, so in general, we want to look at second derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7009, "text": "OK, so now we are getting to the real stuff.", "label": []}
{"id": 7010, "text": "So, how many second derivatives do we have?", "label": []}
{"id": 7011, "text": "That's maybe the first thing we should figure out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7012, "text": "Well, we can take the derivative first with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then again with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7013, "text": "OK, that gives us something we denote by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7014, "text": "Then, there's another one which is ,<EXPRESSION> which means you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7015, "text": "Another thing you can do, is do first derivative respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7016, "text": "That would be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7017, "text": "Well, good news.", "label": []}
{"id": 7018, "text": "These are actually always = to each other.", "label": []}
{"id": 7019, "text": "OK, so it's the fact that we will admit, it's actually not very hard to check.", "label": []}
{"id": 7020, "text": "So these are always the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 7021, "text": "We don't need to worry about which one we do.", "label": []}
{"id": 7022, "text": "That's one computation that we won't need to do.", "label": []}
{"id": 7023, "text": "We can save a bit of effort.", "label": []}
{"id": 7024, "text": "And then, we have the last one, namely, the second partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7025, "text": "OK, so we have three of them.", "label": []}
{"id": 7026, "text": "So, what does the second derivative test say?", "label": []}
{"id": 7027, "text": "It says, say that you have a critical point (x0, y0) of a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION>, and then let's compute the partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7028, "text": "So, let's call capital A the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7029, "text": "Let's call capital B the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7030, "text": "And <EQUATION> at this point, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 7031, "text": "So, these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative, and then we plug in the values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7032, "text": "So, these will just be numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 7033, "text": "And now, what we do is we look at the quantity <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7034, "text": "I am not forgetting the four.", "label": []}
{"id": 7035, "text": "You will see why there isn't one.", "label": []}
{"id": 7036, "text": "So, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, then there's two sub-cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 7037, "text": "If A is positive, then it's local minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7038, "text": "The second case, so, still, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's going to be a local maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7039, "text": "And, if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's a saddle point, and finally, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then we actually cannot compute.", "label": []}
{"id": 7040, "text": "We don't know whether it's going to be a minimum, a maximum, or a saddle.", "label": []}
{"id": 7041, "text": "We know it's degenerate in some way, but we don't know what type of point it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 7042, "text": "OK, so that's actually what you need to remember.", "label": []}
{"id": 7043, "text": "If you are formula oriented, that's all you need to remember about today.", "label": []}
{"id": 7044, "text": "But, let's try to understand why, how this comes out of what we had there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7045, "text": "OK, so, I think maybe I actually want to keep, so maybe I want to keep this middle board because it actually has, you know, the recipe that we found before the quadratic function.", "label": []}
{"id": 7046, "text": "So, let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with the new.", "label": []}
{"id": 7047, "text": "OK, you are easily amused.", "label": []}
{"id": 7048, "text": "OK, so first, let's check that these two things say the same thing in the special case that we are looking at.", "label": []}
{"id": 7049, "text": "OK, so let's verify in the special case where the function was <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7050, "text": "So -- Well, what is the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7051, "text": "If I take the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so first I want to take maybe the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7052, "text": "But first, let's take the first partial, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7053, "text": "That will be <EXPRESSION> by, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7054, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be, well, let's take a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> again.", "label": []}
{"id": 7055, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7056, "text": "Wxy, I take the partial respect to <EXPRESSION>, and we'll get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7057, "text": "OK, now we need, also, the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7058, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7059, "text": "In case you don't believe what I told you about the mixed partials, <EXPRESSION>, well, you can check.", "label": []}
{"id": 7060, "text": "And it's, again, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7061, "text": "So, they are, indeed, the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7062, "text": "And, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7063, "text": "So, if we now look at these quantities, that tells us, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7064, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is what we used to call <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7065, "text": "OK, ooh.", "label": []}
{"id": 7066, "text": "[LAUGHTER] So, now you can compare the cases.", "label": []}
{"id": 7067, "text": "They are not listed in the same order just to make it harder.", "label": []}
{"id": 7068, "text": "So, we said first, so the saddle case is when <EXPRESSION> in big letters is negative, that's the same as <EXPRESSION> in lower case is negative.", "label": []}
{"id": 7069, "text": "The case where capital <EXPRESSION> is positive, local min and local max corresponds to this one.", "label": []}
{"id": 7070, "text": "And, the case where we can't conclude was what used to be the degenerate one.", "label": []}
{"id": 7071, "text": "OK, so at least we don't seem to have messed up when copying the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 7072, "text": "Now, why does that work more generally than that?", "label": []}
{"id": 7073, "text": "Well, the answer that is, again, Taylor approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7074, "text": "Aww.", "label": []}
{"id": 7075, "text": "OK, so let me just do here quadratic approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7076, "text": "So, quadratic approximation tells me the following thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7077, "text": "It tells me, if I have a function, <EXPRESSION>, and I want to understand the change in <EXPRESSION> when I change <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 7078, "text": "Well, there's the first-order terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 7079, "text": "There is the linear terms that by now you should know and be comfortable with.", "label": []}
{"id": 7080, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7081, "text": "And then, there's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7082, "text": "OK, that's the starting point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7083, "text": "But now, of course, if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, sorry, if we are at the critical point, then that's going to be <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7084, "text": "So, that term actually goes away, and that's also zero at the critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7085, "text": "So, that term also goes away.", "label": []}
{"id": 7086, "text": "OK, so linear approximation is really no good.", "label": []}
{"id": 7087, "text": "We need more terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 7088, "text": "So, what are the next terms?", "label": []}
{"id": 7089, "text": "Well, the next terms are quadratic terms, and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor formula for a function of a single variable, there was the derivative times <EXPRESSION> of a second derivative times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7090, "text": "And see, this side here is really Taylor approximation in one variable looking only at <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7091, "text": "But of course, we also have terms involving <EXPRESSION>, and terms involving simultaneously <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7092, "text": "And, these terms are <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7093, "text": "There's no one half in the middle because, in fact, you would have two terms, one for <EXPRESSION>, one for <EXPRESSION>, but they are the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 7094, "text": "And then, if you want to continue, there is actually cubic terms involving the third derivatives, and so on, but we are not actually looking at them.", "label": []}
{"id": 7095, "text": "And so, now, when we do this approximation, well, the type of critical point remains the same when we replace the function by this approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7096, "text": "And so, we can apply the argument that we used to deduce things in the quadratic case.", "label": []}
{"id": 7097, "text": "In fact, it still works in the general case using this approximation formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 7098, "text": "So -- The general case reduces to the quadratic case.", "label": []}
{"id": 7099, "text": "And now, you see actually why, well, here you see, again, how this coefficient which we used to call little a is also <EXPRESSION> of capital A.", "label": []}
{"id": 7100, "text": "And same here: this coefficient is what we call capital B or little b, and this coefficient here is what we called little c or <EXPRESSION> of capital C.", "label": []}
{"id": 7101, "text": "And then, when you replace these into the various cases that we had here, you end up with the second derivative test.", "label": []}
{"id": 7102, "text": "So, what about the degenerate case?", "label": []}
{"id": 7103, "text": "Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a degenerate critical point?", "label": []}
{"id": 7104, "text": "So, the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible.", "label": []}
{"id": 7105, "text": "OK, so in fact, secretly, there's more terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 7106, "text": "This is only an approximation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7107, "text": "There would be terms involving third derivatives, and maybe even beyond that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7108, "text": "And, so it is not to generate case, they don't actually matter because the shape of the function, the shape of the graph, is actually determined by the quadratic terms.", "label": []}
{"id": 7109, "text": "But, in the degenerate case, see, if I start with this and I add something even very, very small along the y axis, then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down, and turn my degenerate point in to either a minimum or a saddle point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7110, "text": "And, I won't be able to tell until I go further in the list of derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7111, "text": "So, in the degenerate case, what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7112, "text": "So, we will need to analyze things more carefully.", "label": []}
{"id": 7113, "text": "Well, we're not going to bother with that in this class.", "label": []}
{"id": 7114, "text": "So, we'll just say, well, we cannot compute, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 7115, "text": "I mean, you have to realize that in real life, you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7116, "text": "[LAUGHTER] Well, if that happens, then what you should do is maybe try by inspection.", "label": []}
{"id": 7117, "text": "See if there's a good reason why the function should always be positive or always be negative, or something.", "label": []}
{"id": 7118, "text": "Or, you know, plot it on a computer and see what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 7119, "text": "But, otherwise we can't compute.", "label": []}
{"id": 7120, "text": "OK, so let's do an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 7121, "text": "So, probably I should leave this on so that we still have the test with us.", "label": []}
{"id": 7122, "text": "And, instead, OK, so I'll do my example here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7123, "text": "OK, so just an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 7124, "text": "Let's look at <EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 7125, "text": "So, I'm looking only at the first quadrant.", "label": []}
{"id": 7126, "text": "OK, I mean, I'm doing this because I don't want the denominator to become <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7127, "text": "So, I'm just looking at the situation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7128, "text": "So, let's look first for, so, the question will be, what are the minimum and maximum of this function?", "label": []}
{"id": 7129, "text": "So, the first thing we should do to answer this question is look for critical points, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 7130, "text": "So, for that, we have to compute the first derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7131, "text": "OK, so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 7132, "text": "Take the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7133, "text": "And, we'll want to set that = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7134, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7135, "text": "And, we want to set that = to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7136, "text": "So, what are the equations we have to solve?", "label": []}
{"id": 7137, "text": "Well, I guess <EQUATION>, I mean, if I move this guy over here I get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7138, "text": "That's <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7139, "text": "What do you get by comparing these two?", "label": []}
{"id": 7140, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> should both be, OK, so yeah, I agree with you that one and one is a solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7141, "text": "Why is it the only one?", "label": []}
{"id": 7142, "text": "So, first, if I divide this one by that one, I get <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7143, "text": "So, it tells me <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7144, "text": "And then, if <EQUATION>, then if I put that into here, it will give me <EQUATION>, which tells me <EQUATION>, and therefore, <EQUATION> as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 7145, "text": "OK, so, there's only one solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7146, "text": "There's only one critical point, which is going to be (1, 1).", "label": []}
{"id": 7147, "text": "OK, so, now here's where you do a bit of work.", "label": []}
{"id": 7148, "text": "What do you think of that critical point?", "label": []}
{"id": 7149, "text": "OK, I see some valid votes.", "label": []}
{"id": 7150, "text": "I see some, OK, I see a lot of people answering four.", "label": []}
{"id": 7151, "text": "[LAUGHTER] that seems to suggest that maybe you haven't completed the second derivative yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 7152, "text": "Yes, I see someone giving the correct answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 7153, "text": "I see some people not giving quite the correct answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 7154, "text": "I see more and more correct answers.", "label": []}
{"id": 7155, "text": "OK, so let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 7156, "text": "To figure out what type of point is, we should compute the second partial derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7157, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is, what do we get what we take the derivative of this with respect to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7158, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK?", "label": []}
{"id": 7159, "text": "So, at our point, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7160, "text": "<EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7161, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7162, "text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is going to be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7163, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7164, "text": "And so that tells us, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7165, "text": "Sorry, I should probably use a different blackboard for that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7166, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7167, "text": "It's positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 7168, "text": "That tells us we are either a local minimum or local maximum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7169, "text": "And, <EXPRESSION> is positive.", "label": []}
{"id": 7170, "text": "So, it's a local minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7171, "text": "And, in fact, you can check it's the global minimum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7172, "text": "What about the maximum?", "label": []}
{"id": 7173, "text": "Well, if a maximum is not actually at a critical point, it's on the boundary, or at infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 7174, "text": "See, so we have actually to check what happens when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> go to <EXPRESSION> or to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 7175, "text": "Well, if that happens, if <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, then the function goes to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 7176, "text": "Also, if <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity.", "label": []}
{"id": 7177, "text": "So, the maximum, well, the function goes to infinity when <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity or <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, or <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> go to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7178, "text": "So, it's not at a critical point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7179, "text": "OK, so, in general, we have to check both the critical points and the boundaries to decide what happens.", "label": []}
{"id": 7180, "text": "OK, the end.", "label": []}
{"id": 7181, "text": "Have a nice weekend.", "label": []}
{"id": 7183, "text": "Let's solve another 2nd order linear homogeneous differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7184, "text": "And this one-- well, I won't give you the details before I actually write it down.", "label": []}
{"id": 7185, "text": "So the differential equation is <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7187, "text": "And we have <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7190, "text": "But in this video, I'm just going to show you, literally, how quickly you can do these type of problems mechanically.", "label": []}
{"id": 7191, "text": "So if this is our original differential equation, the characteristic equation is going to be-- and I'll do this in a different color-- <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7192, "text": "And watch the previous video if you don't know where this characteristic equation comes from.", "label": []}
{"id": 7193, "text": "But if you want to do these problems really quick, you just substitute the 2nd derivatives with an <EXPRESSION>, the first derivatives with an <EXPRESSION>, and then the function with-- oh sorry, no.", "label": []}
{"id": 7194, "text": "This is supposed to be a constant-- And then the coefficient on the original function is just a constant, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7195, "text": "I think you see what I did.", "label": []}

{"id": 7197, "text": "1st derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7198, "text": "No derivative-- you could say that's <EXPRESSION>, or just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7199, "text": "But this is our characteristic equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7200, "text": "And now we can just figure out its roots.", "label": []}
{"id": 7201, "text": "This is not a trivial one for me to factor so, if it's not trivial, you can just use the quadratic equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7202, "text": "So we could say the solution of this is <EQUATION>-- <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>-- <EXPRESSION> plus or minus <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7203, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7204, "text": "All of that over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7223, "text": "<EXPRESSION> of our general solution = <EXPRESSION>, plus-- derivative of the inside-- <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7224, "text": "And now let's use our actual initial conditions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7225, "text": "I don't want to lose them-- let me rewrite them down here so I can scroll down.", "label": []}
{"id": 7226, "text": "So we know that <EXPRESSION> is = to <EXPRESSION>, and <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7227, "text": "Those are our initial conditions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7228, "text": "So let's use that information.", "label": []}
{"id": 7229, "text": "So <EXPRESSION>-- what happens when you substitute <EQUATION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7230, "text": "?", "label": []}
{"id": 7231, "text": "You get <EXPRESSION>, essentially, so that's just <EXPRESSION>-- well that's just <EXPRESSION> again, because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>-- =-- so this is, when <EQUATION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7232, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7233, "text": "<EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7234, "text": "And then let's use the second equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7235, "text": "So when we substitute <EXPRESSION> is = to <EXPRESSION> in the derivative-- so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> we get <EXPRESSION>-- this goes to <EXPRESSION> again-- plus <EXPRESSION>-- this is <EXPRESSION> again, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>-- is = to-- so when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> for the derivative, <EQUATION>, or the derivative is <EXPRESSION> at that point, or the slope is <EXPRESSION> at that point.", "label": []}
{"id": 7236, "text": "And now we have two equations and two unknowns, and we could solve it a ton of ways.", "label": []}
{"id": 7237, "text": "I think you know how to solve them.", "label": []}
{"id": 7238, "text": "Let's multiply the top equation-- I don't know-- let's multiply it by <EXPRESSION>, and what do we get?", "label": []}
{"id": 7239, "text": "We get-- I'll do it in a different color-- we get <EXPRESSION> =-- what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7240, "text": "It's = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7241, "text": "And now, let's subtract-- well, I don't want to confuse you, so let's just subtract the bottom from the top, so this cancels out.", "label": []}
{"id": 7242, "text": "What's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7243, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7244, "text": "Well, that's just minus <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7245, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> =-- what's <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7246, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7247, "text": "And so we get <EXPRESSION> is = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7248, "text": "And we can substitute back in this top equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7249, "text": "<EQUATION>, or <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7250, "text": "And now we can just substitute <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> back into our general solution and we have found the particular solution of this differential equation, which is <EQUATION>-- <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, and we are done.", "label": []}
{"id": 7251, "text": "And it might seem really fancy.", "label": []}
{"id": 7252, "text": "We're solving a differential equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7253, "text": "Our solution has <EXPRESSION> in it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7254, "text": "We're taking derivatives and we're doing all sorts of things.", "label": []}
{"id": 7255, "text": "But really the meat of this problem was solving a quadratic, which was our characteristic equation.", "label": []}
{"id": 7256, "text": "And watch the previous video just to see why this characteristic equation works.", "label": []}
{"id": 7257, "text": "But it's very easy to come up with the characteristic equation, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7258, "text": "I think you obviously see that <EXPRESSION> turns into <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> turns into <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> just turns into <EXPRESSION>, essentially.", "label": []}
{"id": 7259, "text": "So you solve a quadratic.", "label": []}
{"id": 7260, "text": "And then after doing that, you just have to take one derivative-- because after solving the quadratic, you immediately have the general solution-- then you take its derivative, use your initial conditions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7261, "text": "You have a system of linear equations which is Algebra I.", "label": []}
{"id": 7262, "text": "And then you solve them for the two constants, c1 and c2, and you end up with your particular solution.", "label": []}
{"id": 7263, "text": "And that's all there is to it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7264, "text": "I will see you in the next video.", "label": []}
{"id": 7799, "text": "Professor: I am Haynes Miller, I am substituting for David Jerison today.", "label": []}
{"id": 7800, "text": "So you have a substitute teacher today.", "label": []}
{"id": 7801, "text": "So I haven't been here in this class with you so I'm not completely sure where you are.", "label": []}
{"id": 7802, "text": "I think you've just been talking about differentiation and you've got some examples of differentiation like these basic examples: the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7803, "text": "But I think maybe you've spent some time computing the derivative of the sine function as well, recently.", "label": []}
{"id": 7804, "text": "And I think you have some rules for extending these calculations as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 7805, "text": "For instance, I think you know that if you differentiate a constant times a function, what do you get?", "label": []}
{"id": 7806, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 7807, "text": "Professor: The constant comes outside like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7808, "text": "Or I could write <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7809, "text": "That's this rule, multiplying by a constant, and I think you also know about differentiating a sum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7810, "text": "Or I could write this as <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7811, "text": "So I'm going to be using those but today I'll talk about a collection of other rules about how to deal with a product of functions, a quotient of functions, and, best of all, composition of functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7812, "text": "And then at the end, I'll have something to say about higher derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 7813, "text": "So that's the story for today.", "label": []}
{"id": 7814, "text": "That's the program.", "label": []}
{"id": 7815, "text": "So let's begin by talking about the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 7816, "text": "So the product rule tells you how to differentiate a product of functions, and I'll just give you the rule, first of all.", "label": []}
{"id": 7817, "text": "The rule is it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7818, "text": "It's a little bit funny.", "label": []}
{"id": 7819, "text": "Differentiating a product gives you a sum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7820, "text": "But let's see how that works out in a particular example.", "label": []}
{"id": 7821, "text": "For example, suppose that I wanted to differentiate the product.", "label": []}
{"id": 7822, "text": "Well, the product of these two basic examples that we just talked about.", "label": []}
{"id": 7823, "text": "I'm going to use the same variable in both cases instead of different ones like I did here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7824, "text": "So the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7825, "text": "So this is a new thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 7826, "text": "We couldn't do this without using the product rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 7827, "text": "So the first function is <EXPRESSION> and the second one is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7828, "text": "And we're going to apply this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 7829, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7830, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is, according to the rule, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7831, "text": "And then I take <EXPRESSION> and write it down the way it is, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7832, "text": "And then I do it the other way.", "label": []}
{"id": 7833, "text": "I take <EXPRESSION> the way it is, that's <EXPRESSION>, and multiply it by the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7834, "text": "We just saw <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7835, "text": "So that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7836, "text": "Obviously, you can differentiate longer products, products of more things by doing it one at a time.", "label": []}
{"id": 7837, "text": "Let's see why this is true.", "label": []}
{"id": 7838, "text": "I want to try to show you why the product rule holds.", "label": []}
{"id": 7839, "text": "So you have a standard way of trying to understand this, and it involves looking at the change in the function that you're interested in differentiating.", "label": []}
{"id": 7840, "text": "So I should look at how much the product <EXPRESSION> changes when <EXPRESSION> changes a little bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 7841, "text": "Well, so how do compute the change?", "label": []}
{"id": 7842, "text": "Well, I write down the value of the function at some new value of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7843, "text": "Well, I better write down the whole new value of the function, and the function is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7844, "text": "So the whole new value looks like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7845, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7846, "text": "That's the new value.", "label": []}
{"id": 7847, "text": "But what's the change in the product?", "label": []}
{"id": 7848, "text": "Well, I better subtract off what the old value was, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7849, "text": "Okay, according to the rule we're trying to prove, I have to get <EXPRESSION> involved.", "label": []}
{"id": 7850, "text": "So I want to involve the change in <EXPRESSION> alone, by itself.", "label": []}
{"id": 7851, "text": "Let's just try that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7852, "text": "I see part of the formula for the change in <EXPRESSION> right there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7853, "text": "Let's see if we can get the rest of it in place.", "label": []}
{"id": 7854, "text": "So the change in <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7855, "text": "That's the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7856, "text": "This part of it occurs up here, multiplied by <EXPRESSION>, so let's put that in too.", "label": []}
{"id": 7857, "text": "Now this equality sign isn't very good right now.", "label": []}
{"id": 7858, "text": "I've got this product here so far, but I've introduced something I don't like.", "label": []}
{"id": 7859, "text": "I've introduced <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7860, "text": "Minus that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7861, "text": "So the next thing I'm gonna do is correct that little defect by adding in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7862, "text": "Okay, now I cancelled off what was wrong with this line.", "label": []}
{"id": 7863, "text": "But I'm still not quite there, because I haven't put this in yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 7864, "text": "So I better subtract off <EXPRESSION>, and then I'll be home.", "label": []}
{"id": 7865, "text": "But I'm going to do that in a clever way, because I noticed that I already have a <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7866, "text": "So I'm gonna take this factor of <EXPRESSION> and make it the same as this factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 7867, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION> times this, <EXPRESSION> times that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7868, "text": "That's the same thing as <EXPRESSION> times the difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 7869, "text": "So that was a little bit strange, but when you stand back and look at it, you can see multiplied out, the middle terms cancel.", "label": []}
{"id": 7870, "text": "And you get the right answer.", "label": []}
{"id": 7871, "text": "Well I like that because it's involved the change in <EXPRESSION> and the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7872, "text": "So this = <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7873, "text": "Well, I'm almost there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7874, "text": "The next step in computing the derivative is take difference quotient, divide this by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7875, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> is well, I'll say <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7876, "text": "Have I made a mistake here?", "label": []}
{"id": 7877, "text": "This plus magically became a minus on the way down here, so I better fix that.", "label": []}
{"id": 7878, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7879, "text": "This <EXPRESSION> is this <EXPRESSION> over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7880, "text": "So I've just divided this formula by <EXPRESSION>, and now I can take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, so this is as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7881, "text": "This becomes the definition of the derivative, and on this side, I get <EXPRESSION> times.", "label": []}
{"id": 7882, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 7883, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 7884, "text": "now what happens to this quantity when <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7885, "text": "So this quantity is getting closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7886, "text": "So what happens to the value of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7887, "text": "It becomes = <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7888, "text": "That uses continuity of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7889, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> by continuity.", "label": []}
{"id": 7890, "text": "So this gives me times <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION> times, and <EXPRESSION> gives me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7891, "text": "And that's the formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 7892, "text": "That's the formula as I wrote it down at the beginning over here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7893, "text": "The derivative of a product is given by this sum.", "label": []}
{"id": 7894, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 7895, "text": "Student: How did you get from the first line to the second of the long equation?", "label": []}
{"id": 7896, "text": "Professor: From here to here?", "label": []}
{"id": 7897, "text": "Student: Yes.", "label": []}
{"id": 7898, "text": "Professor: So maybe it's easiest to work backwards and verify that what I wrote down is correct here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7899, "text": "So, if you look there's a <EXPRESSION> there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7900, "text": "And there's also one here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7901, "text": "And they occur with opposite signs.", "label": []}
{"id": 7902, "text": "So they cancel.", "label": []}
{"id": 7903, "text": "What's left is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7904, "text": "And that's just what I started with.", "label": []}
{"id": 7905, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] They cancel right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7906, "text": "Professor: I cancelled out this term and this term, and what's left is the ends.", "label": []}
{"id": 7907, "text": "Any other questions?", "label": []}
{"id": 7908, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 7909, "text": "Professor: Well, I just calculated what delta uv is, and now I'm gonna divide that by <EXPRESSION> on my way to computing the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 7910, "text": "And so I copied down the right hand side and divided <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7911, "text": "I just decided to divide the <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7912, "text": "Good.", "label": []}
{"id": 7913, "text": "Anything else?", "label": []}
{"id": 7914, "text": "So we have the product rule here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7915, "text": "The rule for differentiating a product of two functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7916, "text": "This is making us stronger.", "label": []}
{"id": 7917, "text": "There are many more functions you can find derivatives of now.", "label": []}
{"id": 7918, "text": "How about quotients?", "label": []}
{"id": 7919, "text": "Let's find out how to differentiate a quotient of two functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7920, "text": "Well again, I'll write down what the answer is and then we'll try to verify it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7921, "text": "So there's a quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 7922, "text": "Let me write this down.", "label": []}
{"id": 7923, "text": "There's a quotient of two functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 7924, "text": "And here's the rule for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7925, "text": "I always have to think about this and hope that I get it right.", "label": []}

{"id": 7927, "text": "This may be the craziest rule you'll see in this course, but there it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 7928, "text": "And I'll try to show you why that's true and see an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 7929, "text": "Yeah there was a hand?", "label": []}
{"id": 7930, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE] Professor: What letters look the same?", "label": []}

{"id": 7935, "text": "What's the new value of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7936, "text": "The value of <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 7937, "text": "That's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 7938, "text": "It's the change in <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> gets replaced by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7939, "text": "And the change in <EXPRESSION>, the new value <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7940, "text": "So this is the new value of <EXPRESSION> divided by the new value of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7941, "text": "That's the beginning.", "label": []}
{"id": 7942, "text": "And then I subtract off the old values, which are <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7943, "text": "This'll be easier to work out when I write it out this way.", "label": []}
{"id": 7944, "text": "So now, we'll cross multiply, as I said.", "label": []}
{"id": 7945, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>, now I cross multiply this way, you get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7946, "text": "And I divide all this by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7947, "text": "Okay, now the reason I like to do it this way is that you see the cancellation happening here.", "label": []}
{"id": 7948, "text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> occur twice and so I can cancel them.", "label": []}
{"id": 7949, "text": "And I will, and I'll answer these questions in a minute.", "label": []}

{"id": 7951, "text": "Professor: Ooh, that's a <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7952, "text": "All right.", "label": []}
{"id": 7953, "text": "Good, anything else?", "label": []}
{"id": 7954, "text": "That's what all hands were.", "label": []}
{"id": 7955, "text": "Good.", "label": []}
{"id": 7956, "text": "All right, so I cancel these and what I'm left with then is <EXPRESSION> and all this is over <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7957, "text": "Okay, there's the difference.", "label": []}
{"id": 7958, "text": "There's the change in the quotient.", "label": []}
{"id": 7959, "text": "The change in this function is given by this formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 7960, "text": "And now to compute the derivative, I want to divide by <EXPRESSION>, and take the limit.", "label": []}
{"id": 7961, "text": "So let's write that down, <EXPRESSION> is this formula here divided by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7962, "text": "And again, I'm going to put the <EXPRESSION> under these <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7964, "text": "I'm gonna put <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, but I can think of that as dividing into this factor and this factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 7965, "text": "So this is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7970, "text": "I get, by definition, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7972, "text": "Times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7973, "text": "See and then <EXPRESSION> times, and here it's the derivative <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7974, "text": "Now what about the denominator?", "label": []}
{"id": 7975, "text": "So when <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> stays the same, <EXPRESSION> stays the same.", "label": []}
{"id": 7976, "text": "What happens to this <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 7977, "text": "It goes to <EXPRESSION>, again, because <EXPRESSION> is continuous.", "label": []}
{"id": 7978, "text": "So again, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> because they're continuous and you just get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7979, "text": "I think that's the formula I wrote down over there.", "label": []}
{"id": 7980, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7981, "text": "And all divided by the square of the old denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 7982, "text": "Well, that's it.", "label": []}
{"id": 7983, "text": "That's the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 7984, "text": "Weird formula.", "label": []}
{"id": 7985, "text": "Let's see an application.", "label": []}
{"id": 7986, "text": "Let's see an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 7987, "text": "So the example I'm going to give is pretty simple.", "label": []}
{"id": 7988, "text": "I'm going to take the numerator to be just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7989, "text": "So I'm gonna take <EQUATION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 7994, "text": "I don't have to worry about this.", "label": []}
{"id": 7995, "text": "I get a minus.", "label": []}
{"id": 7996, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7997, "text": "Well, <EXPRESSION> is whatever <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 7998, "text": "I'll write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 7999, "text": "And then I get a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.", "label": []}
{"id": 8000, "text": "So that's the rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8001, "text": "I could write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8002, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8003, "text": "That's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8004, "text": "How about sub-example of that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8005, "text": "I'm going to take the special case where <EQUATION> again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8006, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is a power of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8007, "text": "And I'm gonna use the rule that we developed earlier about the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8008, "text": "So what do I get here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8009, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is, I'm plugging into this formula here with <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8010, "text": "So I get minus, uh, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8011, "text": "If <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is, by the rule of exponents, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8012, "text": "And then <EXPRESSION> is the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8013, "text": "Okay, so let's put these together.", "label": []}
{"id": 8014, "text": "There's several powers of <EXPRESSION> here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8015, "text": "I can put them together.", "label": []}
{"id": 8016, "text": "I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8017, "text": "One of these n's cancels.", "label": []}
{"id": 8018, "text": "And what I'm left with is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8019, "text": "So we've computed the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, which I could also write as <EXPRESSION>, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8020, "text": "So I've computed the derivative of negative powers of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8021, "text": "And this is the formula that I get.", "label": []}
{"id": 8022, "text": "If you think of this <EXPRESSION> as a unit, as a thing to itself, it occurs here in the exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8023, "text": "It occurs here, and it occurs here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8024, "text": "So how does that compare with the formula that we had up here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8025, "text": "The derivative of a power of <EXPRESSION> is that power times <EXPRESSION> to one less than that power.", "label": []}
{"id": 8026, "text": "That's exactly the same as the rule that I wrote down here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8027, "text": "But the power here happens to be a negative number, and the same negative number shows up as a coefficient and there in the exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8028, "text": "Yeah?", "label": []}
{"id": 8029, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 8030, "text": "Professor: How did I do this?", "label": []}
{"id": 8031, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 8032, "text": "Professor: Where did that <EXPRESSION> come from?", "label": []}
{"id": 8033, "text": "So I'm applying this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8034, "text": "So the denominator in the quotient rule is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8035, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>, so the denominator is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8036, "text": "And I decided to write it as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8037, "text": "So the green comments there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8038, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 8039, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 8040, "text": "What they say is that I can enlarge this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8041, "text": "This exact same rule is true for negative values of <EXPRESSION>, as well as positive values of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8042, "text": "So there's something new in your list of rules that you can apply, of values of the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8043, "text": "That standard rule is true for negative as well as positive exponents.", "label": []}
{"id": 8044, "text": "And that comes out of a quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8045, "text": "Okay, so we've done two rules.", "label": []}
{"id": 8046, "text": "I've talked about the product rule and the quotient rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8047, "text": "What's next?", "label": []}
{"id": 8048, "text": "Let's see the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8049, "text": "So this is a composition rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8050, "text": "So the kind of thing that I have in mind, composition of functions is about substitution.", "label": []}
{"id": 8051, "text": "So the kind of function that I have in mind is, for instance, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8052, "text": "That's a new one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8053, "text": "We haven't seen how to differentiate that before, I think.", "label": []}
{"id": 8054, "text": "This kind of power of a trig function happens very often.", "label": []}
{"id": 8055, "text": "You've seen them happen, as well, I'm sure, already.", "label": []}
{"id": 8056, "text": "And there's a little notational switch that people use.", "label": []}
{"id": 8057, "text": "They'll write <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8058, "text": "But remember that when you write <EXPRESSION>, what you mean is take the sine of <EXPRESSION>, and then take the 10th power of that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8059, "text": "It's the meaning of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8060, "text": "So the method of dealing with this kind of composition of functions is to use new variable names.", "label": []}
{"id": 8061, "text": "What I mean is, I can think of this <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8062, "text": "I can think of it it as a two step process.", "label": []}
{"id": 8063, "text": "First of all, I compute the sine of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8064, "text": "And let's call the result <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8065, "text": "There's the new variable name.", "label": []}
{"id": 8066, "text": "And then, I express <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8067, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> says take this and raise it to the tenth power.", "label": []}
{"id": 8068, "text": "In other words, <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8069, "text": "And then you plug <EQUATION> into that, and you get the formula for what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8070, "text": "So it's good practice to introduce new letters when they're convenient, and this is one place where it's very convenient.", "label": []}
{"id": 8071, "text": "So let's find a rule for differentiating a composition, a function that can be expressed by doing one function and then applying another function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8072, "text": "And here's the rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8073, "text": "Well, maybe I'll actually derive this rule first, and then you'll see what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8074, "text": "In fact, the rule is very simple to derive.", "label": []}
{"id": 8075, "text": "So this is a proof first, and then we'll write down the rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8076, "text": "I'm interested in <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8077, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8078, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8079, "text": "And I'm interested in how <EXPRESSION> changes with respect to <EXPRESSION>, with respect to the original variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8080, "text": "Well, because of that intermediate variable, I can write this as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8081, "text": "It cancels, right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8082, "text": "The <EXPRESSION> cancels.", "label": []}
{"id": 8083, "text": "The change in that immediate variable cancels out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8084, "text": "This is just basic algebra.", "label": []}
{"id": 8085, "text": "But what happens when I let <EXPRESSION> get small?", "label": []}
{"id": 8086, "text": "Well this give me <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8087, "text": "On the right-hand side, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8088, "text": "So students will often remember this rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8089, "text": "This is the rule, by saying that you can cancel out for the dx's.", "label": []}
{"id": 8090, "text": "And that's not so far from the truth.", "label": []}
{"id": 8091, "text": "That's a good way to think of it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8092, "text": "In other words, this is the so-called chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8093, "text": "And it says that differentiation of a composition is a product.", "label": []}
{"id": 8094, "text": "It's just the product of the two derivatives.", "label": []}
{"id": 8095, "text": "So that's how you differentiate a composite of two functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8096, "text": "And let's just do an example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8097, "text": "Let's do this example.", "label": []}
{"id": 8098, "text": "Let's see how that comes out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8099, "text": "So let's differentiate, what did I say?", "label": []}
{"id": 8100, "text": "<EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8101, "text": "Okay, there's an inside function and an outside function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8102, "text": "The inside function is <EXPRESSION> as a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8103, "text": "This is the inside function, and this is the outside function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8104, "text": "So the rule says, first of all let's differentiate the outside function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8105, "text": "Take <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8106, "text": "Differentiate it with respect to that variable <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8107, "text": "The outside function is the 10th power.", "label": []}
{"id": 8108, "text": "What's its derivative?", "label": []}
{"id": 8109, "text": "So I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8110, "text": "In this account, I'm using this newly introduced variable named <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8111, "text": "So the derivative of the outside function is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8112, "text": "And then here's the inside function, and the next thing I want to do is differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8113, "text": "So what's <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8114, "text": "All right, that's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8115, "text": "That's what the chain rule gives you.", "label": []}
{"id": 8116, "text": "This is correct, but since we were the ones to introduce this notation <EXPRESSION> here, that wasn't given to us in the original problem here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8117, "text": "The last step in this process should be to put back, to substitute back in what <EXPRESSION> is in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8118, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8119, "text": "So that tells me that I get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>, times the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8120, "text": "Or the same thing is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8121, "text": "So there's an application of the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8122, "text": "You know, people often wonder where the name chain rule comes from.", "label": []}
{"id": 8123, "text": "I was just wondering about that myself.", "label": []}
{"id": 8124, "text": "So is it because it chains you down?", "label": []}
{"id": 8125, "text": "Is it like a chain fence?", "label": []}
{"id": 8126, "text": "I decided what it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8127, "text": "It's because by using it, you burst the chains of differentiation, and you can differentiate many more functions using it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8128, "text": "So when you want to think of the chain rule, just think of that chain there.", "label": []}
{"id": 8129, "text": "It lets you burst free.", "label": []}
{"id": 8130, "text": "Let me give you another application of the chain rule.", "label": []}
{"id": 8131, "text": "Ready for this one?", "label": []}
{"id": 8132, "text": "So I'd like to differentiate the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8133, "text": "Again, this is the composite of two functions.", "label": []}
{"id": 8134, "text": "What's the inside function?", "label": []}
{"id": 8135, "text": "Okay, so I think I'll introduce this new notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8136, "text": "<EQUATION>, and the outside function is the sine.", "label": []}
{"id": 8137, "text": "So <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8138, "text": "So now the chain rule says <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8139, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 8140, "text": ".", "label": []}
{"id": 8141, "text": "Okay, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8142, "text": "I take the derivative of the outside function, and what's that?", "label": []}
{"id": 8143, "text": "Sine prime and we can substitute because we know what sine prime is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8144, "text": "So I get cosine of whatever, <EXPRESSION>, and then times what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8145, "text": "Now I differentiate the inside function, which is just <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8146, "text": "So I could write this as <EXPRESSION> of what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8147, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8148, "text": "Now, once you get used to this, this middle variable, you don't have to give a name for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8149, "text": "You can just to think about it in your mind without actually writing it down, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8150, "text": "I'll just do it again without introducing this middle variable explicitly.", "label": []}
{"id": 8151, "text": "Think about it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8152, "text": "I first of all differentiate the outside function, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8153, "text": "But I don't change the thing that I'm plugging into it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8154, "text": "It's still <EXPRESSION> that I'm plugging into it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8155, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8156, "text": "So let's just write <EXPRESSION> and not worry about the name of that extra variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8157, "text": "If it confuses you, introduce the new variable.", "label": []}
{"id": 8158, "text": "And do it carefully and slowly like this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8159, "text": "But, quite quickly, I think you'll get to be able to keep that step in your mind.", "label": []}
{"id": 8160, "text": "I'm not quite done yet.", "label": []}
{"id": 8161, "text": "I haven't differentiated the inside function, the derivative of <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8162, "text": "So you get, again, the same result.", "label": []}
{"id": 8163, "text": "A little shortcut that you'll get used to.", "label": []}
{"id": 8164, "text": "Really and truly, once you have the chain rule, the world is yours to conquer.", "label": []}
{"id": 8165, "text": "It puts you in a very, very powerful position.", "label": []}
{"id": 8166, "text": "Okay, well let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8167, "text": "What have I covered today?", "label": []}
{"id": 8168, "text": "I've talked about product rule, quotient rule, composition.", "label": []}
{"id": 8169, "text": "I should tell you something about higher derivatives, as well.", "label": []}
{"id": 8170, "text": "So let's do that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8171, "text": "This is a simple story.", "label": []}
{"id": 8172, "text": "Higher is kind of a strange word.", "label": []}
{"id": 8173, "text": "It just means differentiate over and over again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8174, "text": "All right, so let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8175, "text": "If we have a function <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, please allow me to just write it as briefly as <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8176, "text": "Well, this is a sort of notational thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8177, "text": "I can differentiate it and get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8178, "text": "That's a new function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8179, "text": "Like if you started with the sine, that's gonna be the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8180, "text": "A new function, so I can differentiate it again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8181, "text": "And the notation for the differentiating of it again, is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8182, "text": "So <EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION> differentiated again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8183, "text": "For example, if <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8184, "text": "Has Professor Jerison talked about what the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is?", "label": []}
{"id": 8185, "text": "What is it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8186, "text": "Ha, okay so <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8187, "text": "Let me go on.", "label": []}
{"id": 8188, "text": "What do you suppose <EXPRESSION> means?", "label": []}
{"id": 8189, "text": "I guess it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8190, "text": "It's called the third derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8191, "text": "And <EXPRESSION> is called the second derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8192, "text": "And it's <EXPRESSION> differentiated again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8193, "text": "So to compute <EXPRESSION> in this example, what do I do?", "label": []}
{"id": 8194, "text": "I differentiate that again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8195, "text": "There's a constant term, <EXPRESSION>, constant factor.", "label": []}
{"id": 8196, "text": "That comes out.", "label": []}
{"id": 8197, "text": "The derivative of <EXPRESSION> is what?", "label": []}
{"id": 8198, "text": "Okay, so <EQUATION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8199, "text": "Let's do it again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8200, "text": "Now after a while, you get tired of writing these things.", "label": []}
{"id": 8201, "text": "And so maybe I'll use the notation <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8202, "text": "That's the fourth derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8203, "text": "That's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8204, "text": "Or it's <EXPRESSION> differentiated again, the fourth derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8205, "text": "And what is that in this example?", "label": []}
{"id": 8206, "text": "Okay, the <EXPRESSION>cosine has derivative minus the <EXPRESSION>, like you told me.", "label": []}
{"id": 8207, "text": "And that minus sign cancels with that sign, and all together, I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8208, "text": "That's pretty bizarre.", "label": []}
{"id": 8209, "text": "When I differentiate the function <EXPRESSION> four times, I get back to the <EXPRESSION> again.", "label": []}
{"id": 8210, "text": "That's the way it is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8211, "text": "Now this notation, prime prime prime prime, and things like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8212, "text": "There are different variants of that notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8213, "text": "For example, that's another notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8214, "text": "Well, you've used the notation <EXPRESSION> before.", "label": []}
{"id": 8215, "text": "<EXPRESSION> could also be denoted <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8216, "text": "I think we've already here, today, used this way of rewriting <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8217, "text": "I think when I was talking about <EXPRESSION> and so on, I pulled that <EXPRESSION> outside and put whatever function you're differentiating over to the right.", "label": []}
{"id": 8218, "text": "So that's just a notational switch.", "label": []}
{"id": 8219, "text": "It looks good.", "label": []}
{"id": 8220, "text": "It looks like good algebra doesn't it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8221, "text": "But what it's doing is regarding this notation as an operator.", "label": []}
{"id": 8222, "text": "It's something you apply to a function to get a new function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8223, "text": "I apply it to the sine function, and I get the cosine function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8224, "text": "I apply it to <EXPRESSION>, and I get <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8225, "text": "This thing here, that symbol, represents an operator, which you apply to a function.", "label": []}
{"id": 8226, "text": "And the operator says, take the function and differentiate it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8227, "text": "So further notation that people often use, is they give a different name to that operator.", "label": []}
{"id": 8228, "text": "And they'll write capital D for it.", "label": []}
{"id": 8229, "text": "So this is just using capital D for the symbol <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8230, "text": "So in terms of that notation, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8231, "text": "Let's write down what higher derivatives look like.", "label": []}
{"id": 8232, "text": "So let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8233, "text": "That's what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8234, "text": "How about <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8235, "text": "Let's write that in terms of the <EXPRESSION> notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8236, "text": "Well I'm supposed to differentiate <EXPRESSION> right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8237, "text": "So that's <EXPRESSION> applied to the function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8238, "text": "Differentiate the derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8239, "text": "That's what I've done.", "label": []}
{"id": 8240, "text": "Or I could write that as <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8241, "text": "Just pulling that <EXPRESSION> outside.", "label": []}
{"id": 8242, "text": "So I'm doing <EXPRESSION> twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 8243, "text": "I'm doing that operator twice.", "label": []}

{"id": 8247, "text": "I could also write as-- like that.", "label": []}
{"id": 8248, "text": "It's getting stranger and stranger, isn't it?", "label": []}
{"id": 8249, "text": "This is definitely just a kind of abuse of notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8250, "text": "But people will go even further and write <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8251, "text": "So this is the strangest one.", "label": []}
{"id": 8252, "text": "This identity quality is the strangest one, because you may think that you're taking <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8253, "text": "But that's not what's intended.", "label": []}

{"id": 8258, "text": "So I've written a bunch of equalities down here, and the only content to them is that these are all different notations for the same thing.", "label": []}
{"id": 8259, "text": "You'll see this notation very commonly.", "label": []}
{"id": 8260, "text": "So for instance the third derivative is <EXPRESSION>, and so on.", "label": []}

{"id": 8263, "text": "Professor: Yes, absolutely.", "label": []}
{"id": 8264, "text": "Or an equally good notation is to write the operator <EXPRESSION>, done three times, to <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}

{"id": 8266, "text": "So I guess I should also write over here when I was talking about <EXPRESSION>, the second derivative, another notation is do the operator <EXPRESSION> twice.", "label": []}
{"id": 8267, "text": "Let's see an example of how this can be applied.", "label": []}
{"id": 8268, "text": "I'll answer this question.", "label": []}
{"id": 8269, "text": "Student: [INAUDIBLE].", "label": []}
{"id": 8270, "text": "Professor: Yeah, so the question is whether the fourth derivative always gives you the original function back, like what happened here.", "label": []}

{"id": 8272, "text": "That's very, very special to sines and cosines.", "label": []}

{"id": 8276, "text": "Let's calculate the nth derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8277, "text": "Okay, <EXPRESSION> is a number, like <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8278, "text": "Here we go.", "label": []}
{"id": 8279, "text": "Let's do this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8280, "text": "So, let's do this bit by bit.", "label": []}
{"id": 8281, "text": "What's the first derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8282, "text": "So everybody knows this.", "label": []}
{"id": 8283, "text": "I'm just using a new notation, this capital D notation.", "label": []}
{"id": 8284, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8285, "text": "Now know, by the way, <EXPRESSION> could be a negative number for that, but for now, for this application, I wanna take <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and so on; one of those numbers.", "label": []}
{"id": 8286, "text": "Okay, we did one derivative.", "label": []}
{"id": 8287, "text": "Let's compute the second derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8288, "text": "Well there's this <EXPRESSION> constant that comes out, and then the exponent comes down, and it gets reduced by <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8289, "text": "All right?", "label": []}
{"id": 8290, "text": "Should I do one more?", "label": []}
{"id": 8291, "text": "<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8292, "text": "That's the constant from here.", "label": []}
{"id": 8293, "text": "Times that exponent, <EXPRESSION> less, <EXPRESSION> is the new exponent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8294, "text": "Well, I keep on going until I come to a new blackboard.", "label": []}
{"id": 8295, "text": "Now, I think I'm going to stop when I get to the <EXPRESSION> minus first derivative, so we can see what's likely to happen.", "label": []}
{"id": 8296, "text": "So when I took the third derivative, I had the <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8297, "text": "And when I took the second derivative, I had the second power of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8298, "text": "So, I think what'll happen when I have the n minus first derivative is I'll have the first power of <EXPRESSION> left over.", "label": []}
{"id": 8299, "text": "The powers of <EXPRESSION> keep coming down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8300, "text": "And what I've done it <EXPRESSION> times, I get the first power.", "label": []}
{"id": 8301, "text": "And then I get a big constant out in front here times more and more and more of these smaller and smaller integers that come down.", "label": []}
{"id": 8302, "text": "What's the last integer that came down before I got <EXPRESSION> here?", "label": []}
{"id": 8303, "text": "Well, let's see.", "label": []}
{"id": 8304, "text": "It's just <EXPRESSION>, because this <EXPRESSION> occurred as the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8305, "text": "And the coefficient in front of that is <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8306, "text": "So that's what you get.", "label": []}
{"id": 8307, "text": "The numbers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and so on down to <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8308, "text": "And now we can differentiate one more time and calculate what <EXPRESSION> is.", "label": []}
{"id": 8309, "text": "So I get the same number, <EXPRESSION> and so on and so on, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8310, "text": "And then I guess I'll say times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8311, "text": "Times, what's the derivative of <EQUATION>, so times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8312, "text": "Time <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8313, "text": "Where this one means the constant function <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8314, "text": "Does anyone know what this number is called?", "label": []}
{"id": 8315, "text": "That has a name.", "label": []}
{"id": 8316, "text": "It's called <EXPRESSION> factorial.", "label": []}
{"id": 8317, "text": "And it's written <EXPRESSION> exclamation point.", "label": []}
{"id": 8318, "text": "And we just used an example of mathematical induction.", "label": []}
{"id": 8319, "text": "So the end result is <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8320, "text": "Okay that's a neat fact.", "label": []}
{"id": 8321, "text": "Final question for the lecture is what's <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>?", "label": []}
{"id": 8322, "text": "Ha.", "label": []}
{"id": 8323, "text": "Excellent.", "label": []}
{"id": 8324, "text": "It's the derivative of a constant.", "label": []}
{"id": 8325, "text": "So it's <EXPRESSION>.", "label": []}
{"id": 8326, "text": "Okay.", "label": []}
