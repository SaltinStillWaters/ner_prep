{"id": 8624, "text": "And however complex the function is, a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients, we're stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8625, "text": "But the big advantage of his method, notice, is that although we've had to find star, we had to find this formula star, and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically, by the way, which we'll learn later, so there's a good method for doing it numerically.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8626, "text": "Although we had to find star, we never had to differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8627, "text": "We had a fast way of getting the slope.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8628, "text": "So we had to know what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}]}

{"id": 8648, "text": "Now we have to do something more here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8649, "text": "So I claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8650, "text": "But really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8651, "text": "So this implicit differentiation method has one very, very important application to finding inverse functions, or finding derivatives of inverse functions.", "entities": []}

{"id": 9083, "text": "So I claim that on the whole, calculus gets a bad rap, that it's actually easier than most things.", "entities": []}

{"id": 9116, "text": "Well, we're gonna have to pick a point and give it a name.", "entities": []}
{"id": 9117, "text": "And since we need a number, we're gonna have to do more than geometry.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13503, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13504, "text": "Good answer.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13505, "text": "It's the other branch of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13506, "text": "So what's actually happening is in disguise, there's another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13507, "text": "Now, that is consistent with these algebraic equations.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13508, "text": "The algebraic equation that I got here doesn't say which branch of the hyperbola I've got.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13509, "text": "It's actually got two branches.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13510, "text": "And the curve really was, in disguise, capturing both of them.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13511, "text": "I want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13512, "text": "Because this is a really beautiful connection.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13513, "text": "And I want to make that connection in connection also with this example.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13514, "text": "The hyperbolas, as you probably know, are the trajectories of comets.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13516, "text": "But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13517, "text": "That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13518, "text": "And what happens when you get the ellipses as well.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13519, "text": "Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 13520, "text": "And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13521, "text": "So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13522, "text": "And pretty much any other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13523, "text": "I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13524, "text": "So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13525, "text": "And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13526, "text": "Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13527, "text": "Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13528, "text": "The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13529, "text": "So in = areas, this is amount of area.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13530, "text": "So this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this, its speed varies.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13531, "text": "And it's speed varies according to a very specific rule.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13532, "text": "Namely, this one here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13533, "text": "And this rule was observed by Kepler.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13534, "text": "But if you have this connection here, we also have something else.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13535, "text": "We also know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 13536, "text": "So that's this formula here, formally dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}

{"id": 13539, "text": "And that means, this quantity here is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13540, "text": "And this is one of the key insights that physicists had, long after Kepler made his physical observations, they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all, because it's a frictionless setup.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13542, "text": "Nothing is going on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13543, "text": "This is what's known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13544, "text": "This is the expression for angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13545, "text": "And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13546, "text": "Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13547, "text": "Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13548, "text": "And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13549, "text": "And it's exactly this polar formula here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13550, "text": "So that's a neat thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13551, "text": "And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13552, "text": "So that's it for generalities and a little pep talk on what's coming up to you when you learn a little more physics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13553, "text": "Right now we need to talk about the exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13554, "text": "So first of all, let me tell you what the topics are.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13555, "text": "They're the same as last year's test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13556, "text": "Which you can take a look at.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13557, "text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13558, "text": "So what did we do?", "entities": []}
{"id": 13559, "text": "One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13560, "text": "And there are three, which we will test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13561, "text": "One is trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13562, "text": "One is integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13563, "text": "And one is partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13564, "text": "So that's more than half of the exam, right there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13565, "text": "The other half of the exam is parametric curves.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13566, "text": "Arc length.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13567, "text": "These are all interrelated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13568, "text": "And area of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13569, "text": "Those are the only kind that we can handle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13570, "text": "Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13571, "text": "And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13572, "text": "And area in polar coordinates, including area.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13573, "text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13574, "text": "That's what's on the test, there are six problems.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13575, "text": "They're very similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13576, "text": "Well, they're not actually that similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13577, "text": "But they're somewhat similar to last year's.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13578, "text": "I'd say the test is similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13579, "text": "Maybe a tiny bit more difficult.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13580, "text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13581, "text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13582, "text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13583, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question was, we didn't do arc length in polar coordinates, did we?", "entities": []}
{"id": 13584, "text": "And the answer is no, we did not.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13585, "text": "We did not do arc length in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13586, "text": "When I give you an exercise, I'm going to ask you about, if you know the speed of a comet here, what's the speed of the comet there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13587, "text": "And we'll have to know about arc length for that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13588, "text": "But we're not doing it on this exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13589, "text": "Other questions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13590, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will I expect you to know <EXPRESSION> =--- so let's see if I can formulate this question.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"id": 13591, "text": "It's related to this four-leaf rose here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13592, "text": "So the question is, suppose I gave you something that looked like this.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13593, "text": "Would I expect you to be able to know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13594, "text": "I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13595, "text": "I can give you a long time to sketch this out.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13596, "text": "And think about what it does.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13597, "text": "Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13598, "text": "And then you have some clue as to what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13599, "text": "It doesn't have six.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13600, "text": "Because of some weird thing, having to do with repetitions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13601, "text": "But the odds and evens work differently.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13602, "text": "So, in fact I would have to tell you what the picture looks like, if it's going to be this complicated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13603, "text": "Similarly, so this is an important point to make, when we come to techniques of integration, any integral that you have, I'm not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13604, "text": "But if it's an integral that I think you're going to get stuck on, either I'm going to give you a hint, tell you how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13605, "text": "Or I'm going to tell you, don't do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13606, "text": "If I tell you don't do it, don't try to do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13607, "text": "It may be impossible.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13608, "text": "And even if it's possible, it's going to be very long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13609, "text": "Like an hour.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13610, "text": "So don't do it unless I tell you to.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13611, "text": "On the other hand, all of these setups in this second half of this unit, they involve somehow setting something up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13612, "text": "And they're basically three issues.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13613, "text": "One is what the integrand is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13614, "text": "One is what the lower limit is, what is the upper limit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13615, "text": "They're just three things, three inputs, to setting up an integral.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13616, "text": "All integrals, this is going to be the setup for all of them.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13617, "text": "And then the second step is evaluating.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13618, "text": "Which really is what we did in the first half here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13619, "text": "And, unfortunately, we don't have infinitely many techniques and indeed there's some integrals that can't be evaluated and some that are too long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13620, "text": "So we'll just try to avoid those.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13621, "text": "I'm not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13622, "text": "Alright, other questions.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13624, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will the percentages be the same.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5286, "text": "The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5288, "text": "And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5289, "text": "OK, and so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant to physics when you find <EQUATION>; that's the (a) that you have in mind here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5290, "text": "It's a vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5291, "text": "Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5292, "text": "I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5293, "text": "But, in general, that's not quite the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5294, "text": "So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5299, "text": "So, the acceleration vector is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5300, "text": "So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"id": 5301, "text": "Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"id": 5302, "text": "So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5303, "text": "It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5304, "text": "So, my point is not moving at that particular time.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5307, "text": "Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5308, "text": "OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 227, "end_offset": 239}]}
{"id": 5309, "text": "OK, any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5310, "text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5311, "text": "OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5312, "text": "One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"id": 5313, "text": "OK, this is completely false.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5314, "text": "And, they are really not the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5315, "text": "So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5316, "text": "If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5317, "text": "And, you can get there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5318, "text": "But, it will not be a very nice expression.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5319, "text": "There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5320, "text": "Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5321, "text": "What's more relevant might be this one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5322, "text": "This is actually the speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5323, "text": "This one, I don't know what it means.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5324, "text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5325, "text": "So, let's continue our exploration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5326, "text": "So, the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5327, "text": "So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5328, "text": "So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5329, "text": "And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5330, "text": "So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"id": 5331, "text": "I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"id": 5332, "text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 5333, "text": "And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5334, "text": "Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5335, "text": "In general, maybe you would say you start at time, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5336, "text": "But, it's a convention.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5337, "text": "If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5338, "text": "I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 147}]}
{"id": 5339, "text": "I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5340, "text": "Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5341, "text": "So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5342, "text": "Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5343, "text": "Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5344, "text": "OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5345, "text": "And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5426, "text": "OK, so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because, after all, a lot of what's here you can just do in coordinates.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5428, "text": "Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5429, "text": "So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5430, "text": "So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 5431, "text": "So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5432, "text": "But, still I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5433, "text": "So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5434, "text": "Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5435, "text": "But maybe it's more complicated than that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5436, "text": "We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5437, "text": "They have more and more complicated theories.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5438, "text": "And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5439, "text": "So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5440, "text": "So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5441, "text": "And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5442, "text": "Sorry, is swept at constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5443, "text": "From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5444, "text": "OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5445, "text": "OK, so let me explain again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5446, "text": "So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5447, "text": "Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5448, "text": "So, this is supposed to be light blue.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5449, "text": "Can you see that it's different from white?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5450, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5451, "text": "OK, me neither.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5452, "text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, it doesn't really matter.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5453, "text": "So, the planet moves on its orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5454, "text": "And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5455, "text": "Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5456, "text": "And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5457, "text": "So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5458, "text": "And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5459, "text": "So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5460, "text": "And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5461, "text": "But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5462, "text": "So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5463, "text": "That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5464, "text": "So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5465, "text": "And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5466, "text": "At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5467, "text": "So, let's try to see, what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5468, "text": "OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5469, "text": "Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5470, "text": "So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5471, "text": "OK, so let's start with the first step.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5472, "text": "What's the most complicated thing in here?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5473, "text": "It's this area swept out by the line.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5474, "text": "How do we express that area in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5475, "text": "Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5476, "text": "If I take a sufficiently small amount of time, this shaded part looks like a triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5477, "text": "So, we have to find the area of the triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5478, "text": "Well, we know how to do that now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5479, "text": "So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5480, "text": "And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5481, "text": "OK, so, I should say, this is the area swept in time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"id": 5482, "text": "You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 5483, "text": "I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5484, "text": "So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"id": 5485, "text": "So, let's use that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5486, "text": "Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"id": 5487, "text": "I can take out the <EXPRESSION>, which is scalar.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 5488, "text": "So, now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5489, "text": "It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"id": 5490, "text": "So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 91}]}

{"id": 5495, "text": "Yes, let me try to explain that again.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6765, "text": "And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6766, "text": "It will have several critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6767, "text": "So, this example here, well, you see on the plot that there is two maxima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6768, "text": "And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6769, "text": "And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6770, "text": "On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6771, "text": "And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6772, "text": "It crosses itself.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6773, "text": "And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 48}]}

{"id": 6775, "text": "So, you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6776, "text": "So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6777, "text": "Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6778, "text": "So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6779, "text": "So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6780, "text": "So, and, in fact, why do we care?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6781, "text": "Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a function?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6782, "text": "So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6784, "text": "Well, we have two obvious candidates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6785, "text": "We have this local maximum and that local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6786, "text": "And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6787, "text": "Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6788, "text": "But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6789, "text": "Well, four wins.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6790, "text": "The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6791, "text": "So, where's the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6792, "text": "Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6793, "text": "So, that's another feature.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6794, "text": "The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6795, "text": "It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6796, "text": "So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6797, "text": "So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6798, "text": "So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6799, "text": "And so, we have to try both.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6800, "text": "OK, but so we'll get back to that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6801, "text": "For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6802, "text": "So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6803, "text": "And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6804, "text": "If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6805, "text": "And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6806, "text": "And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6807, "text": "So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6808, "text": "But, it will again involve the second derivative.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6882, "text": "So, it will be a negative quantity.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6887, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6888, "text": "So, if you want, what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates called <EQUATION>, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the difference of squares directly.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6889, "text": "OK, so that's the first case.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6890, "text": "The second case is where <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}

{"id": 6892, "text": "Then it means that this term over there goes away.", "entities": []}

{"id": 7002, "text": "OK, so that's another way to derive the same answer.", "entities": []}
{"id": 7003, "text": "And now, you see here why the discriminate plays a role.", "entities": []}
