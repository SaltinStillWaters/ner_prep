{"id": 8330, "text": "Thank you for entertaining my colleague, Haynes Miller.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8331, "text": "So, today we're going to continue where he started, namely what he talked about was the chain rule, which is probably the most powerful technique for extending the kinds of functions that you can differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8332, "text": "And we're going to use the chain rule in some rather clever algebraic ways today.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"id": 8333, "text": "So the topic for today is what's known as implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8334, "text": "So implicit differentiation is a technique that allows you to differentiate a lot of functions you didn't even know how to find before.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8335, "text": "And it's a technique - let's wait for a few people to sit down here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8336, "text": "Physics, huh?", "entities": []}
{"id": 8337, "text": "Okay, more Physics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8338, "text": "Let's take a break.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8339, "text": "You can get those after class.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8340, "text": "All right, so we're talking about implicit differentiation, and I'm going to illustrate it by several examples.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8341, "text": "So this is one of the most important and basic formulas that we've already covered part way.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8342, "text": "Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"id": 8343, "text": "Now, what we've got so far is the exponents, <EXPRESSION>, etc.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"id": 8344, "text": "You did the positive integer powers in the first lecture, and then yesterday Professor Miller told you about the negative powers.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8345, "text": "So what we're going to do right now, today, is we're going to consider the exponents which are rational numbers, ratios of integers.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8346, "text": "So a is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 8347, "text": "<EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are integers.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"id": 8348, "text": "All right, so that's our goal for right now, and we're going to use this method of implicit differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8349, "text": "In particular, it's important to realize that this covers the case <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 8350, "text": "And those are the nth roots.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8351, "text": "So when we take the <EXPRESSION>, we're going to cover that right now, along with many other examples.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 8352, "text": "So this is our first example.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8353, "text": "So how do we get started?", "entities": []}
{"id": 8354, "text": "Well we just write down a formula for the function.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"id": 8355, "text": "The function is <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"id": 8356, "text": "That's what we're trying to deal with.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8357, "text": "And now there's really only two steps.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8358, "text": "The first step is to take this equation to the nth power, so write it <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"id": 8359, "text": "Alright, so that's just the same equation re-written.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8360, "text": "And now, what we're going to do is we're going to differentiate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8361, "text": "So we're going to apply <EXPRESSION> to the equation.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"id": 8362, "text": "Now why is it that we can apply it to the second equation, not the first equation?", "entities": []}
{"id": 8363, "text": "So maybe I should call these equation <EXPRESSION> and equation <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"id": 8364, "text": "So, the point is, we can apply it to equation <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"id": 8365, "text": "Now, the reason is that we don't know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 58}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"id": 8366, "text": "That's something we just don't know yet.", "entities": []}

{"id": 8368, "text": "Those are the things that we took care of before.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8369, "text": "So now we're in shape to be able to do the differentiation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8370, "text": "So I'm going to write it out explicitly over here, without carrying it out just yet.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 8371, "text": "That's <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"id": 8372, "text": "And now you see this expression here requires us to do something we couldn't do before yesterday.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8373, "text": "Namely, this <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"id": 8374, "text": "So we have to apply the chain rule here.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 8375, "text": "So this is the same as - this is by the chain rule now - <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"id": 8376, "text": "And then, on the right hand side, we can just carry it out.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8377, "text": "We know the formula.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8378, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"id": 8379, "text": "Right, now this is our scheme.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8380, "text": "And you'll see in a minute why we win with this.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8381, "text": "So, first of all, there are two factors here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8382, "text": "One of them is unknown.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8383, "text": "In fact, it's what we're looking for.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8384, "text": "But the other one is going to be a known quantity, because we know how to differentiate <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 100}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"id": 8385, "text": "That's the same formula, although the letter has been changed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8386, "text": "And so this is the same as - I'll write it underneath here - <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"id": 8387, "text": "Okay, now comes, if you like, the non-calculus part of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8388, "text": "Remember the non-calculus part of the problem is always the messier part of the problem.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8389, "text": "So we want to figure out this formula.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8390, "text": "This formula, the answer over here, which maybe I'll put in a box now, has this expressed much more simply, only in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 125, "end_offset": 137}]}
{"id": 8391, "text": "And what we have to do now is just solve for <EXPRESSION> using algebra, and then solve all the way in terms of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 112, "end_offset": 124}]}

{"id": 8393, "text": "So I do that by dividing the factor on the left-hand side.", "entities": []}
