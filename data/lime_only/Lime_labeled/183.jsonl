{"id": 13504, "text": "Good answer.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13505, "text": "It's the other branch of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13506, "text": "So what's actually happening is in disguise, there's another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13508, "text": "The algebraic equation that I got here doesn't say which branch of the hyperbola I've got.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13509, "text": "It's actually got two branches.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13510, "text": "And the curve really was, in disguise, capturing both of them.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13511, "text": "I want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13512, "text": "Because this is a really beautiful connection.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13514, "text": "The hyperbolas, as you probably know, are the trajectories of comets.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13516, "text": "But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13517, "text": "That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13518, "text": "And what happens when you get the ellipses as well.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13519, "text": "Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 13520, "text": "And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13521, "text": "So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13522, "text": "And pretty much any other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13523, "text": "I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13524, "text": "So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13525, "text": "And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13526, "text": "Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13527, "text": "Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13528, "text": "The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13529, "text": "So in = areas, this is amount of area.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13530, "text": "So this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this, its speed varies.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13531, "text": "And it's speed varies according to a very specific rule.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13532, "text": "Namely, this one here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13533, "text": "And this rule was observed by Kepler.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13534, "text": "But if you have this connection here, we also have something else.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13535, "text": "We also know that <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 13536, "text": "So that's this formula here, formally dividing by <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"id": 13537, "text": "That's the rate of change with respect to this time parameter, which is the honest to goodness time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13538, "text": "Real physical time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13539, "text": "And that means, this quantity here is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13540, "text": "And this is one of the key insights that physicists had, long after Kepler made his physical observations, they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all, because it's a frictionless setup.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13541, "text": "Outer space, there's no air.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13542, "text": "Nothing is going on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13543, "text": "This is what's known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13544, "text": "This is the expression for angular momentum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13545, "text": "And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13546, "text": "Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13547, "text": "Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13548, "text": "And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13549, "text": "And it's exactly this polar formula here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13550, "text": "So that's a neat thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13551, "text": "And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13552, "text": "So that's it for generalities and a little pep talk on what's coming up to you when you learn a little more physics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13553, "text": "Right now we need to talk about the exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13554, "text": "So first of all, let me tell you what the topics are.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13555, "text": "They're the same as last year's test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13556, "text": "Which you can take a look at.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13557, "text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13558, "text": "So what did we do?", "entities": []}
{"id": 13559, "text": "One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13560, "text": "And there are three, which we will test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13561, "text": "One is trig substitution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13562, "text": "One is integration by parts.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13563, "text": "And one is partial fractions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13564, "text": "So that's more than half of the exam, right there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13565, "text": "The other half of the exam is parametric curves.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13566, "text": "Arc length.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13567, "text": "These are all interrelated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13568, "text": "And area of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13569, "text": "Those are the only kind that we can handle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13570, "text": "Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13571, "text": "And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13572, "text": "And area in polar coordinates, including area.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13573, "text": "That's it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13574, "text": "That's what's on the test, there are six problems.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13575, "text": "They're very similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13576, "text": "Well, they're not actually that similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13577, "text": "But they're somewhat similar to last year's.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13578, "text": "I'd say the test is similar.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13579, "text": "Maybe a tiny bit more difficult.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13580, "text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13581, "text": "We'll see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13582, "text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13583, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question was, we didn't do arc length in polar coordinates, did we?", "entities": []}
{"id": 13584, "text": "And the answer is no, we did not.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13585, "text": "We did not do arc length in polar coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13586, "text": "When I give you an exercise, I'm going to ask you about, if you know the speed of a comet here, what's the speed of the comet there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13587, "text": "And we'll have to know about arc length for that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13588, "text": "But we're not doing it on this exam.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13589, "text": "Other questions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13590, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will I expect you to know <EXPRESSION> =--- so let's see if I can formulate this question.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"id": 13591, "text": "It's related to this four-leaf rose here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13592, "text": "So the question is, suppose I gave you something that looked like this.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13593, "text": "Would I expect you to be able to know what it is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13594, "text": "I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13595, "text": "I can give you a long time to sketch this out.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13596, "text": "And think about what it does.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13597, "text": "Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13598, "text": "And then you have some clue as to what it's doing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13599, "text": "It doesn't have six.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13600, "text": "Because of some weird thing, having to do with repetitions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13601, "text": "But the odds and evens work differently.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13602, "text": "So, in fact I would have to tell you what the picture looks like, if it's going to be this complicated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13603, "text": "Similarly, so this is an important point to make, when we come to techniques of integration, any integral that you have, I'm not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13604, "text": "But if it's an integral that I think you're going to get stuck on, either I'm going to give you a hint, tell you how to do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13605, "text": "Or I'm going to tell you, don't do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13606, "text": "If I tell you don't do it, don't try to do it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13607, "text": "It may be impossible.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13608, "text": "And even if it's possible, it's going to be very long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13609, "text": "Like an hour.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13610, "text": "So don't do it unless I tell you to.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13611, "text": "On the other hand, all of these setups in this second half of this unit, they involve somehow setting something up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13612, "text": "And they're basically three issues.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13613, "text": "One is what the integrand is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13614, "text": "One is what the lower limit is, what is the upper limit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13615, "text": "They're just three things, three inputs, to setting up an integral.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13616, "text": "All integrals, this is going to be the setup for all of them.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13617, "text": "And then the second step is evaluating.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13618, "text": "Which really is what we did in the first half here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13619, "text": "And, unfortunately, we don't have infinitely many techniques and indeed there's some integrals that can't be evaluated and some that are too long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13620, "text": "So we'll just try to avoid those.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13621, "text": "I'm not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13622, "text": "Alright, other questions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13623, "text": "Yes.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13624, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question is, will the percentages be the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13625, "text": "And the answer is, no.", "entities": []}
