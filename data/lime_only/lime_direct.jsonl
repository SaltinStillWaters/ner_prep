{"id":64156,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64157,"text":"Now, this is the method which is called cover-up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64158,"text":"But it's really carried out much, much faster than this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64159,"text":"So I'm going to review the method and I'm going to show you what it is in general.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64160,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> step is to factor the denominator, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":9364,"label":"expression","start_offset":55,"end_offset":67},{"id":9365,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":37},{"id":9366,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":42,"end_offset":53}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64165,"text":"And that's where I knew what I was aiming for in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64167,"text":"That is, what the unknowns should be and what target, simplified expression, we're aiming for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64168,"text":"So that's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64169,"text":"And then the <EXPRESSION> step is what I'll now call cover-up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64170,"text":"Which is just a very fast way of doing what I did on this last board, which is solving for the unknown coefficients.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64172,"text":"Over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64174,"text":"Handwriting it makes it much faster.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64177,"text":"Alright, that's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64181,"text":"And I'm just going to do it directly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64182,"text":"So let me show you what the method consists of visually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64183,"text":"I'm going to cover up, that is, knock out this factor, and focus on this number here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64186,"text":"To this left-hand side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64187,"text":"And what I get is <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":9379,"label":"equation","start_offset":18,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64188,"text":"Now, that's the same thing I did over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64189,"text":"I just did it by skipping the intermediate algebra step, which is a lot of writing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64190,"text":"So the cover-up method really amounts to the following thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64191,"text":"I'm thinking of multiplying this over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64192,"text":"It cancels this and it gets rid of everything else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64194,"text":"And I have to get rid of it on this side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64195,"text":"So in other words, by eliminating this, I'm isolating a on the right-hand side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64196,"text":"So the cover-up is that I'm covering this and getting <EXPRESSION> out of it.","entities":[{"id":9381,"label":"expression","start_offset":54,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64197,"text":"Similarly, I can do the same thing with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":9382,"label":"expression","start_offset":40,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64198,"text":"It's focused on the value <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":9383,"label":"equation","start_offset":26,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64199,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is what I'm getting on the right-hand side.","entities":[{"id":9384,"label":"expression","start_offset":4,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64200,"text":"And then I have to cover up this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64201,"text":"So if I cover up that, then what's left over with <EQUATION> is again, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":9385,"label":"equation","start_offset":50,"end_offset":60},{"id":9386,"label":"expression","start_offset":71,"end_offset":83}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64202,"text":"So this is the way the method gets carried out in practice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64203,"text":"Writing, essentially, the least you can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64204,"text":"Now, when you get to several variables, it becomes just way more convenient to do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64205,"text":"So now, let me just review when cover-up works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64207,"text":"And, so you need <EXPRESSION> things here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64208,"text":"It has to factor completely, the denominator has to factor completely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64209,"text":"And the degree of the numerator has to be strictly less than the degree of the denominator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64210,"text":"I'm going to give you an example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64211,"text":"So, for instance, and this tells you the general pattern of the setup also.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64212,"text":"Say you had <EXPRESSION>, let's say.","entities":[{"id":9389,"label":"expression","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":9390,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":11}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64214,"text":"So here I'm going to tell you the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64216,"text":"And it will always break up into something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64217,"text":"So however many factors you have, you'll have to put in a term for each of those.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64218,"text":"And then you can find each number here by this cover-up method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64219,"text":"Now we're done with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64220,"text":"And now we have to go on to the algebraic complications.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64222,"text":"It would be repeated roots or repeated factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65422,"text":"If you spin the parabola around, you get this kind of shape, this kind of solid shape here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65423,"text":"Now, I'm going to use the same kind of slicing that I did before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65428,"text":"This time it's not a disk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65429,"text":"Actually, if I revolve this around the other way, it would have had a hole in it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65430,"text":"Which is also possible to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65431,"text":"That's practically the same as the method of disks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65433,"text":"Anyway, we're going to revolve it around this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65434,"text":"So again, I need to sweep it around, swing it around like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65435,"text":"And I'll draw the shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65436,"text":"It's going to sweep around in a circle and maybe it'll have a little bit of thickness to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65443,"text":"Very thin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65460,"text":"Now, the last bit that I have to do, I claim, in order to figure this out, is the circumference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65612,"text":"Right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65637,"text":"I had in mind this big vat here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65638,"text":"And this distance here is <EXPRESSION> meter, and then the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":10578,"label":"expression","start_offset":26,"end_offset":38},{"id":10579,"label":"expression","start_offset":59,"end_offset":71},{"id":10580,"label":"expression","start_offset":75,"end_offset":87}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65641,"text":"Now, it's not that crazy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65642,"text":"And in fact it's easy to check that, it's pretty reasonable in terms of scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65652,"text":"This is the correct answer to the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66930,"text":"Right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66931,"text":"The lowest value of the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66933,"text":"Now, the problem with this question and you will, so that refers to the minimum value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66934,"text":"But then there's this other question which is where is the minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66935,"text":"And the answer to that is <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":11760,"label":"equation","start_offset":26,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66937,"text":"So they're <EXPRESSION> separate things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66938,"text":"Now, the problem is that people are sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66939,"text":"And especially since you usually find the critical point <EXPRESSION>, and the value that is plugging in for a <EXPRESSION>, people will stop short and they'll give the wrong answer to the question, for instance.","entities":[{"id":11764,"label":"expression","start_offset":57,"end_offset":69},{"id":11765,"label":"expression","start_offset":111,"end_offset":123}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66946,"text":"But it's just wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66947,"text":"And when people ask this question, they're being sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66948,"text":"Anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66949,"text":"They should maybe be a little clearer and say what's the minimum value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66950,"text":"Or, where is the value achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66951,"text":"It's achieved at, or where is the minimum value achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66953,"text":"So that it has an unambiguous answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66954,"text":"And when people ask you for the minimum point, they're also - so why is it that we call it the minimum point?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66955,"text":"We have this word, critical point, which is what <EQUATION> is in critical value.","entities":[{"id":11768,"label":"equation","start_offset":49,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66956,"text":"And so I'm making those same distinctions here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66957,"text":"But there's another notion of a minimum point, and this is an alternative if you like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66959,"text":"Right, that's a point on the graph.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66960,"text":"It's the point - well, so that graph is way up there, but I'll just put it on there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66961,"text":"That's this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66962,"text":"And you might say min there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66963,"text":"And you might point to this point, and you might say max.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66964,"text":"And similarly, this <EXPRESSION> might be a max.","entities":[{"id":11771,"label":"expression","start_offset":20,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66965,"text":"So in other words, what this means is simply that people are a little sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66966,"text":"And sometimes they mean <EXPRESSION> thing and sometimes they mean another.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66968,"text":"Yeah?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66969,"text":"OK, so that's a good - very good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66970,"text":"So here we go, find the largest area enclosed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66971,"text":"So that's sort of a trick question, isn't it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66972,"text":"So there are various - that's a good thing to ask.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66973,"text":"That's sort of a trick question, why?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66974,"text":"Because according to the rules, we're trapped between the <EXPRESSION> maxima at something which is strictly below.","entities":[{"id":11774,"label":"expression","start_offset":58,"end_offset":70}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66975,"text":"So in other words, <EXPRESSION> answer to this question would be, and this is the answer that I would probably give, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":11775,"label":"expression","start_offset":19,"end_offset":31},{"id":11776,"label":"expression","start_offset":120,"end_offset":132}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66980,"text":"Which breaks the rules of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66981,"text":"So, essentially, it's a trick question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66982,"text":"But I would answer it this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66983,"text":"Because that's the most interesting part of the answer, which is that it's <EXPRESSION> and it occurs really when <EXPRESSION> of the squares disappears to nothing.","entities":[{"id":11782,"label":"expression","start_offset":75,"end_offset":87},{"id":11783,"label":"expression","start_offset":114,"end_offset":126}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66984,"text":"So now, let's do another example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66986,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66987,"text":"The question is, since the question was, what was the largest area, why did we find the least area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66988,"text":"The reason is that when we go about our procedure of looking for the least, or the most, we'll automatically find both.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66989,"text":"Because we don't know which <EXPRESSION> is which until we compare values.","entities":[{"id":11786,"label":"expression","start_offset":28,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66990,"text":"And actually, it's much more to your advantage to figure out both the maximum and minimum whenever you answer such a question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66991,"text":"Because otherwise you won't understand the behavior of the function very well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66992,"text":"So, the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66995,"text":"We answered the question of what the largest and the smallest value was.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66996,"text":"Also, I'm wondering if you can check both the minimum  approaches .","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66997,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66998,"text":"<EXPRESSION> can also use, the question is, can we use the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.","entities":[{"id":11789,"label":"expression","start_offset":0,"end_offset":12},{"id":11790,"label":"expression","start_offset":59,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66999,"text":"And the answer is, yes we can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67000,"text":"In fact, you can actually also stare at this and see that it's a sum of squares.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67001,"text":"So it's always curving up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67002,"text":"It's a parabola with a positive <EXPRESSION> coefficient.","entities":[{"id":11791,"label":"expression","start_offset":32,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67003,"text":"So you can differentiate this twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67010,"text":"So again, this is going to be another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67011,"text":"The question is, when I say minimum or maximum point which will I mean.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67012,"text":"So I just repeated the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67013,"text":"So the question is, when I say minimum point, what will I mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67014,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67015,"text":"And the answer is that for the purposes of this class I will probably avoid saying that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67016,"text":"But I will say, probably, where is the minimum achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67018,"text":"If I actually sat at I often am referring to the graph, and I mean this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67020,"text":"And I'll make this very clear when we were doing this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67021,"text":"However, I just want to prepare you for the fact that in real life, and even me when I'm talking colloquially, when I say what's the minimum point of something, I might actually be mixing it up with this other notion here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67022,"text":"So let's do another example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
