{"id": 8618, "text": "Now, so let me just make two points about this, which are just philosophical points for you right now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8619, "text": "The first is, when I promised you at the beginning of this class that we were going to be able to differentiate any function you know, I meant it very literally.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8620, "text": "What I meant is if you know the function, we'll be able give a formula for the derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8621, "text": "If you don't know how to find a function, you'll have a lot of trouble finding the derivative.", "entities": []}

{"id": 8623, "text": "That will never happen.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8624, "text": "And however complex the function is, a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients, we're stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8625, "text": "But the big advantage of his method, notice, is that although we've had to find star, we had to find this formula star, and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically, by the way, which we'll learn later, so there's a good method for doing it numerically.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8626, "text": "Although we had to find star, we never had to differentiate it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8627, "text": "We had a fast way of getting the slope.", "entities": []}

{"id": 8648, "text": "Now we have to do something more here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8649, "text": "So I claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know.", "entities": []}
{"id": 8650, "text": "But really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13505, "text": "It's the other branch of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13516, "text": "But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13517, "text": "That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13518, "text": "And what happens when you get the ellipses as well.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13519, "text": "Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 13520, "text": "And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13521, "text": "So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13522, "text": "And pretty much any other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13523, "text": "I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13524, "text": "So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13525, "text": "And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13526, "text": "Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13528, "text": "The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13529, "text": "So in = areas, this is amount of area.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13532, "text": "Namely, this one here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13533, "text": "And this rule was observed by Kepler.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13545, "text": "And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13546, "text": "Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13547, "text": "Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13548, "text": "And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13549, "text": "And it's exactly this polar formula here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13550, "text": "So that's a neat thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13551, "text": "And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13555, "text": "They're the same as last year's test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13556, "text": "Which you can take a look at.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13557, "text": "And let's see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13558, "text": "So what did we do?", "entities": []}
{"id": 13559, "text": "One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13560, "text": "And there are three, which we will test.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13563, "text": "And one is partial fractions.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13570, "text": "Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13571, "text": "And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13582, "text": "Yeah.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13583, "text": "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR: The question was, we didn't do arc length in polar coordinates, did we?", "entities": []}

{"id": 13591, "text": "It's related to this four-leaf rose here.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13594, "text": "I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13595, "text": "I can give you a long time to sketch this out.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13596, "text": "And think about what it does.", "entities": []}
{"id": 13597, "text": "Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.", "entities": []}

{"id": 13599, "text": "It doesn't have six.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5276, "text": "Anyway, that's a formula we can get.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5277, "text": "OK, now, what about acceleration?", "entities": []}

{"id": 5283, "text": "There is some force being exerted.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5285, "text": "So, the definition will take effect.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5286, "text": "The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5288, "text": "And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5289, "text": "OK, and so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant to physics when you find <EQUATION>; that's the (a) that you have in mind here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5290, "text": "It's a vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5291, "text": "Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5292, "text": "I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5293, "text": "But, in general, that's not quite the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5294, "text": "So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5295, "text": "If we take the example of the cycloid, well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}

{"id": 5298, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"id": 5299, "text": "So, the acceleration vector is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5300, "text": "So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"id": 5301, "text": "Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"id": 5302, "text": "So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5303, "text": "It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5304, "text": "So, my point is not moving at that particular time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5305, "text": "But, it's accelerating up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5306, "text": "So, that means that actually as it comes down, first it's slowing down.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5307, "text": "Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5308, "text": "OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 227, "end_offset": 239}]}
{"id": 5309, "text": "OK, any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5310, "text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5311, "text": "OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5312, "text": "One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"id": 5313, "text": "OK, this is completely false.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5314, "text": "And, they are really not the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5315, "text": "So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5316, "text": "If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5317, "text": "And, you can get there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5318, "text": "But, it will not be a very nice expression.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5319, "text": "There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5320, "text": "Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5321, "text": "What's more relevant might be this one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5322, "text": "This is actually the speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5323, "text": "This one, I don't know what it means.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5324, "text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5325, "text": "So, let's continue our exploration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5326, "text": "So, the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5327, "text": "So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5328, "text": "So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5329, "text": "And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5330, "text": "So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"id": 5331, "text": "I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"id": 5332, "text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 5333, "text": "And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5334, "text": "Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5335, "text": "In general, maybe you would say you start at time, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5336, "text": "But, it's a convention.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5337, "text": "If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5338, "text": "I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 147}]}
{"id": 5339, "text": "I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5340, "text": "Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5341, "text": "So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5342, "text": "Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5343, "text": "Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5344, "text": "OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5345, "text": "And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5346, "text": "Actually, maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5347, "text": "I mean, you get to choose how you count it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5348, "text": "But, in this case, if you are moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5349, "text": "So -- So if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5350, "text": "So, if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is, you have this nice-looking curve; how long is it?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5351, "text": "Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"id": 5352, "text": "And, to say the truth, I don't really know how to integrate that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5353, "text": "So, we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5354, "text": "However, we'll see one later using a cool trick, and multi-variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5355, "text": "So, for now, we'll just leave the formula like that, and we don't know how long it is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5356, "text": "Well, you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5357, "text": "But, that's the best I can offer.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5358, "text": "Now, another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5359, "text": "So, the usual notation is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 5360, "text": "It has a hat because it's a unit vector, and <EXPRESSION> because it's tangent.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"id": 5361, "text": "Now, how do we get this unit vector?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5362, "text": "So, maybe I should have pointed out before that if you're moving along some trajectory, say you're going in that direction, then when you're at this point, the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5363, "text": "It tells you the direction of motion in particular.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5364, "text": "So, if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is rescale it, so, at its length becomes one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5365, "text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> divided by a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"id": 5366, "text": "So, it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5367, "text": "So, let's see what we can say.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5368, "text": "Well, we can say that <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, so, that's the velocity vector, that's the same thing as if I use the chain rule <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 117}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 132}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 133, "end_offset": 145}]}
{"id": 5369, "text": "OK, so, let's think about this things.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5370, "text": "So, this guy here we've just seen.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5371, "text": "That's the same as the speed, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5372, "text": "So, this one here should be <EXPRESSION> divided by its length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"id": 5373, "text": "So, that means this actually should be the unit vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5374, "text": "OK, so, let me rewrite that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5375, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"id": 5376, "text": "So, maybe if I actually stated directly that way, see, I'm just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5377, "text": "The length is the speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5378, "text": "The direction is tangent to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5379, "text": "So, the speed is <EXPRESSION>, and the vector is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5380, "text": "And, that's how we get this.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5421, "text": "OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5422, "text": "Any other questions?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5423, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5424, "text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5425, "text": "So, what happens next?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5426, "text": "OK, so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because, after all, a lot of what's here you can just do in coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5427, "text": "And, we don't really need vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5428, "text": "Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5429, "text": "So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5430, "text": "So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 5431, "text": "So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5432, "text": "But, still I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5433, "text": "So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5434, "text": "Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5435, "text": "But maybe it's more complicated than that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5436, "text": "We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5437, "text": "They have more and more complicated theories.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5438, "text": "And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5439, "text": "So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5440, "text": "So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5441, "text": "And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5442, "text": "Sorry, is swept at constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5443, "text": "From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5444, "text": "OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5445, "text": "OK, so let me explain again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5446, "text": "So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5447, "text": "Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5448, "text": "So, this is supposed to be light blue.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5449, "text": "Can you see that it's different from white?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5450, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5451, "text": "OK, me neither.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5452, "text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, it doesn't really matter.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5453, "text": "So, the planet moves on its orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5454, "text": "And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5455, "text": "Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5456, "text": "And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5457, "text": "So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5458, "text": "And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5459, "text": "So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5460, "text": "And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5461, "text": "But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5462, "text": "So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5463, "text": "That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5464, "text": "So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5465, "text": "And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5466, "text": "At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5467, "text": "So, let's try to see, what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5468, "text": "OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5469, "text": "Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5470, "text": "So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5471, "text": "OK, so let's start with the first step.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5472, "text": "What's the most complicated thing in here?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5473, "text": "It's this area swept out by the line.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5474, "text": "How do we express that area in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5475, "text": "Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5476, "text": "If I take a sufficiently small amount of time, this shaded part looks like a triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5477, "text": "So, we have to find the area of the triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5478, "text": "Well, we know how to do that now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5479, "text": "So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5480, "text": "And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5481, "text": "OK, so, I should say, this is the area swept in time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"id": 5482, "text": "You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 5483, "text": "I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5484, "text": "So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"id": 5485, "text": "So, let's use that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5486, "text": "Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"id": 5487, "text": "I can take out the <EXPRESSION>, which is scalar.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 5488, "text": "So, now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5489, "text": "It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"id": 5490, "text": "So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 91}]}
{"id": 5491, "text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> has constant length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 5492, "text": "Any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5493, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5494, "text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5495, "text": "Yes, let me try to explain that again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5496, "text": "So, what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross products <EXPRESSION> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"id": 5497, "text": "I should say, with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5498, "text": "How do we see that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5499, "text": "Well, let's take a small time interval, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"id": 5500, "text": "In time, <EXPRESSION>, our planet moves by <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"id": 5501, "text": "So, if it moves by <EXPRESSION>, it means that this triangle up there has two sides.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 5502, "text": "One is the position vector, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"id": 5503, "text": "The other one is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"id": 5504, "text": "So, its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5505, "text": "That's the formula we've seen for the area of a triangle in space.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5506, "text": "So, the area is one half of the cross product, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, magnitude of the cross product.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 5507, "text": "So, to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5508, "text": "Area divided by <EXPRESSION> is constant at our time.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 5509, "text": "And so, this is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5510, "text": "OK, now, what about the other half of the law?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5511, "text": "Well, it says that the motion is in a plane, and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5512, "text": "And, it contains, also, the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5513, "text": "And, it contains the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5514, "text": "So, let's think about that plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5515, "text": "Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5516, "text": "OK, that's what we are saying.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5517, "text": "But, there is another vector that I know it is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5518, "text": "You could say the position vector at another time, or at any time, but in fact, what's also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5519, "text": "OK, if I'm moving in the plane, then position and velocity are in there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5520, "text": "So, the plane of motion contains <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"id": 5521, "text": "So, what's the direction of the cross product <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"id": 5522, "text": "Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5523, "text": "So, it's normal to the plane of motion.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5524, "text": "And, that means, now, that actually we've put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <EXPRESSION> has constant length and constant direction.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"id": 5525, "text": "In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5526, "text": "So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5527, "text": "And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5528, "text": "If you want, it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5529, "text": "Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5530, "text": "It's, however, instant, if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5531, "text": "And, to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5532, "text": "OK, so -- [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] OK, so, Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that <EQUATION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"id": 5533, "text": "That's what the law says.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5534, "text": "So, in terms of derivatives, it means <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"id": 5535, "text": "OK, now, so there's an interesting thing to note, which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions, with dot products or cross products.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5536, "text": "There's only one catch, which is that when we differentiate a cross product, we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5537, "text": "The guy on the right stays on the right.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5538, "text": "OK, so, if you know that <EXPRESSION>, then you are safe.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}]}

{"id": 5540, "text": "OK, so it's the only thing to watch for.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5541, "text": "So, product rule is OK for taking the derivative of a dot product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5542, "text": "There, you don't actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5543, "text": "There you just need to be a little bit more careful.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5544, "text": "OK, so, now that we know that, we can write this as <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"id": 5545, "text": "Well, let's reformulate things slightly.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5546, "text": "So, <EXPRESSION> already has a name.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}

{"id": 5551, "text": "OK, so now what's the next step?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5552, "text": "Well, we know what <EXPRESSION> is because, remember, a vector cross itself is always <EXPRESSION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 75}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 98}]}

{"id": 5554, "text": "And, the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5557, "text": "And, since we know that acceleration is caused by a force that's equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force -- -- is parallel to the position vector, that means, well, if you have the sun here at the origin, and if you have your planets, well, the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5558, "text": "In fact, the law doesn't even say whether it's going towards the sun or away from the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5559, "text": "Well, what we know now is that, of course, the attraction is towards the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5560, "text": "But, Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were going away.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5561, "text": "So, in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6304, "text": "The other way to think about it, the direction in which the value doesn't change is a direction that's tangent to the level surface.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6306, "text": "And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6307, "text": "So, let me just show that on the picture here.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6315, "text": "So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6319, "text": "OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6320, "text": "The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6321, "text": "And, it would be going towards higher values of a function.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6322, "text": "I don't know if you can see the labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6323, "text": "So, it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6324, "text": "OK, so that's it for today.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6756, "text": "So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6757, "text": "So, that's the main topic for today.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6758, "text": "So, remember yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6759, "text": "And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"id": 6760, "text": "That's a point where the partial derivatives are both <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"id": 6761, "text": "And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6762, "text": "There's local minima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6763, "text": "So, maybe I should show the function on this contour plot, there is local maxima, which are like that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6764, "text": "And, there's saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6765, "text": "And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6766, "text": "It will have several critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6767, "text": "So, this example here, well, you see on the plot that there is two maxima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6768, "text": "And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6769, "text": "And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6770, "text": "On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6771, "text": "And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6772, "text": "It crosses itself.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6773, "text": "And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"id": 6774, "text": "Along the x direction, the values will increase.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"id": 6775, "text": "So, you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6776, "text": "So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6777, "text": "Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6778, "text": "So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6779, "text": "So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6780, "text": "So, and, in fact, why do we care?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6781, "text": "Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a function?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6782, "text": "So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6783, "text": "For example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6784, "text": "Well, we have two obvious candidates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6785, "text": "We have this local maximum and that local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6786, "text": "And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6787, "text": "Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6788, "text": "But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6789, "text": "Well, four wins.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6790, "text": "The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6791, "text": "So, where's the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6792, "text": "Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6793, "text": "So, that's another feature.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6794, "text": "The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6795, "text": "It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6796, "text": "So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6797, "text": "So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6798, "text": "So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6799, "text": "And so, we have to try both.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6800, "text": "OK, but so we'll get back to that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6801, "text": "For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6802, "text": "So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6803, "text": "And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6804, "text": "If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6805, "text": "And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6806, "text": "And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6807, "text": "So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6808, "text": "But, it will again involve the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6809, "text": "OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6810, "text": "OK, so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function that's actually just quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6811, "text": "So, let's say I have a function, <EXPRESSION> that's of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 6812, "text": "OK, so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well, and if you plug <EQUATION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 85}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 114}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 138, "end_offset": 148}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 161, "end_offset": 173}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 212}]}
{"id": 6813, "text": "You can also see, if you try to do a linear approximation of this, well, all these guys are much smaller than <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are small.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 122}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 127, "end_offset": 139}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 145, "end_offset": 157}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 162, "end_offset": 174}]}
{"id": 6814, "text": "So, the linear approximation, the tangent plane to the graph is really just <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"id": 6815, "text": "OK, so, how do we do it?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6816, "text": "Well, yesterday we actually did an example.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6817, "text": "It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it, so remember, we were looking at something that started with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 131}]}
{"id": 6818, "text": "And, there were other terms.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6819, "text": "But, let's forget them now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6820, "text": "And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"id": 6821, "text": "And now, this is a sum of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6822, "text": "So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6823, "text": "And so, the origin will be a minimum.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6826, "text": "OK, so let's do that.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6868, "text": "But, what does it look like?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6869, "text": "Well, it looks like, so we have some constant factors, and here we have a square, and here we have a square.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6870, "text": "So, basically, we've written this as a sum of two squares, well, a sum or a difference of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6871, "text": "And, maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6872, "text": "And you will have, the function will always take nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6873, "text": "So, the origin will be a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6874, "text": "Well, if you have a difference of two squares that typically you'll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger, you will have a positive or a negative quantity.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6882, "text": "So, it will be a negative quantity.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6887, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6888, "text": "So, if you want, what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates called <EQUATION>, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the difference of squares directly.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6889, "text": "OK, so that's the first case.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6890, "text": "The second case is where <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
