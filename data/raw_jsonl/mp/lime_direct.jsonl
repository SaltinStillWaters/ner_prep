{"id":5581,"text":"Which has to do with partial fractions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5582,"text":"I told you how to do partial fractions in several special cases and everybody was trying to figure out what the general picture was.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5583,"text":"But I'd like to lay that out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5584,"text":"I'll still only do it for an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5585,"text":"But it will be somehow a bigger example so that you can see what the general pattern is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5586,"text":"Partial fractions, remember, is a method for breaking up so-called rational functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5587,"text":"Which are ratios of polynomials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5588,"text":"And it shows you that you can always integrate them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5589,"text":"That's really the theme here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5590,"text":"And this is what's reassuring is that it always works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5591,"text":"That's really the bottom line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5592,"text":"And that's good because there are a lot of integrals that don't have formulas and these do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5593,"text":"It always works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5594,"text":"But, maybe with lots of help.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5595,"text":"So maybe slowly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5596,"text":"Now, there's a little bit of bad news, and I have to be totally honest and tell you what all the bad news is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5597,"text":"Along with the good news.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5598,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> step, which maybe I should be calling Step <EXPRESSION>, I had a Step <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> last time, is long division.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[{"id":1,"comment":"<Exp> are not to be labeled as expression"}]}
{"id":5600,"text":"And you do that by long division.","entities":[{"id":3218,"label":"method","start_offset":19,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5601,"text":"And the quotient is easy to take the antiderivative of up because it's just a polynomial.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5603,"text":"So that you can do the next step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5604,"text":"Now, the next step which I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time, that's great imagination, it's right after Step <EXPRESSION>, Step <EXPRESSION> was to factor the denominator.","entities":[{"id":3223,"label":"command","start_offset":150,"end_offset":156},{"id":3224,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":161,"end_offset":172}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5605,"text":"And I'm going to illustrate by example what the setup is here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5606,"text":"I don't know maybe, we'll do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5607,"text":"Some polynomial here, maybe cube this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3225,"label":"expression","start_offset":38,"end_offset":50},{"id":3226,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5608,"text":"So here I've factored the denominator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5609,"text":"That's what I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5610,"text":"Now, here's the <EXPRESSION> piece of bad news.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5611,"text":"In reality, if somebody gave you a multiplied out degree, whatever polynomial here, you would be very hard pressed to factor it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5612,"text":"A lot of them are extremely difficult to factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5613,"text":"And so that's something you would have to give to a machine to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5614,"text":"And it's just basically a hard problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5615,"text":"So obviously, we're only going to give you ones that you can do by hand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5616,"text":"So very low degree examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5617,"text":"And that's just the way it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5618,"text":"So this is really a hard step in disguise, in real life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5619,"text":"Anyway, we're just going to take it as given.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5621,"text":"So let's count up what its degree has to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5622,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3229,"label":"expression","start_offset":8,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5623,"text":"So this is degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3230,"label":"expression","start_offset":18,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5625,"text":"So all together it's this, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3235,"label":"expression","start_offset":36,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5626,"text":"And so this thing is of degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3236,"label":"expression","start_offset":31,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5627,"text":"All the way up to degree <EXPRESSION>, that's the possibilities for the numerator here.","entities":[{"id":3237,"label":"expression","start_offset":25,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5628,"text":"Now, the extra information that I want to impart right now, is just this setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5629,"text":"Which I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5630,"text":"And the setup is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5631,"text":"Now, it's going to take us a while to do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5632,"text":"We have this factor here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5633,"text":"We have another factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5634,"text":"We have another term, with the square.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5635,"text":"We have another term with the cube.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5636,"text":"We have another term with the <EXPRESSION> power.","entities":[{"id":3239,"label":"expression","start_offset":30,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5637,"text":"So this is what's going to happen whenever you have linear factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5638,"text":"You'll have a collection of terms like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5639,"text":"So you have <EXPRESSION> constants to take care of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5640,"text":"Now, with a quadratic in the denominator, you need a linear function in the numerator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5641,"text":"So that's, if you like, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> this quadratic term here.","entities":[{"id":3240,"label":"expression","start_offset":24,"end_offset":36},{"id":3241,"label":"expression","start_offset":37,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5642,"text":"And what I didn't show you last time was how you deal with higher powers of quadratic terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5644,"text":"Just the way you did in this case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5645,"text":"But then you're going to have to do the same thing with the next power.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5646,"text":"Now notice, just as in the case of this top row, I have just a constant here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5647,"text":"And even though I increased the degree of the denominator I'm not increasing the numerator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5648,"text":"It's staying just a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5649,"text":"It's not linear up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5650,"text":"It's better than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5651,"text":"It's just a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5652,"text":"And here it stayed a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5653,"text":"And here I stayed a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5654,"text":"Similarly here, even though I'm increasing the degree of the denominator, I'm leaving the numerator, the form of the numerator, alone.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5655,"text":"It's just a linear factor and a linear factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5656,"text":"So that's the key to this pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5657,"text":"I don't have quite as jazzy a song on mine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5658,"text":"So this is so long that it runs off the blackboard here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5659,"text":"So let's continue it on the next.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5660,"text":"We've got this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3243,"label":"expression","start_offset":15,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5661,"text":"I guess I have room for it over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5662,"text":"I'm going to talk about this in just a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5663,"text":"Alright, so here's the pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5664,"text":"Now, let me just do a count of the number of unknowns we have here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5666,"text":"That <EXPRESSION> is no coincidence.","entities":[{"id":3257,"label":"expression","start_offset":5,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5667,"text":"That's the degree of the polynomial.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5668,"text":"And it's the number of unknowns that we have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5669,"text":"And it's the number of degrees of freedom in a polynomial of degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5672,"text":"And so this is a very complicated system of equations for unknowns.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5676,"text":"So that's the other bad news.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5679,"text":"But that's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5681,"text":"You'll be able to evaluate this in no time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5682,"text":"But that's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5683,"text":"That's the only simplification of your previous method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5684,"text":"We don't have a method for this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5685,"text":"So I'm just showing what the whole method looks like but really you'd have to have a machine to implement this once it gets to be any size at all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5686,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5687,"text":"So there's an equation, there's this function <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":3272,"label":"equation","start_offset":46,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5690,"text":"and these things are known.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5692,"text":"And then when you cross-multiply on the other side, what you have is, well, it's <EXPRESSION>, if you cancel this denominator with that, you're going to get <EXPRESSION> the term for <EXPRESSION>, etc.","entities":[{"id":3278,"label":"expression","start_offset":81,"end_offset":93},{"id":3279,"label":"expression","start_offset":157,"end_offset":169},{"id":3280,"label":"expression","start_offset":183,"end_offset":195},{"id":3281,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":32},{"id":3282,"label":"command","start_offset":102,"end_offset":108},{"id":3283,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":114,"end_offset":125},{"id":3284,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":40,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5693,"text":"It's a monster equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5700,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5701,"text":"Well, that's a good question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5702,"text":"So you notice I didn't write it down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5703,"text":"Why didn't I write it down?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5704,"text":"Because it's incredibly long.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5705,"text":"In fact, you probably, so how many pages of writing would this take?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5706,"text":"This is about a page of writing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5707,"text":"So just think of your machine, how much time you want to spend on this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5708,"text":"So the answer is that you have to be realistic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5709,"text":"You're a human being, not a machine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5710,"text":"And so there's certain things that you can write down and other things you should attempt to write down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5711,"text":"So do not do this at home.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5713,"text":"It gets more and more complicated as time goes on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5715,"text":"So the pieces still need to be integrated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5716,"text":"We simplified this problem, but we didn't get rid of it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5717,"text":"We still have the problem of integrating the pieces.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5718,"text":"Now, some of the pieces are very easy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5719,"text":"This top row here, the antiderivatives of these, you can just write down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5720,"text":"By advanced guessing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5729,"text":"So this is why I'm mentioning this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5730,"text":"Because this kind of ingredient is something you already covered.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5731,"text":"And what is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5732,"text":"Well, you do this <EXPRESSION> by advanced guessing, although you it as the method of substitution.","entities":[{"id":3301,"label":"expression","start_offset":18,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5733,"text":"You realize that it's going to be of the form <EXPRESSION>, roughly speaking.","entities":[{"id":3302,"label":"expression","start_offset":46,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5734,"text":"And now we're going to fix that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5735,"text":"Because if you differentiate it you get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION> this.","entities":[{"id":3303,"label":"expression","start_offset":40,"end_offset":52},{"id":3304,"label":"expression","start_offset":61,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5741,"text":"This is the other piece.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5778,"text":"So it always works, but maybe slowly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5779,"text":"By the way, there's even another horrible thing that happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5780,"text":"Which is, if you handle this guy here, what's the technique.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5781,"text":"This is another technique that you learned, supposedly within the last few days.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5782,"text":"Completing the square.","entities":[{"id":3336,"label":"method","start_offset":0,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5783,"text":"So this, it turns out, you have to rewrite it this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5784,"text":"And then the evaluation is going to be expressed in terms of, I'm going to jump to the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5785,"text":"It's going to turn out to be expressed in terms of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5786,"text":"That's what will eventually show up in the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5788,"text":"So all of these things will be involved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5789,"text":"So now, the last message that I have for you is just this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5790,"text":"This thing is very complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5791,"text":"We're certainly never going to ask you to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5792,"text":"But you should just be aware that this level of complexity, we are absolutely stuck with in this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5793,"text":"And the reason why we're stuck with it is that this is what the formulas look like in the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5794,"text":"If the answers look like this, the formulas have to be this complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5796,"text":"If you differentiate this, you get some ratio of polynomials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5797,"text":"These are the things that come up when you take antiderivatives of those rational functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5798,"text":"So we're just stuck with these guys.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5799,"text":"And so don't let it get to you too much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5800,"text":"I mean, it's not so bad.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5801,"text":"In fact, there are computer programs that will do this for you anytime you want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5802,"text":"And you just have to be not intimidated by them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5803,"text":"They're like other functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5804,"text":"OK, that's it for the general comments on partial fractions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5805,"text":"Now we're going to change subjects to our last technique.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5807,"text":"And this technique is called integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":3338,"label":"method","start_offset":29,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5808,"text":"Please, just because its name sort of sounds like partial fractions, don't think it's the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5809,"text":"It's totally different.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5810,"text":"It's not the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5811,"text":"So this <EXPRESSION> is called integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":3340,"label":"method","start_offset":31,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5812,"text":"Now, unlike the previous case, where I couldn't actually justify to you that the linear algebra always works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5813,"text":"I claimed it worked, but I wasn't able to prove it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5814,"text":"That's a complicated theorem which I'm not able to do in this class.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5815,"text":"Here I can explain to you what's going on with integration by parts.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5816,"text":"It's just the fundamental theorem of calculus, if you like, coupled with the product formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5817,"text":"Sort of unwound and read in reverse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5818,"text":"And here's how that works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5819,"text":"If you take the product of <EXPRESSION> functions and you differentiate them, then we know that the product rule says that this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3341,"label":"expression","start_offset":27,"end_offset":39},{"id":3342,"label":"expression","start_offset":131,"end_offset":143}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5822,"text":"That is, this term here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5823,"text":"So what is this term?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5824,"text":"It's this other term, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3345,"label":"expression","start_offset":22,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5825,"text":"Minus the other piece.","entities":[{"id":3346,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5826,"text":"So I just rewrote this equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5827,"text":"And now I'm going to integrate it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5828,"text":"So here's the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5829,"text":"The integral of the left-hand side = the integral of the right-hand side.","entities":[{"id":3347,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":20,"end_offset":34},{"id":3348,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":57,"end_offset":72},{"id":3349,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":12},{"id":3350,"label":"method","start_offset":41,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5830,"text":"Well when I integrate a derivative, of I get back the function itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5831,"text":"That's the fundamental theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5832,"text":"So this it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5833,"text":"Sorry, I missed the <EXPRESSION>, which is important.","entities":[{"id":3351,"label":"expression","start_offset":20,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5834,"text":"I apologize.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5835,"text":"Let's put that in there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5836,"text":"So this is the integration by parts formula.","entities":[{"id":3352,"label":"method","start_offset":15,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5837,"text":"I'm going to write it <EXPRESSION> more time with the limits stuck in.","entities":[{"id":3354,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5838,"text":"It's also written this way, when you have a definite integral.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5839,"text":"Just the same formula, written twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5840,"text":"Alright, now I'm going to show you how it works on a few examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5841,"text":"And I have to give you a flavor for how it works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5842,"text":"But it'll grow as we get more and more experience.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5844,"text":"Which is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":3357,"label":"expression","start_offset":25,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5845,"text":"Now, it looks like there's sort of nothing we can do with this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5846,"text":"And we don't know what the solution is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6886,"text":"And there are many different interpretations of what the integral is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6887,"text":"Now, so let's draw a picture here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6889,"text":"And I have some curve here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6890,"text":"And what I have in mind is to find this area here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6891,"text":"And, of course, in order to do that, I need more information than just where we start and where we end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6892,"text":"I also need the bottom and the top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6894,"text":"And we have a notation for this, which is the notation using calculus for this as opposed to some geometric notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6895,"text":"And that's the following expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6896,"text":"It's called an integral, but now it's going to have what are known as limits on it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6899,"text":"So this is what's known as a definite integral.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6900,"text":"And it's interpreted geometrically as the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6902,"text":"Now, in order to understand what to do with this guy, I'm going to just describe very abstractly what we do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6904,"text":"So, to compute this area, we're going to follow initially <EXPRESSION> steps.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6905,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, we're going to divide into rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6909,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing we're going to do is to add up the areas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6911,"text":"That we were missing some pieces or were choosing some extra bits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6914,"text":"Pictorially, again, that looks like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6918,"text":"And then I'm going to chop things up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6919,"text":"And I'll decide on some rectangle, maybe some staircase pattern here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6920,"text":"Like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6921,"text":"Now, I don't care so much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6922,"text":"In some cases the rectangles overshoot; in some cases they're underneath.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6923,"text":"So the new area that I'm adding up is off.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6924,"text":"It's not quite the same as the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6925,"text":"It's this region here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6926,"text":"But it includes these extra bits here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6927,"text":"And then it's missing this little guy here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6928,"text":"This little bit there is missing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6929,"text":"And, as I say, these little pieces up here, this a little bit up here is extra.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6930,"text":"So that's why we're not really dividing up the region into rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6931,"text":"We're just taking rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6933,"text":"And they're going to be negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6934,"text":"Already, you can see it's kind of a thin piece of area, so we're not missing by much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6935,"text":"And as these get thinner and thinner, the problem goes away and we get the answer on the nose in the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6948,"text":"That's my choice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6950,"text":"So I'm overshooting with each rectangle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6951,"text":"And now I have to write down formulas for what these areas are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6952,"text":"Now, there's <EXPRESSION> big advantage that rectangles have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7482,"text":"So we have to give a geometric proof.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7485,"text":"OK, so let's draw a picture of what it is that we're going to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7486,"text":"Here is the circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7490,"text":"And this is the unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7491,"text":"I won't write that down on here but that's the unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7495,"text":"This distance is sin theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7499,"text":"That little piece in there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7500,"text":"So maybe I'll use a different color for that to indicate it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7501,"text":"So that's orange and that's this little chunk there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7503,"text":"Now in order to persuade you now that the limit is what it's supposed to be, I'm going to extend the picture just a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7526,"text":"Well, it's because as the angle theta gets very small, this curved piece looks more and more like a straight <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4701,"label":"expression","start_offset":109,"end_offset":121}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7527,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7528,"text":"And if you get very, very close here the green segment and the orange segment would just merge.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7529,"text":"They would be practically on top of each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7532,"text":"I guess I'll articulate that by saying that short curves are nearly straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7533,"text":"Alright, so that's the principle that we're using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7534,"text":"Or short pieces of curves, if you like, are nearly straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7535,"text":"So if you like, this is the principle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7536,"text":"So short pieces of curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7537,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7538,"text":"So now I also need to give you a proof of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4702,"label":"expression","start_offset":42,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7544,"text":"Again I'm gonna make some kind of interpretation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7545,"text":"Now this time I'm going to draw the same sort of bow and arrow arrangement, but maybe I'll exaggerate it a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7546,"text":"So here's the vertex of the sector, but we'll maybe make it a little longer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7547,"text":"Alright, so here it is, and here was that middle line which was the unit Whoops.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7548,"text":"OK, I think I'm going to have to tilt it up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7550,"text":"Alright, well you know on your pencil and paper it will look better than it does on my blackboard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7551,"text":"OK, so here we are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7552,"text":"Here's this shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7553,"text":"Now this angle is supposed to be theta and this angle is another theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7555,"text":"That's the same as in the other picture, except we've exaggerated a bit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7556,"text":"And now we have this vertical line, which again I'm gonna draw in green, the bow string.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7557,"text":"But notice that as the vertex gets farther and farther away, the curved line gets closer and closer to being a vertical line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7558,"text":"That's sort of the flip side, by expansion, of the zoom in principle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7559,"text":"The principle that curves are nearly straight when you zoom in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7560,"text":"If you zoom out that would mean sending this vertex way, way out somewhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7561,"text":"The curved line, the piece of the circle, gets more and more straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7562,"text":"And now let me show you where this numerator <EXPRESSION> is on this picture.","entities":[{"id":4708,"label":"expression","start_offset":45,"end_offset":57}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7563,"text":"So where is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7564,"text":"Well, this whole distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4709,"label":"expression","start_offset":29,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7565,"text":"But the distance from the vertex to the green is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4710,"label":"expression","start_offset":49,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7567,"text":"So this little tiny, bitty segment here is basically the gap between the curve and the vertical segment.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7568,"text":"So the gap = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4711,"label":"expression","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7569,"text":"So now you can see that as this point gets farther away, if this got sent off to the Stata Center, you would hardly be able to tell the difference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7570,"text":"The bow string would coincide with the bow and this little gap between the bow string and the bow would be tending to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4712,"label":"expression","start_offset":118,"end_offset":130}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7572,"text":"The scaled version of that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7573,"text":"Yeah, question down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7574,"text":"And the answer is yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7575,"text":"In my strange analogy with zooming in, what I did was I zoomed out the picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7576,"text":"So in other words, if you imagine you're taking this and you're putting it under a microscope over here and you're looking at something where theta is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7577,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7578,"text":"But now because I want my picture, I expanded my picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7579,"text":"So the ratio is the thing that's preserved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7580,"text":"So if I make it so that this gap is tiny.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7581,"text":".","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7583,"text":"Let me say this <EXPRESSION> more time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7584,"text":"I'm afraid I've made life complicated for myself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7586,"text":"But I want to keep on blowing up the picture so that I can see the difference between the vertical and the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7587,"text":"So that's very much like if you are on a video screen and you zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, and zoom in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7588,"text":"So the question is what would that look like?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7589,"text":"That has the same effect as sending this point out farther and farther in that direction, to the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7590,"text":"And so I'm just trying to visualize it for you by leaving the <EXPRESSION> at this scale, but actually the scale of the picture is then changing when I do that.","entities":[{"id":4719,"label":"expression","start_offset":62,"end_offset":74}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7591,"text":"So theta is going to <EXPRESSION>, but I I'm rescaling so that it's of a size that we can look at it, And then imagine what's happening to it.","entities":[{"id":4720,"label":"expression","start_offset":21,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7592,"text":"OK, does that answer your question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7595,"text":"It's the ratio of this little short thing to this longer thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7596,"text":"And this is getting much, much shorter than this total length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7597,"text":"You're absolutely right that we're comparing <EXPRESSION> quantities which are going to <EXPRESSION>, but <EXPRESSION> of them is much smaller than the other.","entities":[{"id":4723,"label":"expression","start_offset":45,"end_offset":57},{"id":4724,"label":"expression","start_offset":88,"end_offset":100},{"id":4725,"label":"expression","start_offset":106,"end_offset":118}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7601,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7602,"text":"Here, I wrote minus that, that is I replaced <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4731,"label":"expression","start_offset":45,"end_offset":57},{"id":4732,"label":"expression","start_offset":61,"end_offset":73},{"id":4733,"label":"command","start_offset":36,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7603,"text":"But then I wrote this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7604,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is the negative of this.","entities":[{"id":4734,"label":"expression","start_offset":3,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7605,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7606,"text":"And if I show that this goes to <EXPRESSION>, it's the same as showing the other <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4735,"label":"expression","start_offset":32,"end_offset":44},{"id":4736,"label":"expression","start_offset":81,"end_offset":93},{"id":4737,"label":"expression","start_offset":102,"end_offset":114}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7607,"text":"Another question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7611,"text":"Ah, OK so this is a very important point, and in fact it's the very next point that I wanted to make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7612,"text":"Namely, notice that in this calculation it was very important that we used length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7613,"text":"And that means that the way that we're measuring theta, is in what are known as radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7616,"text":"If we measure them in degrees, for example, it would be completely wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7618,"text":"The correct measure is the length along the unit circle, which is what radians are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7619,"text":"And so this is only true if we use radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7620,"text":"So again, a little warning here, that this is in radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7621,"text":"Now here <EXPRESSION> is in radians.","entities":[{"id":4742,"label":"expression","start_offset":9,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7622,"text":"The formulas are just wrong if you use other units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7623,"text":"Ah yeah?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7624,"text":"And the reason is that the relationship between this picture up here and this picture down here, is that I'm drawing a different shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7625,"text":"Namely, what I'm really imagining here is a much, much smaller theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7626,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7627,"text":"And then I'm blowing that up in scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7628,"text":"So this scale of this picture down here is very different from the scale of the picture up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7629,"text":"And if the angle is very, very, very small then <EXPRESSION> has to be very, very long in order for me to finish the circle.","entities":[{"id":4743,"label":"expression","start_offset":48,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7630,"text":"So, in other words, this length is <EXPRESSION> because that's what I'm insisting on.","entities":[{"id":4744,"label":"expression","start_offset":35,"end_offset":47}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7631,"text":"So, I'm claiming that that's how I define this circle, to be of unit radius.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7632,"text":"Another question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7633,"text":"So let me, let me take you through a couple of steps, because I think probably other people are also having trouble with this visualization.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7634,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization I'm gonna try to demonstrate on this picture up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7635,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization is that I should think of a beak of a bird closing down, getting narrower and narrower.","entities":[{"id":4746,"label":"expression","start_offset":4,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7636,"text":"So in other words, the angle theta has to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7637,"text":"OK, that's the <EXPRESSION> step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7638,"text":"So that's the process that we're talking about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7639,"text":"Now, in order to draw that, once theta gets incredibly narrow, in order to depict that I have to blow the whole picture back up in order be able to see it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7640,"text":"Otherwise it just disappears on me.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7641,"text":"In fact in the limit <EQUATION>, it's meaningless.","entities":[{"id":4748,"label":"equation","start_offset":21,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7642,"text":"It's just a flat line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7643,"text":"That's the whole problem with these tricky limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7645,"text":"It's only just a little away that they're actually useful, that you get useful geometric information out of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7646,"text":"So we're just a little away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7648,"text":"It's supposed to be that theta is open a tiny crack, just a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7649,"text":"And the smallest I can draw it on the board for you to visualize it is using the whole length of the blackboard here for that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7650,"text":"So I've opened a little tiny bit and by the time we get to the other end of the blackboard, of course it's fairly wide.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7651,"text":"But this angle theta is a very small angle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7652,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7653,"text":"So I'm trying to imagine what happens as this collapses.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7654,"text":"Now, when I imagine that I have to imagine a geometric interpretation of both the numerator and the denominator of this quantity here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7655,"text":"And just see what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7656,"text":"Now I claimed the numerator is this little tiny bit over here and the denominator is actually half of this whole length here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7657,"text":"But the factor of <EXPRESSION> doesn't matter when you're seeing whether something tends to <EXPRESSION> or not.","entities":[{"id":4751,"label":"expression","start_offset":18,"end_offset":30},{"id":4752,"label":"expression","start_offset":92,"end_offset":104}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7658,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7659,"text":"And I claimed that if you stare at this, it's clear that this is much shorter than that vertical curve there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7660,"text":"And I'm claiming, so this is what you have to imagine, is this as it gets smaller and smaller and smaller still that has the same effect of this thing going way, way way, farther away and this vertical curve getting closer and closer and closer to the green.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7661,"text":"And so that the gap between them gets tiny and goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4753,"label":"expression","start_offset":55,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7662,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7663,"text":"So not only does it go to <EXPRESSION> that's not enough for us, but it also goes to <EXPRESSION> faster than this theta goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":4754,"label":"expression","start_offset":26,"end_offset":38},{"id":4755,"label":"expression","start_offset":85,"end_offset":97},{"id":4756,"label":"expression","start_offset":129,"end_offset":141}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7664,"text":"And I hope the evidence is pretty strong here because it's so tiny already at this stage.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7665,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7666,"text":"We are going to move forward and you'll have to ponder these things some other time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8278,"text":"So the main other thing that we talked about was the definition of a derivative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8279,"text":"And also there was sort of a goal which was to get to the meaning of the derivative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8280,"text":"So these are things - so we had a couple of ways of looking at it, or at least a couple that I'm going to emphasize right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8326,"text":"And these you can derive in reverse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8327,"text":"So I will describe that now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8328,"text":"So let me also emphasize the following thing: I want to read this backwards now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8329,"text":"This is the theme from the very beginning of this lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8330,"text":"Namely, if you're given the function <EXPRESSION>, you can figure out its derivative by this formula here.","entities":[{"id":5267,"label":"expression","start_offset":37,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8332,"text":"On the other hand, you can also use the formula in that direction, and if you know the slope of something, you can figure out what the limit is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8335,"text":"Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":5270,"label":"expression","start_offset":19,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8336,"text":"Suppose you look at this limit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8337,"text":"Well, I claim that you should recognize that is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the function <EQUATION>, which of course we know to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":5271,"label":"expression","start_offset":79,"end_offset":91},{"id":5272,"label":"equation","start_offset":108,"end_offset":118},{"id":5273,"label":"expression","start_offset":150,"end_offset":162}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8338,"text":"So this is reading this formula in reverse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8339,"text":"It's recognizing that <EXPRESSION> of these limits - let me rewrite this again here - <EXPRESSION> of these so-called difference quotient limits is a derivative.","entities":[{"id":5274,"label":"expression","start_offset":22,"end_offset":34},{"id":5275,"label":"expression","start_offset":86,"end_offset":98},{"id":5276,"label":"command","start_offset":60,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8340,"text":"And since we know a formula for that derivative, we can evaluate it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8341,"text":"And lastly, there's <EXPRESSION> other type of thing which I think you should know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8342,"text":"These are the ones you do with difference quotients.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8343,"text":"There are also other formulas that you want to be able to derive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8344,"text":"You want to be able to derive formulas by implicit differentiation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8345,"text":"In other words, the basic idea is to take whatever equation you've got and simplify it as much as possible, without insisting that you solve for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":5278,"label":"expression","start_offset":145,"end_offset":157}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8346,"text":"That's not necessarily the most appropriate way to get the rate of change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8347,"text":"The much simpler formula is <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":5279,"label":"equation","start_offset":28,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8348,"text":"And that <EXPRESSION> is easier to differentiate implicitly.","entities":[{"id":5280,"label":"expression","start_offset":9,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8349,"text":"So I should say, do this kind of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8350,"text":"So that's, if you like, a typical derivation that you might see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8351,"text":"And then there's <EXPRESSION> last type of problem that you'll face, and it's the other thing that I claim we discussed.","entities":[{"id":5281,"label":"expression","start_offset":17,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8352,"text":"And it goes all the way back to the <EXPRESSION> lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8353,"text":"So the last thing that we'll be talking about is tangent lines.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8354,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8355,"text":"The geometric point of view of a derivative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8356,"text":"And we'll be doing more of this in next the unit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8357,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> of all, you'll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8358,"text":"That's often fairly straightforward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8359,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing is to graph <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of a function.","entities":[{"id":5285,"label":"expression","start_offset":39,"end_offset":51},{"id":5286,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8360,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing, which I'm going to throw in here, because I regard it in a sort of geometric vein, although it's got an analytical aspect to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8361,"text":"So this is a picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8362,"text":"This is a computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8363,"text":"And if you combine the <EXPRESSION> together, you get something else.","entities":[{"id":5288,"label":"expression","start_offset":23,"end_offset":35},{"id":5289,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8364,"text":"And so this is to recognize differentiable functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8365,"text":"Alright, so how do you do this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8366,"text":"Well, we really only have <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.","entities":[{"id":5290,"label":"expression","start_offset":26,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8367,"text":"We're going to check the left and right tangents.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8368,"text":"They must be =.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8369,"text":"So again, this is a property that you should be familiar with from some of your exercises.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8370,"text":"And the idea is simply, that if the tangent line exists, it's the same from the right and from the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8371,"text":"Okay, now I'm going to just do <EXPRESSION> example here from this sort of qualitative sketching skill to give you an example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8372,"text":"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a graph of a function like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8373,"text":"And what I want to do underneath is draw the graph of the derivative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8375,"text":"So now, let's think about what it's supposed to look like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8376,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> step that you need to make in order to do this, is to draw a few tangent lines.","entities":[{"id":5295,"label":"expression","start_offset":8,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8377,"text":"I'm just going to draw <EXPRESSION> down here.","entities":[{"id":5296,"label":"expression","start_offset":23,"end_offset":35},{"id":5297,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8379,"text":"Now, the tangent lines here - notice that the slope of these tangent lines are all positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8380,"text":"So everything I draw down here is going to be above the <EXPRESSION>-axis.","entities":[{"id":5300,"label":"expression","start_offset":56,"end_offset":68}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8381,"text":"Furthermore, as I go further to the left, they get steeper and steeper.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8382,"text":"So they're getting higher and higher.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8383,"text":"So the function is coming down like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8384,"text":"It starts up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8385,"text":"Maybe I'll draw it in green to illustrate the graph here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8386,"text":"So that's this function here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8387,"text":"As we get farther out, it's getting flatter and flatter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8388,"text":"So it's leveling off, but above the axis like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8389,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> of the things to emphasize is, you should not expect the derivative to look like the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8390,"text":"It's totally different.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8391,"text":"It's keeping track at each point of its tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8392,"text":"On the other hand, you should get some kind of physical feel for it, and we'll be practicing this more in the next unit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8393,"text":"So let me give you an example of a function which does exactly this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":8400,"text":"Yes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8401,"text":"So that's in a lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":8402,"text":"I'm happy to do it right now, but it's going to take me a whole <EXPRESSION> minutes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9216,"text":"Just, in summary.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9247,"text":"So you really need this rule of thumb.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9603,"text":"So it's the same principle just repeated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9604,"text":"And now I just want to draw a picture of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9605,"text":"Here's a picture of it, I claim.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9607,"text":"And I did that on purpose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9608,"text":"But there is something that's increasing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9613,"text":"So it's increasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9614,"text":"It's getting less negative, and maybe eventually it'll curve up the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9615,"text":"And this is a picture of what I'm talking about here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9616,"text":"That's what it means to say that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.","entities":[{"id":6453,"label":"expression","start_offset":33,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9617,"text":"The slope is getting larger.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9618,"text":"And the way to describe a curve like this is that it's concave.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9619,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is concave up.","entities":[{"id":6454,"label":"expression","start_offset":3,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9620,"text":"And similarly, <EXPRESSION> negative is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION> concave, or implies <EXPRESSION> concave down.","entities":[{"id":6455,"label":"expression","start_offset":15,"end_offset":27},{"id":6456,"label":"expression","start_offset":70,"end_offset":82},{"id":6457,"label":"expression","start_offset":103,"end_offset":115}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9621,"text":"So those are the ways in which derivatives will help us qualitatively to draw graphs.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9624,"text":"In drawing pictures.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":9625,"text":"So I'm going to go through <EXPRESSION> example to introduce all the notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9627,"text":"So let's begin with a straightforward example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9629,"text":"Just, as I said, to be able to introduce all the notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9639,"text":"And similarly, in the other ranges, if <EXPRESSION> is very, very large, this becomes, if it crosses <EXPRESSION>, in fact, this becomes, this factor becomes negative and this <EXPRESSION> stays positive.","entities":[{"id":6467,"label":"expression","start_offset":39,"end_offset":51},{"id":6468,"label":"expression","start_offset":101,"end_offset":113},{"id":6469,"label":"expression","start_offset":176,"end_offset":188}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":9654,"text":"Maybe I'll even mark them in a, like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
