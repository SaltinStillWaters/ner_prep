{"id":2257,"text":"But it says use the data in the table to estimate the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 5:30 pm.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2260,"text":"So my best estimate, or our best estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 5:30 pm, which is between these two points, is the average slope between these two points.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2266,"text":"The trapezoidal sum for the fourth.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
