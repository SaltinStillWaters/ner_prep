{"id":4008,"text":"You get <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[8,20,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":4010,"text":"And you probably wondering, well, Sal, this is all nice and it looks fancy, but what good is this going to do me?

{"id":4017,"text":"Let me write it separately here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4018,"text":"And actually, try it the other way around, and you'll see that if you took the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, you would get something that's more complicated.","label":[[97,109,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4019,"text":"And then this is minus the integral of the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[57,69,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4020,"text":"So let's just remember what the product rule of differentiation was.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4021,"text":"And so how can we use this for integration by parts? Well, integration by parts tells us that if we have an integral where we have a function and then the derivative of another function, then we could use this formula to hopefully simplify it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4022,"text":"So you know, if the function if the derivative of a function is cosine, then we know the function itself is sine.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4023,"text":"It's easier for me to read, and I can derive at any time, just from the product rule.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4024,"text":"So if we were to integrate both sides well if you integrate this side, you're taking the integral of a derivative, you just get back to what you took the derivative originally of, so this just becomes <EXPRESSION>, and then we have to integrate the right hand side, well that just becomes and we're doing the indefinite integral, kind of the antiderivative, but we can use this tool when we do definite integrals as well.","label":[[201,213,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
