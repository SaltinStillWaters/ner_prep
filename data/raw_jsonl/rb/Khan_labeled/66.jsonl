{"id":4354,"text":"So where I left off, we said that we had this, I guess you could call it, equation or this function, although I didn't write it with the function notation, where I said, the distance = <EXPRESSION>, and I graphed it, it's like a parabola, right, for positive time.","label":[[185,197,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4355,"text":"So and the way you evaluate an indefinite integral, and let me show you that first, is that you figure out the integral.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4356,"text":"This tells us <EXPRESSION> things.","label":[[14,26,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4357,"text":"I mean, well, after <EXPRESSION> seconds, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].","label":[[20,32,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4358,"text":"What's a way that you could start to try to approximate how far you've traveled after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds? Well [? as I said, ?] you graph this, and you say, let's assume over some change in time, velocity is roughly constant, right? Let's say velocity is right here.","label":[[92,104,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4359,"text":"Right? So let's say we call this distance <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[42,54,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4360,"text":"I'm running out of time.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4361,"text":"And also, the area under this curve is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[39,51,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4362,"text":"So we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION>, right? That's evaluated at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract it, evaluate at <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[6,14,"command"],[23,35,"expression"],[40,52,"expression"],[81,93,"expression"],[107,115,"command"],[132,144,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4363,"text":"Let me clear it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4364,"text":"So as these <EXPRESSION>'s approach <EXPRESSION>, the number of rectangles actually approach infinity.","label":[[12,24,"expression"],[36,48,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4365,"text":"Actually, maybe I'll stick with this example, but I'll clear it a bit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4366,"text":"And it actually turns out that they're the same thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4367,"text":"So you could approximate how far you travel over that small change in time by multiplying that change in time, let's say that's like, you know, a millionth of a second, times the velocity at roughly that time, or maybe even the average velocity over that time, and you'd get the distance you've traveled over that very small fraction of time, right? But if you look at it visually, that also happens to be the area of this rectangle, right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4368,"text":"It's just, the velocity is always changing, you can't just take the slope, you actually have to take the derivative, right? So we took the derivative with respect to time of this function, or this equation, and we got <EXPRESSION>, and this is the velocity.","label":[[218,230,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4369,"text":"And so this is the definite integral.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4370,"text":"and I'm going to take the sum of each of the heights, the height at any given point, which is the velocity.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4371,"text":"And we could actually figure it out, too.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4372,"text":"Right? We start at <EXPRESSION> feet, and then we moved forward from there.","label":[[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4373,"text":"So I'm actually going to, I'll do that more rigorously later, but I think it's very important to get this intuitive feel of just what an integral is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4374,"text":"I think you know all this stuff now.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4375,"text":"But anyway, so going back to the problem.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4376,"text":"And let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, let's say we didn't know this at all, and let's say you didn't know that you could just take the antiderivative, because we just showed that, you know, the derivative of distance is velocity, so the antiderivative of velocity is distance.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4377,"text":"It isn't just this voodoo that happens to be there.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4378,"text":"The definite integral is literally, and they never do this in math texts, and that's what always kind of confused me, is that you can kind of view it like a sum, like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4379,"text":"And this is where I'm going to teach you the indefinite integral.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4380,"text":"And actually, that's how, if you ever write a computer program to approximate an integral, or approximate the area under a curve, that's the way a computer program would actually do it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4381,"text":"So after <EXPRESSION> seconds, we would have gone <EXPRESSION> feet.","label":[[9,21,"expression"],[50,62,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4382,"text":"And we evaluate this at <EXPRESSION>, and we evaluate it at <EXPRESSION>, and then we subtract the difference.","label":[[24,36,"expression"],[60,72,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4383,"text":"So let's say you couldn't just take the antiderivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4384,"text":"And actually, I just looked at the clock.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4385,"text":"Right? And the way you evaluate this, is you figure out the antiderivative, and you really don't have to do the <EXPRESSION> here, so the antiderivative, we know, is <EXPRESSION>, right? It's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[112,124,"expression"],[166,178,"expression"],[192,204,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4386,"text":"So the way you figure out the indefinite integral, is you say, and sometimes they won't write <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.","label":[[94,104,"equation"],[108,118,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4387,"text":"That's actually how I view it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4388,"text":"Erasing might be a good option with this one, since it's fairly messy.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4389,"text":"And what we said, is if you want to know how far you travel after <EXPRESSION> seconds, you just draw a bunch of these rectangles, and you sum up the area, right? And you could imagine, and you don't have to imagine, it's actually true, the smaller the bases of these rectangles, and the more of these rectangles you have, the more accurate your approximation will be, and you'll approach <EXPRESSION> things.","label":[[66,78,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4390,"text":"Right? So it's very interesting.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4391,"text":"So let me continue this in the next presentation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4392,"text":"They'll just say from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[22,34,"expression"],[38,50,"expression"],[54,66,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4393,"text":"Oh, that's ugly.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4394,"text":"The indefinite integral tells us <EXPRESSION> things.","label":[[33,45,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4395,"text":"And this is the s, or distance, axis.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4396,"text":"So let's use this to do a couple more examples.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4397,"text":"I just need space.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4398,"text":"And then we graphed it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4399,"text":"It could have been a variable.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4400,"text":"But the actual indefinite integral says, well, this is a sum, but it's the limit as the bases of these rectangles get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and we have more and more and more of these rectangles.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4401,"text":"So the integral from this is now a definite integral, extending from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.","label":[[69,79,"equation"],[83,93,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4402,"text":"So let's say that the distance, yeah, well, let's just say it looks something like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4403,"text":"So the indefinite integral, I don't know how comfortable you are with summation, I remember the first time I learned calculus, I wasn't that comfortable with summation, but it's really, all the indefinite integral, is is you can kind of view it as a sum, right? So now, you'll maybe understand a little bit more why this symbol looks kind of like a sigma.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4404,"text":"This tells us the area of the curve from <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>, right, it tells us this whole area, and it also tells us how far the object has gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.","label":[[41,51,"equation"],[55,65,"equation"],[158,170,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4405,"text":"Maybe, OK, so we have that indefinite integral.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4406,"text":"And then, what's the formula for the velocity? It's <EXPRESSION> and then I'm at times the base at each of these rectangles, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[52,64,"expression"],[125,137,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4407,"text":"So this is something pretty interesting.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4408,"text":"Let's say you start at some distance, and then it goes off like that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4409,"text":"I want to know how far is this thing gone after <EXPRESSION> seconds.","label":[[48,60,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4410,"text":"And this axis is of course time, this axis, maybe I shouldn't do <EXPRESSION>, because it looks so much like <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[65,77,"expression"],[109,121,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4411,"text":"So let me just say, let me continue with the problem, actually.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4412,"text":"Well, let's just call this, you know, I don't know, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[52,64,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4413,"text":"I'll now do it more general, actually.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4414,"text":"I was like, well, we want to figure out, if we were given this, if we were given just this, and I asked you, what is the distance that this object travels after time, you know, after <EXPRESSION> seconds? Let's, you know, let's say this <EQUATION> seconds.","label":[[183,195,"expression"],[237,247,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4415,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[3,15,"expression"],[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4416,"text":"All of a sudden, we see that the antiderivative is pretty darn similar to the area under the curve.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4417,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> feet.","label":[[7,19,"expression"],[21,33,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4418,"text":"And then we said, well, the velocity, if we know the distance, the velocity is just the change of the distance with respect to time.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4419,"text":"As you can tell, I don't plan much for these presentations.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4420,"text":"So that's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[10,22,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4421,"text":"So let me give you another example.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4422,"text":"Actually, maybe I should erase.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4423,"text":"Actually, I'm going to do that right now.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4424,"text":"You'll approach the area under this curve, right, almost the exact area under this curve, and you'd also get almost the exact value of the distance after, say, <EXPRESSION> seconds in this case, right? But <EXPRESSION> didn't have to be an exact number.","label":[[160,172,"expression"],[206,218,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4425,"text":"It's kind of the sum of each of these rectangles, but it's the limit, as if these were discrete rectangles, you could just do a sum, and you could make the rectangle bases smaller and smaller, and have more and more rectangles, and just do a regular sum.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4426,"text":"It tells us area, and it also tells us the antiderivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4427,"text":"Let me draw this twice, once for the distance, and once for its derivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4428,"text":"From <EQUATION> to <EQUATION>.","label":[[5,15,"equation"],[19,29,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4429,"text":"Right? We're already familiar with it as an antiderivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4430,"text":"And actually, I want to show you why we do this subtraction.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4431,"text":"And please look it up so you can see properly drawn integrals.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":4432,"text":"But in this case, the indefinite integral is just saying, well, I'm going to take the sum from <EQUATION>, right, so from <EQUATION>, to let's say in this example, <EQUATION>, right, because I said <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[95,105,"equation"],[122,132,"equation"],[164,174,"equation"],[198,210,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
