{"id":10166,"text":"At negative two two same exact idea, it would look like that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":10167,"text":"And so when you keep drawing these line segments over these kind of sample points in the cartesian or in the x-y plane, you start to get a sense of well what would a solution have to do.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":10169,"text":"This would be a solution, so maybe it would have to do something like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":10170,"text":"Or if we're looking only at functions and not relations I'll make it so it's very clear.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":10171,"text":"So maybe it would have to do something like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":10172,"text":"Or if the function started here based on what we've seen so far maybe it would have to do something like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":10174,"text":"And once again I'm doing this based on what the slope field is telling me.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":10176,"text":"Once again this is called a slope field.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
