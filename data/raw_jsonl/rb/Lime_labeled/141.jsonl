{"id":11594,"text":"So what does that mean?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11595,"text":"Is that we are thinking about the Hamiltonian for a system of <EXPRESSION> particles.","label":[[62,74,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11596,"text":"If they are not interacting, it can be written as the sum of the contributions for the individual particles.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11597,"text":"And if they are identical, it's basically the same particle for each one of them.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11598,"text":"Same Hamiltonian for each one of them.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11599,"text":"OK?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11600,"text":"How do we handle these?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11601,"text":"Well, if you regard this as a quantum problem, for a single particle-- so for each one of these Hamiltonians-- we can find the eigenstates.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11602,"text":"So there's a bunch of states that say label by <EXPRESSION> because we are ultimately have in mind the plane waves that describe gas particles in a box.","label":[[47,59,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11603,"text":"And there is corresponding energy levels for the single particles, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[67,79,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11604,"text":"And the single particle spectrum can therefore can be described by a bunch of energies, a lot of energy levels, with different values of <EXPRESSION> and different allowed discretized energies.","label":[[137,149,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11605,"text":"Now, when we want to describe a case of <EXPRESSION> particles that are non-interacting, we said that we could, in principle, pick one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here, one <EXPRESSION> here.","label":[[40,52,"expression"],[135,147,"expression"],[158,170,"expression"],[181,193,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11606,"text":"And if we are dealing with bosons, potentially more than one at each side.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11607,"text":"And so the state would then be described by a bunch of occupation numbers <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[74,86,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11608,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> if you are talking about fermions, but any integer if you are talking about bosons.","label":[[9,21,"expression"],[30,42,"expression"],[46,58,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11609,"text":"So this <EXPRESSION> being plus or minus was used to distinguish appropriate symmetrization or anti-symmetrization.","label":[[8,20,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11610,"text":"Now, once we have a state such as this, clearly the <EXPRESSION> particle hamintonium acting on a state that is symmetrized with these bunch of occupation numbers will give us back this state.","label":[[52,64,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":11612,"text":"Again, multiplying this state back.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11613,"text":"Of course, we have a constraint that the number of particles matches the sum of the occupation numbers.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11614,"text":"So then we said, OK, this is just a description of the state that they want to describe, or the set of states that represent this system of identical non-interacting partners in quantum mechanics.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11615,"text":"So the next stage, we want to do some kind of first statistics for them.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11616,"text":"And we had seen that basically, in order to assign appropriate statistics in case of quantum systems, we have to deal with a density matrix.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11617,"text":"And we saw that in the canonical representation, the density matrix is complicated and amounts to some kind of interaction among particles.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11618,"text":"Although there is no interaction at this level, the symmetrization or anti-symmetrization create states that are intermixed in a manner that appears as if you have an interaction.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11619,"text":"We found that, however, we could get rid of that by going to the grand canonical ensemble where we would trade in the constraint that the number of particles is fixed with a chemical potential.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11620,"text":"And in this ensemble, we found that the density matrix is diagonal in this representation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11621,"text":"So the diagonal elements can be thought of as the probability of one of these occupation number sets.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11622,"text":"And so the probability of a particular set of occupations in this grand canonical prescription is proportional to e to the beta-- of course we have mu if we are going to this grand canonical ensemble-- <EXPRESSION>, and then we had <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[202,214,"expression"],[232,244,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11623,"text":"So the probability that a particular one of these is occupied <EXPRESSION> times in this grand canonical prescription is simply an exponential.","label":[[62,74,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11624,"text":"And of course, the different <EXPRESSION> levels are completely independent of each other.","label":[[29,41,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11625,"text":"So the probability factor arises in this fashion.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11626,"text":"Of course, as any probability, we have to normalize this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11627,"text":"Normalization is appropriate.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11628,"text":"We call the grand canonical partition function and will be different whether we are dealing with boson statistics or fermion statistics.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11629,"text":"Actually, because we have a structure such as this, Q is going to be the product of the normalization of each individual one.","label":[[52,53,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11630,"text":"And therefore, <EXPRESSION> is going to be a sum of the contributions that I would get for the normalization of each individual ones.","label":[[15,27,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11631,"text":"And of course, the log of whatever normalization I have for the individual one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11632,"text":"If I have the case of a fermions where <EXPRESSION> gets <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> as the two possibilities, then the normalization will be simply <EXPRESSION> plus this exponential.","label":[[39,51,"expression"],[57,69,"expression"],[73,85,"expression"],[150,162,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11633,"text":"And I choose to write that as <EXPRESSION> where I have introduced <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,21,"command"],[30,42,"expression"],[67,79,"expression"],[86,98,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11634,"text":"Because this combination occurs all the time, I don't want to keep repeating that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11635,"text":"So this was for the case of fermions.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11636,"text":"For the case of bosons where <EXPRESSION> goes <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, et cetera, this is a geometric series.","label":[[29,41,"expression"],[47,59,"expression"],[61,73,"expression"],[75,87,"expression"],[89,101,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11637,"text":"For the geometric series, when I sum it, I would get <EXPRESSION> over this factor.","label":[[53,65,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11638,"text":"So when I take the log I will have a minus sign here.","label":[[10,14,"command"],[19,22,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11639,"text":"And I can put the Boson and Fermi cases together by simply putting a factor of <EXPRESSION> here so that I have the plus for the case of fermions and the minus for the case of bosons.","label":[[79,91,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11640,"text":"OK?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11641,"text":"So this is one thing that we will be using.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11642,"text":"The other thing is that this is the probability for this level having a certain occupation number.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11643,"text":"In k we can always ask, what is the average of <EXPRESSION>?","label":[[36,43,"command"],[47,59,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11644,"text":"And from this probability it is easy to calculate the average.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11645,"text":"And the answer, again, can be collapsed into one expression for the case of bosons and fermions as <EXPRESSION> encompassing both fermions and bosons.","label":[[99,111,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11646,"text":"So these results give some idea both at the microscopic level-- in terms of occupation numbers of these different levels-- and macroscopic level a grand partition function from which we can construct thermodynamics.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11647,"text":"Actually, full probability, again, in this ensemble which we can transform in principle and get density matrices, et cetera, in other basis.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11648,"text":"But these are the kinds of things that we can do for any interacting Hamiltonian.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11649,"text":"OK?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11650,"text":"Now, what I said over here was that I'm actually interested in the case of a gas.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11651,"text":"So let's again think about the type of gas such as the one in this room that we are interested.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11652,"text":"And again, to make a contrast with something that we may want to do later, let's emphasize that it is a non-relativistic gas.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11653,"text":"So the Hamiltonian <EXPRESSION> is essentially free particle in a box of volume <EXPRESSION>, the thing that we have been using all the time, just the kinetic energy of a one particle state.","label":[[19,31,"expression"],[80,92,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11654,"text":"And for that we know that the single particle energy levels are characterized by a vector <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[90,102,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11655,"text":"As three components, in fact.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11656,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[4,16,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11657,"text":"And we've discussed what the discretization of <EXPRESSION> is appropriate to the size of the box.","label":[[47,59,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11658,"text":"We won't go over that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11659,"text":"So again, maybe it is important to mention that because of the discretizatoin of the <EXPRESSION> values, the spacing between possible values of <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION> in each direction.","label":[[85,97,"expression"],[145,157,"expression"],[162,174,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11660,"text":"And ultimately what we want to do is to replace these sums over <EXPRESSION> in the limit of large boxes with integrals over <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[40,47,"command"],[54,58,"command_attribute"],[64,76,"expression"],[125,136,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11661,"text":"So these go over to an integral over <EXPRESSION> times the density factor that you get in going from the sum to the integral, which is <EXPRESSION> times the volume.","label":[[37,49,"expression"],[136,148,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11662,"text":"I will introduce one other factor here, which is that when we are talking about quantum particles and bosons and fermions, they are typically assigned also another state-- another parameter-- that characterizes their spin.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11663,"text":"And depending on the possible values of spin, you will have <EXPRESSION> copies of the system.","label":[[60,72,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11664,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> will be related to the quantum spin-- to the formula <EXPRESSION>-- so that when you have fermions, typically <EXPRESSION> is half integer and this will be an even number.","label":[[8,21,"expression"],[75,87,"expression"],[132,144,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11665,"text":"Whereas for bosons it will be an odd number.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11666,"text":"So that's, again, something that we've seen.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11667,"text":"You just, essentially says multiply everything by some factor of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[65,77,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11668,"text":"Now if I go through this procedure that I have outlined here, I will ultimately get the grand partition function of the gas-- which as we will see is related to its pressure-- in terms of the chemical potential.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11669,"text":"Throughout the course we've seen that the more interesting thing to look at is how things depend on density rather than chemical potential.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11670,"text":"So I'd better use this result to get what the density is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11671,"text":"How do I do that?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":11672,"text":"Well, once I have determined what the chemical potential is, the average number of particles will be the sum over and the average occupation numbers that I have in all of these states.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
