{"id":12563,"text":"We're talking today about exponentials and logarithms.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12564,"text":"And these are the last functions that I need to introduce, the last standard functions that we need to connect with calculus, that you've learned about.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12565,"text":"And they're certainly as fundamental, if not more so, than trigonometric functions.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12566,"text":"So first of all, we'll start out with a number, <EXPRESSION>, which is positive, which is usually called a base.","label":[[48,60,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12567,"text":"And then we have these properties that <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[39,51,"expression"],[62,74,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12568,"text":"That's how we get started.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12569,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[4,16,"expression"],[20,32,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12570,"text":"And of course <EXPRESSION>, not surprisingly, is <EXPRESSION>, etc.","label":[[14,26,"expression"],[49,61,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12571,"text":"And the general rule is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[29,41,"expression"],[45,57,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12572,"text":"So this is the basic rule of exponents, and with these two initial properties, that defines the exponential function.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12573,"text":"And then there's an additional property, which is deduced from these, which is the composition of exponential functions, which is that you take <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[139,143,"command"],[144,156,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12574,"text":"Then that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[26,38,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12575,"text":"So that's an additional property that we'll take for granted, which you learned in high school.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12576,"text":"Now, in order to understand what all the values of <EXPRESSION> are, we need to first remember that if you're taking a rational power that it's the ratio of <EXPRESSION> integers power of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[51,63,"expression"],[157,169,"expression"],[188,200,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12577,"text":"That's going to be <EXPRESSION>, and then we're going to have to take the nth root of that.","label":[[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12578,"text":"So that's the definition.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12579,"text":"And then, when you're defining <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is defined for all <EXPRESSION> by filling in.","label":[[31,43,"expression"],[48,60,"expression"],[80,92,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12580,"text":"So I'm gonna use that expression in quotation marks, \"filling in\" by continuity.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12581,"text":"This is really what your calculator does when it gives you <EXPRESSION>, because you can't even punch in <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[59,71,"expression"],[105,117,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12582,"text":"It doesn't really exist on your calculator.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12583,"text":"There's some decimal expansion.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12584,"text":"So it takes the decimal expansion to a certain length and spits out a number which is pretty close to the correct answer.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12585,"text":"But indeed, in theory, there is an <EXPRESSION>, even though the <EXPRESSION> is irrational.","label":[[35,47,"expression"],[65,77,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12586,"text":"And there's <EXPRESSION> and so forth.","label":[[12,24,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12587,"text":"All right, so that's the exponential function, and let's draw a picture of one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12588,"text":"So we'll try, say <EQUATION> here.","label":[[18,28,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12589,"text":"And I'm not going to draw such a careful graph, but let's just plot the most important point, which is the point (0, 1).","label":[[113,119,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12590,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[7,19,"expression"],[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12591,"text":"And then maybe we'll go back up here to <EXPRESSION> here.","label":[[40,52,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12592,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is this point here.","label":[[4,16,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12593,"text":"This is (-1, 1\/2), the reciprocal.","label":[[8,17,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12594,"text":"And over here, we have <EXPRESSION>, and so that goes all the way up to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[23,35,"expression"],[72,84,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12595,"text":"And then exponentials are remarkably fast.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12596,"text":"So it's off the board what happens next out at <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[47,59,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12597,"text":"It's already above my range here, but the graph looks something like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12598,"text":"All right.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12599,"text":"Now I've just visually, at least, graphically filled in all the rest of the points.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12600,"text":"You have to imagine all these rational numbers, and so forth.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12601,"text":"So this point here would have been (1, 2).","label":[[35,41,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12602,"text":"And so forth.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12603,"text":"All right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12604,"text":"So that's not too far along.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12605,"text":"So now what's our goal?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12606,"text":"Well, obviously we want to do calculus here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12607,"text":"So our goal, here, for now - and it's gonna take a while.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12608,"text":"We have to think about it pretty hard.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12609,"text":"We have to calculate what this derivative is.","label":[[11,20,"command"],[31,41,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12610,"text":"All right, so we'll get started.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12611,"text":"And the way we get started is simply by plugging in the definition of the derivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12612,"text":"The derivative is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[31,43,"expression"],[52,64,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12613,"text":"So that's what it is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12614,"text":"And now, the only step that we can really perform here to make this is into something a little bit simpler is to use this very first rule that we have here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12615,"text":"That the exponential of the sum is the product of the exponentials.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12616,"text":"So we have here, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[17,29,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12617,"text":"So what I want to use is just the property that <EQUATION>.","label":[[18,21,"command"],[48,58,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12618,"text":"And if I do that, I see that I can factor out a common factor in the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[35,41,"command"],[48,61,"command_attribute"],[89,100,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12619,"text":"So we'll write this as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> times this ratio, now <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[9,14,"command"],[36,48,"expression"],[57,69,"expression"],[70,75,"command"],[92,104,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12620,"text":"So far, so good?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12621,"text":"We're actually almost to some serious progress here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12622,"text":"So there's one other important conceptual step which we need to understand.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12623,"text":"And this is a relatively simple one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12624,"text":"We actually did this before, by the way.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12625,"text":"We did this with sines and cosines.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12626,"text":"The next thing I want to point out to you is that you're used to thinking of <EXPRESSION> as being the variable.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12627,"text":"And indeed, already we were discussing <EXPRESSION> as being the variable and <EXPRESSION> as being fixed.","label":[[39,51,"expression"],[78,90,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12628,"text":"But for the purposes of this limit, there's a different variable that's moving.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12629,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is fixed and <EXPRESSION> is the thing that's moving.","label":[[0,12,"expression"],[26,38,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12630,"text":"So that means that this factor here, which is a common factor, is constant.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12631,"text":"And we can just factor it out of the limit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12632,"text":"It doesn't affect the limit at all.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12633,"text":"A constant times a limit is the same as whether we multiply before or after we take the limit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12634,"text":"So I'm just going to factor that out.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12635,"text":"So that's my next step here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12636,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, and then I have the limit <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[0,12,"expression"],[40,52,"expression"],[61,73,"expression"],[77,89,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12637,"text":"All right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12638,"text":"And so what I have here, so this is by definition the derivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12639,"text":"So here is <EXPRESSION>, and it's = this expression here.","label":[[11,23,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12640,"text":"Now, I want to stare at this expression, and see what it's telling us, because it's telling us as much as we can get so far, without some-- So first let's just look at what this says.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12641,"text":"So what it's saying is that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times something that we don't yet know.","label":[[46,58,"expression"],[62,74,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12642,"text":"And I'm going to call this something, this mystery number, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[59,71,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12643,"text":"So I'm gonna make the label, <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of a to the <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[13,17,"command"],[29,41,"expression"],[57,69,"expression"],[78,90,"expression"],[103,115,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12644,"text":"All right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12645,"text":"So this is a definition.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12646,"text":"So this mystery number <EXPRESSION> has a geometric interpretation, as well.","label":[[23,35,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12647,"text":"So let me describe that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12648,"text":"It has a geometric interpretation, and it's a very, very significant number.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12649,"text":"So let's work out what that is.","label":[[9,17,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12650,"text":"So first of all, let's rewrite the expression in the box, using the shorthand for this number.","label":[[23,30,"command"],[35,45,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12651,"text":"So if I just rewrite it, it says <EXPRESSION> = this factor, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[13,20,"command"],[33,45,"expression"],[70,82,"expression"],[84,89,"command"],[90,102,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12652,"text":"So the derivative of the exponential is this mystery number times <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[60,65,"command"],[66,78,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12653,"text":"So we've almost solved the problem of finding the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[64,76,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12654,"text":"We just have to figure out this one number, <EXPRESSION>, and we get the rest.","label":[[44,56,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12655,"text":"So let me point out two more things about this number, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[55,67,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12656,"text":"So first of all, if I plug in <EQUATION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION> , at <EQUATION>.","label":[[22,29,"command"],[30,40,"equation"],[61,73,"expression"],[79,88,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12657,"text":"According to this formula, that's <EXPRESSION>, which of course <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[34,46,"expression"],[64,76,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12658,"text":"So what is <EXPRESSION>?","label":[[11,23,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12659,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of this function at <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[0,12,"expression"],[51,63,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12660,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is the slope of <EQUATION>, of the graph.","label":[[3,15,"expression"],[32,42,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12661,"text":"The graph of <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[13,25,"expression"],[29,41,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12662,"text":"So again over here, if you looked at the picture.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12663,"text":"I'll draw the one tangent line in here, which is this one here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12664,"text":"And this thing has slope, what we're calling <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[45,57,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12665,"text":"So, if I graph the function <EQUATION>, I'll get a certain slope here.","label":[[9,14,"command"],[15,27,"command_attribute"],[28,38,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12666,"text":"If I graph it with a different base, I might get another slope.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12667,"text":"And what we got so far is the following phenomenon: if we know this one number, if we know the slope at this one place, we will be able to figure out the formula for the slope everywhere else.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12668,"text":"Now, that's actually exactly the same thing that we did for sines and cosines.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12669,"text":"We knew the slope of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> function at <EQUATION>.","label":[[25,37,"expression"],[46,58,"expression"],[71,81,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12670,"text":"The sine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[28,40,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12671,"text":"The cosine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12672,"text":"And then from the sum formulas, well that's exactly this kind of thing here, from the sum formulas.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12673,"text":"This sum formula, in fact is easier than the ones for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[54,66,"expression"],[71,83,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12674,"text":"From the sum formulas, we worked out what the slope was everywhere.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12675,"text":"So we're following the same procedure that we did before.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12676,"text":"But at this point we're stuck.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12677,"text":"We're stuck, because that time using radians, this very clever idea of radians in geometry, we were able to actually figure out what the slope is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12678,"text":"Whereas here, we're not so sure, what <EXPRESSION> is, for instance.","label":[[38,50,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12679,"text":"We just don't know yet.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12680,"text":"So, the basic question that we have to deal with right now is what is <EXPRESSION>?","label":[[70,82,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12681,"text":"That's what we're left with.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12682,"text":"And, the curious fact is that the clever thing to do is to beg the question.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12683,"text":"So we're going to go through a very circular route here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12684,"text":"That is circuitous, not circular.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12685,"text":"Circular is a bad word in math.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12686,"text":"That means that one thing depends on another, and that depends on it, and maybe both are wrong.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12687,"text":"Circuitous means, we're going to be taking a roundabout route.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12688,"text":"And we're going to discover that even though we refuse to answer this question right now, we'll succeed in answering it eventually.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12689,"text":"All right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12690,"text":"So how are we going to beg the question?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12691,"text":"What we're going to say instead is we're going to define a mystery base, or number <EXPRESSION>, as the unique number, so that <EQUATION>.","label":[[50,56,"command"],[83,95,"expression"],[127,137,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12692,"text":"That's the trick that we're going to use.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12693,"text":"We don't yet know what <EXPRESSION> is, but we're just going to suppose that we have it.","label":[[23,35,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12694,"text":"Now, I'm going to show you a bunch of consequences of this, and also I have to persuade you that it actually does exist.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12695,"text":"So first, let me explain what the first consequence is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12696,"text":"First of all, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then if you look at this formula over here and you write it down for e, you have something which is a very usable formula.","label":[[17,29,"expression"],[33,45,"expression"],[116,117,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12697,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[0,12,"expression"],[21,33,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12698,"text":"All right, so that's an incredibly important formula which is the fundamental one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12699,"text":"It's the only one you have to remember from what we've done.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12700,"text":"So maybe I should have highlighted it in several colors here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12701,"text":"That's a big deal.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12702,"text":"Very happy.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12703,"text":"And again, let me just emphasize, also that this is the one which at <EQUATION> has slope <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[69,79,"equation"],[90,102,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12704,"text":"That's the way we defined it, alright?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12705,"text":"So if you plug in <EQUATION> here on the right hand side, you got <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[10,17,"command"],[18,28,"equation"],[66,78,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12706,"text":"Slope <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.","label":[[6,17,"expression"],[22,32,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12707,"text":"So that's great.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12708,"text":"Except of course, since we don't know what <EXPRESSION> is, this is a little bit dicey.","label":[[43,55,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":12712,"text":"In fact, we won't get to what <EXPRESSION> really is until the very end of this lecture.","label":[[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12713,"text":"But I have to persuade you why <EXPRESSION> exists.","label":[[31,43,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12714,"text":"We have to have some explanation for why we know there is such a number.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12715,"text":"Okay, so first of all, let me start with the one that we supposedly know, which is the function <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[96,108,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12716,"text":"We'll call it <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[6,10,"command"],[14,26,"expression"],[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12717,"text":"All right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12718,"text":"So that's the first thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12719,"text":"And remember, that the property that it had, was that <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[54,66,"expression"],[71,83,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":12732,"text":"So what happens when you stretch a function?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12733,"text":"That's the same thing as shrinking the x axis.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12734,"text":"So when <EXPRESSION> gets larger, this corresponding point over here would be over here, and so this corresponding point would be over here.","label":[[8,20,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":12935,"text":"But let's just rewrite that.","label":[[15,22,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12936,"text":"That's the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, which is <EQUATION>, right?","label":[[25,37,"expression"],[48,58,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12937,"text":"So this is our differentiation formula.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12938,"text":"So here we have <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,28,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12939,"text":"<EQUATION>, if I just multiply through by <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[0,10,"equation"],[42,54,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12940,"text":"And that's what we wanted.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12941,"text":"That's <EQUATION>.","label":[[7,17,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12942,"text":"So this is the way that logarithmic differentiation works.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12943,"text":"It's the same arithmetic as the previous method, but we don't have to convert to base <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[86,98,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12944,"text":"We're just keeping track of the exponents and doing differentiation on the exponents, and multiplying through at the end.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12945,"text":"Okay, so I'm going to do two trickier examples, which illustrate logarithmic differentiation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12946,"text":"Again, these could be done equally well by using base <EXPRESSION>, but I won't do it.","label":[[54,66,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12947,"text":"Method one and method two always both work.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12948,"text":"So here's a second example: again this is a problem when you have moving exponents.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12949,"text":"But this time, we're going to complicate matters by having both a moving exponent and a moving base.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12950,"text":"So we have a function <EXPRESSION>, which is, well maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>, since we already had a function <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[22,34,"expression"],[62,66,"command"],[70,82,"expression"],[117,129,"expression"],[139,151,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12951,"text":"A really complicated looking function here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12952,"text":"So again you can handle this by converting to base <EXPRESSION>, method one.","label":[[51,63,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12953,"text":"But we'll do the logarithmic differentiation version, alright?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12954,"text":"So I take the logs of both sides.","label":[[5,9,"command"],[14,32,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12955,"text":"And now I differentiate it.","label":[[10,23,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12956,"text":"And now when I differentiate this here, I have to use the product rule.","label":[[15,28,"command"],[50,53,"command"],[58,70,"method"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12957,"text":"This time, instead of having <EXPRESSION>, a constant, I have a variable here.","label":[[29,41,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12958,"text":"So I have two factors.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12959,"text":"I have <EXPRESSION> when I differentiate with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[7,19,"expression"],[27,40,"command"],[57,69,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12960,"text":"When I differentiate with respect to this factor here, I get that <EXPRESSION> times the derivative of that, which is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[7,20,"command"],[66,78,"expression"],[118,130,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12961,"text":"So, here's my formula.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12962,"text":"Almost finished.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12963,"text":"So I have here <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[15,27,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12964,"text":"I'm going to multiply these two things together.","label":[[13,21,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12965,"text":"I'll put it on the other side, because I don't want to get it mixed up with <EXPRESSION>, the quantity.","label":[[5,8,"command"],[76,88,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12966,"text":"And now I'm almost done.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12967,"text":"I have <EQUATION>, and that's just <EQUATION>.","label":[[7,17,"equation"],[35,45,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12968,"text":"That's it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12969,"text":"So these two methods always work for moving exponents.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12970,"text":"So the next thing that I'd like to do is another fairly tricky example.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12971,"text":"And this one is not strictly speaking within calculus.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12972,"text":"Although we're going to use the tools that we just described to carry it out, in fact it will use some calculus in the very end.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12973,"text":"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to evaluate the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[41,49,"command"],[50,59,"command_attribute"],[63,75,"expression"],[84,96,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12974,"text":"So now, the reason why I want to discuss this is, is it turns out to have a very interesting answer.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12975,"text":"And it's a problem that you can approach exactly by this method.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12976,"text":"And the reason is that it has a moving exponent.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12977,"text":"The exponent n here is changing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12978,"text":"And so if you want to keep track of that, a good way to do that is to use logarithms.","label":[[70,73,"expression"],[74,84,"method"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12979,"text":"So in order to figure out this limit, we're going to take the log of it and figure out what the limit of the log is, instead of the log of the limit.","label":[[53,57,"command"],[58,65,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12980,"text":"Those will be the same thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12981,"text":"So we're going to take the natural log of this quantity here, and that's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[18,22,"command"],[23,38,"command_attribute"],[73,85,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12982,"text":"And now I'm going to rewrite this in a form which will make it more recognizable, so what I'd like to do is I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>, or maybe I should say it this way: <EQUATION>.","label":[[21,28,"command"],[121,126,"command"],[127,139,"expression"],[176,186,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12983,"text":"So if <EXPRESSION> is going to infinity, then this <EXPRESSION> is going to be going to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[6,18,"expression"],[51,63,"expression"],[88,100,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12984,"text":"So this is more familiar territory for us in this class, anyway.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12985,"text":"So let's rewrite it.","label":[[9,16,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12986,"text":"So here, we have <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[17,29,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12987,"text":"And then that is multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[31,43,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12988,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is the reciprocal of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[3,15,"expression"],[37,49,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12989,"text":"Now I want to change this in a very, very minor way.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12990,"text":"I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.","label":[[13,21,"command"],[22,34,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12991,"text":"So that's the same thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12992,"text":"So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract <EXPRESSION> from it.","label":[[40,48,"command"],[49,61,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12993,"text":"That's just = <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[14,26,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12994,"text":"So this is not a problem, and I'll put some parentheses around it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12995,"text":"Now you're supposed to recognize, all of a sudden, what pattern this fits into.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12996,"text":"This is the thing which we need to calculate in order to calculate the derivative of the log function.","label":[[57,66,"command"],[67,81,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12997,"text":"So this is, in the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to ,<EXPRESSION> = the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[28,40,"expression"],[50,61,"expression"],[83,95,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12998,"text":"Where?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":12999,"text":"Well the base point is <EQUATION>.","label":[[23,33,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13000,"text":"That's where we're evaluating it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13001,"text":"That's the <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[11,23,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13002,"text":"That's the base value.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13003,"text":"So this is the difference quotient.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13004,"text":"That's exactly what it is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13005,"text":"And so this by definition tends to the limit here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13006,"text":"But we know what the derivative of the log function is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13007,"text":"The derivative of the log function is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[38,50,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13008,"text":"So this limit is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[17,29,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13009,"text":"So we got it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13010,"text":"We got the limit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13011,"text":"And now we just have to work backwards to figure out what this limit that we've got over here is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13012,"text":"So let's do that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13013,"text":"So let's see here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13014,"text":"The log approached <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13015,"text":"So the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,28,"expression"],[37,49,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13016,"text":"So sorry, the log of this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13017,"text":"Yeah, let's write it this way.","label":[[12,17,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13018,"text":"It's the same thing, as well, the thing that we know is the log of this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13019,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","label":[[0,12,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13020,"text":"And goes to infinity.","label":[[12,20,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13021,"text":"That's the one that we just figured out.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13022,"text":"But now this thing is the exponential of that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13023,"text":"So it's really <EXPRESSION> to this power here.","label":[[15,27,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13024,"text":"So this guy is the same as the limit of the log of the limit of the thing, which is the same as log of the limit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13025,"text":"The limit of the log and the log of the limit are the same.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13026,"text":"<EQUATION>.","label":[[0,10,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13027,"text":"Okay, so I take the logarithm, then I'm going to take the exponential.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13028,"text":"That just undoes what I did before.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13029,"text":"And so this limit is just <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[26,37,"expression"],[51,63,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13030,"text":"And so the limit that we want here = .","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13031,"text":"So I claim that with this step, we've actually closed the loop, finally.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13032,"text":"Because we have an honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[43,51,"command"],[53,65,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13033,"text":"The first.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13034,"text":"There are many such.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13035,"text":"But this one is a perfectly honest numerical way to calculate <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[52,61,"command"],[62,74,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13036,"text":"We had this thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13037,"text":"We didn't know exactly what it was.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13038,"text":"It was this <EXPRESSION>, there was <EXPRESSION>, the logarithm, and so on.","label":[[12,23,"expression"],[36,48,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13039,"text":"We have all that stuff.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13040,"text":"But we really need to nail down what this number <EXPRESSION> is.","label":[[49,61,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13041,"text":"And this is telling us, if you take for example <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be a very good, perfectly decent anyway, approximation to <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[31,35,"command"],[48,60,"expression"],[136,148,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13042,"text":"So this is a numerical approximation, which is all we can ever do with just this kind of irrational number.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13043,"text":"And so that closes the loop, and we now have a coherent family of functions, which are actually well defined and for which we have practical methods to calculate.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13044,"text":"Okay, see you next time.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
