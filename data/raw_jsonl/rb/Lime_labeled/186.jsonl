{"id":13726,"text":"Put it in a box.","label":[[0,3,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13727,"text":"And let me just describe what it means, first.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13728,"text":"And then I'll describe what it means again, and several other times.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13729,"text":"So, first of all, what it means is that if you have a curve, which is <EQUATION>, it's approximately the same as its tangent line.","label":[[70,80,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13749,"text":"The whole point is that these two are nearby.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13760,"text":"All right, so I want to explain this in one more way.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13761,"text":"And then we want to discuss it systematically.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13762,"text":"So the second way that I want to describe this requires me to remind you what the definition of the derivative is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13764,"text":"And this is the way we defined it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13765,"text":"And one of the things that we did in the first unit was we looked at this backwards.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13766,"text":"We used the derivative knowing the derivatives of functions to evaluate some limits.","label":[[63,71,"command"],[77,83,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13767,"text":"So you were supposed to do that on your.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13768,"text":"In our test, there were some examples there, at least one example, where that was the easiest way to do the problem.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13769,"text":"So in other words, you can read this equation both ways.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13770,"text":"This is really, of course, the same equation written twice.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13771,"text":"Now, what's new about what we're going to do now is that we're going to take this expression here, <EXPRESSION>, and we're going to say well, when <EXPRESSION> is fairly near <EXPRESSION>, this expression is going to be fairly close to the limiting value.","label":[[72,76,"command"],[82,92,"command_attribute"],[99,111,"expression"],[147,159,"expression"],[175,187,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13772,"text":"So this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[25,37,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13773,"text":"So that, I claim, is the same as what's in the box in pink that I have over here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13774,"text":"So this approximation formula here is the same as this one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13775,"text":"This is an average rate of change, and this is an infinitesimal rate of change.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13776,"text":"And they're nearly the same.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13777,"text":"That's the claim.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13778,"text":"So you'll have various exercises in which this approximation is the useful one to use.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13779,"text":"And I will, as I said, I'll be illustrating this a little bit today.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13780,"text":"Now, let me just explain why those two formulas in the boxes are the same.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13781,"text":"So let's just start over here and explain that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13783,"text":"And now if I just write out what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to write it this way.","label":[[18,27,"command"],[47,59,"expression"],[68,80,"expression"],[95,100,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13784,"text":"Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[23,35,"expression"],[49,61,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13786,"text":"And so this is the change in <EXPRESSION>, this is just rewriting what <EXPRESSION> is.","label":[[29,41,"expression"],[71,83,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13787,"text":"And now the last step is just to put the constant on the other side.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13788,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[3,15,"expression"],[33,45,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13789,"text":"So this is exactly what I had just to begin with, right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13790,"text":"So these two are just algebraically the same statement.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13791,"text":"That's one another way of looking at it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13792,"text":"All right, so now, I want to go through some systematic discussion here of several linear approximations, which you're going to be wanting to memorize.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13793,"text":"And rather than it's being hard to memorize these, it's supposed to remind you.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13794,"text":"So that you'll have a lot of extra reinforcement in remembering derivatives of all kinds.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13795,"text":"So, when we carry out these systematic discussions, we want to make things absolutely as simple as possible.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13796,"text":"And so one of the things that we do is we always use the base point to be <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[74,86,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13797,"text":"So I'm always going to have <EQUATION> in this standard list of formulas that I'm going to use.","label":[[28,38,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13799,"text":"It becomes <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[11,23,"expression"],[27,39,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13800,"text":"So this is probably the form that you'll want to remember most.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13801,"text":"That's again, just the linear approximation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13802,"text":"But one always has to remember, and this is a very important thing, this one only worked near <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[94,106,"expression"],[110,122,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13804,"text":"So that's a little addition that you need to throw in.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13805,"text":"So this one works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[23,35,"expression"],[44,56,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13806,"text":"You can't expect it to be true far away.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13807,"text":"The curve can go anywhere it wants, when it's far away from the point of tangency.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13816,"text":"Again, this is when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[20,32,"expression"],[50,62,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13823,"text":"Now, exactly what we mean by small will also be explained.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13984,"text":"That this approximation is giving us something a little simpler to deal with.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13986,"text":"I want to, I'll find the linear approximation near <EQUATION>.","label":[[16,20,"command"],[21,45,"command_attribute"],[51,61,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13990,"text":"OK.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":13991,"text":"Now, what I claim I want to use for the purposes of this approximation, are just the sum of the approximation formulas that we've already derived.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13993,"text":"So I'm not going to do any calculus, I'm just going to remember.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":13998,"text":"And we're going to carry out this approximation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14000,"text":"Namely, I'm going to write it as a product.","label":[[21,26,"command"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14012,"text":"So now this isn't where things stop.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14013,"text":"And indeed, in this kind of arithmetic that I'm describing now, things are easier than they are in ordinary algebra, in arithmetic.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14014,"text":"The reason is that there's another step, which I'm now going to perform.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14017,"text":"In fact, I didn't even have to work it out.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14018,"text":"Because I'm going to throw it away.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14019,"text":"So the reason is that already, when I passed from this expression to this one, that is from this type of thing to this thing, I was already throwing away quadratic and higher-ordered terms.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14022,"text":"I have to ignore all of them if I'm going to ignore some of them.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14023,"text":"And in fact, I only want to be left with the linear stuff.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14024,"text":"Because that's all I'm really getting a valid computation for.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14025,"text":"So, this is approximately <EXPRESSION> minus, so let's see.","label":[[26,38,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14026,"text":"It's a total of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,28,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14027,"text":"And this is the answer.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14028,"text":"This is the linear part.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14029,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> term is negligible.","label":[[7,19,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14030,"text":"So we drop <EXPRESSION> term.","label":[[6,10,"command"],[11,23,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14031,"text":"Terms, and higher.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14032,"text":"All of those terms should be lower-order.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14033,"text":"If you imagine <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or maybe <EXPRESSION>, then these terms will end up being much smaller.","label":[[15,27,"expression"],[31,43,"expression"],[54,66,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14034,"text":"So we have a rather crude approach.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14035,"text":"And that's really the simplicity, and that's the savings.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14036,"text":"So now, since this unit is called Applications, and these are indeed applications to math, I also wanted to give you a real-life application.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14037,"text":"Or a place where linear approximations come up in real life.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14038,"text":"So maybe we'll call this Example 4.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14039,"text":"This is supposedly a real-life example.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14040,"text":"I'll try to persuade you that it is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14041,"text":"So I like this example because it's got a lot of math, as well as physics in it.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14042,"text":"So here I am, on the surface of the earth.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14043,"text":"And here is a satellite going this way.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14044,"text":"At some velocity, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[18,30,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14045,"text":"And this satellite has a clock on it because this is a GPS satellite.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14046,"text":"And it has a time, <EXPRESSION>, OK?","label":[[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14047,"text":"But I have a watch, in fact it's right here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14048,"text":"And I have a time which I keep.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14049,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>, And there's an interesting relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is called time dilation.","label":[[9,21,"expression"],[71,83,"expression"],[88,100,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14050,"text":"And this is from special relativity.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14051,"text":"And it's the following formula.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14052,"text":"<EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> is the velocity of the satellite, and <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light.","label":[[0,10,"equation"],[18,30,"expression"],[69,81,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14053,"text":"So now I'd like to get a rough idea of how different my watch is from the clock on the satellite.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14054,"text":"So I'm going to use this same approximation, we've already used it once.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14055,"text":"I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[13,18,"command"],[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14056,"text":"But now let me just remind you.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14057,"text":"The situation here is, we have something of the form <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[53,65,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14058,"text":"That's what's happening when I multiply through here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14059,"text":"So with <EQUATION>.","label":[[8,18,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14060,"text":"So in real life, of course, the expression that you're going to use the linear approximation on isn't necessarily itself linear.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14061,"text":"It can be any physical quantity.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14062,"text":"So in this case it's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[21,33,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14063,"text":"And now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately =, well again it's the same rule.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14064,"text":"There's an <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[11,23,"expression"],[33,45,"expression"],[49,61,"expression"],[74,86,"expression"],[96,108,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14065,"text":"So this is approximately, by the same rule, this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> Now, I promised you that this would be a real-life problem.","label":[[52,64,"expression"],[66,78,"expression"],[96,108,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14066,"text":"So the question is when people were designing these GPS systems, they run clocks in the satellites.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14067,"text":"You're down there, you're making your measurements, you're talking to the satellite by-- or you're receiving its signals from its radio.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14068,"text":"The question is, is this going to cause problems in the transmission.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14069,"text":"And there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14070,"text":"So in this case, what actually happened is that <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.","label":[[48,60,"expression"],[70,82,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14071,"text":"That's how fast the GPS satellites actually go.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14072,"text":"In fact, they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they could've tweaked this if they had put them at different places.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14073,"text":"Anyway, the speed of light is <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.","label":[[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14074,"text":"So this number, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,28,"expression"],[46,58,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14075,"text":"Now, if you actually keep track of how much of an error that would make in a GPS location, what you would find is maybe it's a millimeter or something like that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14076,"text":"So in fact it doesn't matter.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14077,"text":"So that's nice.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14078,"text":"But in fact the engineers who were designing these systems actually did use this very computation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14079,"text":"Exactly this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14080,"text":"And the way that they used it was, they decided that because the clocks were different, when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency, that frequency would be shifted.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14081,"text":"Would be offset.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14082,"text":"And they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of, exactly this, offset.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14083,"text":"To compensate for the way the signal is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14084,"text":"So from the point of view of good reception on your little GPS device, they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites, according to exactly this rule.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14085,"text":"And incidentally, the reason why they didn't-- they ignored higher-order terms, the sort of quadratic terms, is that if you take <EXPRESSION> that's a size <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[124,128,"command"],[129,141,"expression"],[156,168,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14086,"text":"And that really is totally negligible.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14087,"text":"That doesn't matter to any measurement at all.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14088,"text":"That's on the order of nanometers, and it's not important for any of the uses to which GPS is put.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14089,"text":"OK, so that's a real example of a use of linear approximations.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14090,"text":"So.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14100,"text":"So the answer is, yes, it's also true that if I call this function <EXPRESSION>, then it must be true that the linear approximation is <EXPRESSION> of - I'm sorry, it's at <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[67,79,"expression"],[135,147,"expression"],[172,184,"expression"],[194,206,"expression"],[208,220,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14103,"text":"It's up there in the pink also.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14108,"text":"So that's no surprise.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14114,"text":"This is faster than doing that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14135,"text":"But now we're going to change it to quadratic.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14142,"text":"But there's a factor of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14145,"text":"This time I'll spell 'linear' correctly.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14160,"text":"<EXPRESSION> or something like that.","label":[[0,12,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14175,"text":"For the quadratic part.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14179,"text":"So this is what I'm going to need to compute.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14180,"text":"So if I do it, for example, for the sine function, I already have the linear part.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14181,"text":"I need this last bit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14190,"text":"It's also the quadratic approximation.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14191,"text":"For the cosine function, if you differentiate twice, you get the derivative is minus the sign and derivative of that is minus the cosine.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
