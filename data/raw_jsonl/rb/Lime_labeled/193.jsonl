{"id":14714,"text":"So, this is about trigonometry, and maybe first thing I'll do is remind you of some basic things about trigonometry.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14715,"text":"So, if I have a circle, trigonometry is all based on the circle of radius 1 and centered at the origin.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14717,"text":"And so that leads right away to some trig identities, which you know very well.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14746,"text":"So let's solve for that.","label":[[9,14,"command"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14768,"text":"So that's our starting point.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14769,"text":"And the game today, for the first half of the lecture, is to use that basic-- just those basic integration formulas, together with clever use of trig identities in order to compute more complicated formulas involving trig functions.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14770,"text":"So the first thing, the first topic, is to think about integrals of the form <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[77,89,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14771,"text":"Where here I have in mind <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are non-negative integers.","label":[[26,38,"expression"],[43,55,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14772,"text":"So let's try to integrate these.","label":[[16,25,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14773,"text":"I'll show you some applications of these pretty soon.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14774,"text":"Looking down the road a little bit, integrals like this show up in Fourier series and many other subjects in mathematics.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14775,"text":"It turns out they're quite important to be able to do.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14776,"text":"So that's why we're doing them now.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14777,"text":"Well, so there are two cases to think about here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14778,"text":"When you're integrating things like this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14779,"text":"There's the easy case, and let's do that one first.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14780,"text":"The easy case is when at least one exponent is odd.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14781,"text":"That's the easy case.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14782,"text":"So, for example, suppose that I wanted to integrate, well, let's take the case <EQUATION>.","label":[[65,69,"command"],[79,89,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14783,"text":"So I'm integrating <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[19,31,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14784,"text":"I'm taking-- Oh, I could do that one.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14785,"text":"Let's see if that's what I want to take.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14786,"text":"Yeah.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14787,"text":"My confusion is that I meant to have this a different power.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14788,"text":"You were thinking that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14789,"text":"So let's do this case when <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[27,39,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14790,"text":"So the integral I'm trying to do is any power of the <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[53,65,"expression"],[66,71,"command"],[76,88,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14791,"text":"Well, here's the trick.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14792,"text":"Recognize, use this formula up at the top there to see <EXPRESSION> as something that we already have on the blackboard.","label":[[55,67,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14793,"text":"So, the way to exploit that is to make a substitution.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14794,"text":"And substitution is going to be <EQUATION>.","label":[[32,42,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14795,"text":"And here's why.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14796,"text":"Then this integral that I'm trying to do is the integral of <EXPRESSION>, that's already a simplification.","label":[[60,72,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14797,"text":"And then there's that <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[22,34,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14798,"text":"When you make a substitution, you've got to go all the way and replace everything in the expression by things involving this new variable that I've introduced.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14799,"text":"So I'd better get rid of the <EXPRESSION> and rewrite it in terms of <EXPRESSION> or in terms of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[14,24,"command"],[29,41,"expression"],[46,53,"command"],[69,81,"expression"],[97,109,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14800,"text":"And I can do that because <EXPRESSION>, according to that formula, is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[26,38,"expression"],[70,82,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14801,"text":"Let me put a box around that.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14802,"text":"That's our substitution.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14803,"text":"When you make a substitution, you also want to compute the differential of the variable that you substitute in.","label":[[9,13,"command"],[14,28,"command_attribute"],[47,54,"command"],[59,71,"command_attribute"],[97,107,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14804,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> that appears here is just, exactly, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[7,19,"expression"],[56,68,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14805,"text":"And I've replaced this trig integral with something that doesn't involve trig functions at all.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14806,"text":"This is a lot easier.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14807,"text":"We can just plug into what we know here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14808,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION> plus a constant, and I've done the integral.","label":[[9,20,"expression"],[21,25,"command"],[26,36,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14809,"text":"But I'm not quite done with the problem yet.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14810,"text":"Because to be nice to your reader and to yourself, you should go back at this point, probably, go back and get rid of this new variable that you introduced.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14811,"text":"You're the one who introduced this variable, you.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14812,"text":"Nobody except you, really, knows what it is.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14813,"text":"But the rest of the world knows what they asked for the first place that involved <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[82,94,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14814,"text":"So I have to go back and get rid of this.","label":[[25,35,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14815,"text":"And that's not hard to do in this case, because <EQUATION>.","label":[[48,58,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14816,"text":"And so I make this back substitution.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14817,"text":"And that's what you get.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14818,"text":"So there's the answer.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14819,"text":"OK, so the game was, I use this odd power of the <EXPRESSION> here, and I could see it appearing as the differential of the <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[23,26,"command"],[49,61,"expression"],[124,136,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14820,"text":"So that's what made this substitution work.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14821,"text":"Let's do another example to see how that works out in a slightly different case.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14822,"text":"So here's another example.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14823,"text":"Now I do have an odd power.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14824,"text":"One of the exponents is odd, so I'm in the easy case.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14825,"text":"But it's not <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[13,25,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14826,"text":"The game now is to use this trig identity to get rid of the largest even power that you can, from this odd power here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14827,"text":"So use <EQUATION>, to eliminate a lot of powers from that odd power.","label":[[3,6,"command"],[7,17,"equation"],[22,31,"command"],[41,47,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14828,"text":"Watch what happens.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14829,"text":"So this is not really a substitution or anything, this is just a trig identity.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14830,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[5,17,"expression"],[21,33,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14831,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[8,20,"expression"],[24,36,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14832,"text":"And then I have the remaining <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[30,42,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14833,"text":"And then I have <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[16,28,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14834,"text":"So let me rewrite that a little bit to see how this works out.","label":[[10,17,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14835,"text":"This is the integral of <EXPRESSION> minus, and then there's the product of these two.","label":[[24,36,"expression"],[37,42,"command"],[61,72,"command_attribute"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14836,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[7,19,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14837,"text":"So now I'm really exactly in the situation that I was in over here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14838,"text":"I've got a single power of a <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[29,41,"expression"],[45,57,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14839,"text":"It happens that it's a sine here.","label":[[23,27,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14840,"text":"But that's not going to cause any trouble, we can go ahead and play the same game that I did there.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14841,"text":"So, so far I've just been using trig identities.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14842,"text":"But now I'll use a trig substitution.","label":[[13,16,"command"],[19,36,"method"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14843,"text":"And I think I want to write these as powers of a variable.","label":[[22,27,"command"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":14844,"text":"And then this is going to be the differential of that variable.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":14846,"text":"There's the substitution.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
