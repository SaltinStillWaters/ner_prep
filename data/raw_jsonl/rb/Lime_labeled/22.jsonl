{"id": 5228, "text": "One is how fast you are going, and the other is in what direction you're going.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5276, "text": "Anyway, that's a formula we can get.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5277, "text": "OK, now, what about acceleration?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5278, "text": "So, here I should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration, the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5282, "text": "Then, I'm going to feel something.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5283, "text": "There is some force being exerted.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5284, "text": "And, in fact, there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5285, "text": "So, the definition will take effect.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5286, "text": "The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5287, "text": "So, even if the speed is constant, that means, even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same, the velocity vector can still rotate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5288, "text": "And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5289, "text": "OK, and so this is the notion of acceleration that's relevant to physics when you find <EQUATION>; that's the (a) that you have in mind here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5290, "text": "It's a vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5291, "text": "Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5292, "text": "I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5293, "text": "But, in general, that's not quite the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5294, "text": "So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5295, "text": "If we take the example of the cycloid, well, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5296, "text": "It's <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"id": 5297, "text": "And, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"id": 5298, "text": "<EXPRESSION>, OK.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"id": 5299, "text": "So, the acceleration vector is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5300, "text": "So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"id": 5301, "text": "Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"id": 5302, "text": "So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5303, "text": "It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5304, "text": "So, my point is not moving at that particular time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5305, "text": "But, it's accelerating up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5306, "text": "So, that means that actually as it comes down, first it's slowing down.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5307, "text": "Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5308, "text": "OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 227, "end_offset": 239}]}
{"id": 5309, "text": "OK, any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5310, "text": "No.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5311, "text": "OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5312, "text": "One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"id": 5313, "text": "OK, this is completely false.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5314, "text": "And, they are really not the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5315, "text": "So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5316, "text": "If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5317, "text": "And, you can get there.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5318, "text": "But, it will not be a very nice expression.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5319, "text": "There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5320, "text": "Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5321, "text": "What's more relevant might be this one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5322, "text": "This is actually the speed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5323, "text": "This one, I don't know what it means.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5324, "text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5325, "text": "So, let's continue our exploration.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5326, "text": "So, the next concept that I want to define is that of arc length.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5327, "text": "So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5328, "text": "So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5329, "text": "And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5330, "text": "So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"id": 5331, "text": "I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"id": 5332, "text": "OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 5333, "text": "And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5334, "text": "Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5335, "text": "In general, maybe you would say you start at time, <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5336, "text": "But, it's a convention.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5337, "text": "If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5338, "text": "I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 147}]}
{"id": 5339, "text": "I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5340, "text": "Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5341, "text": "So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5342, "text": "Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5343, "text": "Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5344, "text": "OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5345, "text": "And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5346, "text": "Actually, maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5347, "text": "I mean, you get to choose how you count it.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5348, "text": "But, in this case, if you are moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5349, "text": "So -- So if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5350, "text": "So, if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is, you have this nice-looking curve; how long is it?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5351, "text": "Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"id": 5352, "text": "And, to say the truth, I don't really know how to integrate that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5353, "text": "So, we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5354, "text": "However, we'll see one later using a cool trick, and multi-variable calculus.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5355, "text": "So, for now, we'll just leave the formula like that, and we don't know how long it is.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5356, "text": "Well, you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5357, "text": "But, that's the best I can offer.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5358, "text": "Now, another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5359, "text": "So, the usual notation is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 5360, "text": "It has a hat because it's a unit vector, and <EXPRESSION> because it's tangent.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"id": 5361, "text": "Now, how do we get this unit vector?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5362, "text": "So, maybe I should have pointed out before that if you're moving along some trajectory, say you're going in that direction, then when you're at this point, the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5363, "text": "It tells you the direction of motion in particular.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5364, "text": "So, if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is rescale it, so, at its length becomes one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5365, "text": "So, it's <EXPRESSION> divided by a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}]}

{"id": 5424, "text": "OK.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5425, "text": "So, what happens next?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5426, "text": "OK, so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because, after all, a lot of what's here you can just do in coordinates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5427, "text": "And, we don't really need vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5428, "text": "Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5429, "text": "So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5430, "text": "So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 5431, "text": "So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5432, "text": "But, still I think it's a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5433, "text": "So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5434, "text": "Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5435, "text": "But maybe it's more complicated than that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5436, "text": "We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5437, "text": "They have more and more complicated theories.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5438, "text": "And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5439, "text": "So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5440, "text": "So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5441, "text": "And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5442, "text": "Sorry, is swept at constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5443, "text": "From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5444, "text": "OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5445, "text": "OK, so let me explain again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5446, "text": "So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5447, "text": "Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5448, "text": "So, this is supposed to be light blue.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5449, "text": "Can you see that it's different from white?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5450, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5451, "text": "OK, me neither.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5452, "text": "[LAUGHTER] OK, it doesn't really matter.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5453, "text": "So, the planet moves on its orbit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5454, "text": "And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5455, "text": "Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5456, "text": "And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5457, "text": "So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5458, "text": "And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5459, "text": "So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5460, "text": "And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5461, "text": "But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5462, "text": "So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5463, "text": "That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5464, "text": "So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5465, "text": "And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5466, "text": "At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5467, "text": "So, let's try to see, what does Kepler's law say in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5468, "text": "OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5469, "text": "Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5470, "text": "So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5471, "text": "OK, so let's start with the first step.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5472, "text": "What's the most complicated thing in here?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5473, "text": "It's this area swept out by the line.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5474, "text": "How do we express that area in terms of vectors?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5475, "text": "Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5476, "text": "If I take a sufficiently small amount of time, this shaded part looks like a triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5477, "text": "So, we have to find the area of the triangle.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5478, "text": "Well, we know how to do that now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5479, "text": "So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5480, "text": "And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5481, "text": "OK, so, I should say, this is the area swept in time <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"id": 5482, "text": "You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 5483, "text": "I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5484, "text": "So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"id": 5485, "text": "So, let's use that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5486, "text": "Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"id": 5487, "text": "I can take out the <EXPRESSION>, which is scalar.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 5488, "text": "So, now, what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5489, "text": "It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"id": 5490, "text": "So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 91}]}
{"id": 5491, "text": "OK, <EXPRESSION> has constant length.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 5492, "text": "Any questions about that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5493, "text": "No?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5494, "text": "Yes?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5495, "text": "Yes, let me try to explain that again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5496, "text": "So, what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross products <EXPRESSION> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"id": 5497, "text": "I should say, with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5498, "text": "How do we see that?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5499, "text": "Well, let's take a small time interval, <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}]}

{"id": 5504, "text": "So, its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5505, "text": "That's the formula we've seen for the area of a triangle in space.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5506, "text": "So, the area is one half of the cross product, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, magnitude of the cross product.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 5507, "text": "So, to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5509, "text": "And so, this is constant.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5510, "text": "OK, now, what about the other half of the law?", "entities": []}
{"id": 5511, "text": "Well, it says that the motion is in a plane, and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5512, "text": "And, it contains, also, the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5513, "text": "And, it contains the trajectory.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5515, "text": "Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5516, "text": "OK, that's what we are saying.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5517, "text": "But, there is another vector that I know it is in the plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5518, "text": "You could say the position vector at another time, or at any time, but in fact, what's also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5522, "text": "Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5523, "text": "So, it's normal to the plane of motion.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5524, "text": "And, that means, now, that actually we've put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <EXPRESSION> has constant length and constant direction.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"id": 5525, "text": "In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5526, "text": "So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5527, "text": "And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5528, "text": "If you want, it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5529, "text": "Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5530, "text": "It's, however, instant, if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5531, "text": "And, to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5532, "text": "OK, so -- [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] OK, so, Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that <EQUATION>, OK?", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"id": 5533, "text": "That's what the law says.", "entities": []}

{"id": 5537, "text": "The guy on the right stays on the right.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5538, "text": "OK, so, if you know that <EXPRESSION>, then you are safe.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}]}

{"id": 5559, "text": "Well, what we know now is that, of course, the attraction is towards the sun.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5560, "text": "But, Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were going away.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5561, "text": "So, in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge.", "entities": []}
{"id": 5562, "text": "So, actually, if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field caused by a point charged particle, it also satisfies Kepler's law, satisfies the same law.", "entities": []}
