{"id":6044,"text":"That will come in a while.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6045,"text":"So, well, maybe we want to understand first what happens if we move inside the level curve, OK?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6046,"text":"So, let's imagine that we are taking a moving point that stays on the level curve or on the level surface.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6047,"text":"And then, we know, well, what happens is that the function stays constant.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6051,"text":"So, let's think about what that means.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6052,"text":"So, just to get you used to this idea, I'm going to draw a level surface of a function of three variables.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6053,"text":"OK, so it's a surface given by the equation <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[44,56,"expression"],[74,86,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6054,"text":"And, so now I'm going to have a point on that, and it's going to move on that surface.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6055,"text":"So, I will have some parametric curve that lives on this surface.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6056,"text":"So, the question is, what's going to happen at any given time?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6057,"text":"Well, the first observation is that the velocity vector, what can I say about the velocity vector of this motion?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6058,"text":"It's going to be tangent to the level surface, right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6059,"text":"If I move on a surface, then at any point, my velocity is tangent to the curve.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6062,"text":"Maybe I should draw a bigger picture.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6074,"text":"That curve might be complicated, but it stays always on the level, <EQUATION>.","label":[[67,77,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6148,"text":"OK, let me give just another reason why, another way that we could have seen this.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6150,"text":"So, here's another way.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6151,"text":"So, the other way to do it would be to start with a differential, OK?","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6219,"text":"Then, it means we'll move along the line <EXPRESSION> = some initial value, the point where we are actually at the directional derivative <EXPRESSION>, or I meant to say <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[41,53,"expression"],[138,150,"expression"],[170,182,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6220,"text":"And, <EQUATION>.","label":[[5,15,"equation"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6221,"text":"And then, we plug that into <EXPRESSION>.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6222,"text":"And then we take the derivative.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6223,"text":"So, we have a notation for that which is going to be <EXPRESSION> with a subscript in the direction of u to indicate in which direction we are actually going to move.","label":[[53,65,"equation"],[103,104,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6224,"text":"And, that's called the directional derivative -- -- in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[72,84,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6225,"text":"OK, so, let's see what it means geometrically.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6226,"text":"So, remember, we've seen things about partial derivatives, and we see that the partial derivatives are the slopes of slices of the graph by vertical planes that are parallel to the x or the y directions.","label":[[181,182,"term"],[190,191,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6227,"text":"OK, so, if I have a point, at any point, I can slice the graph of my function by two planes, one that's going along the x, one along the y direction.","label":[[47,52,"command"],[120,121,"term"],[137,138,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6228,"text":"And then, I can look at the slices of the graph.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6229,"text":"Let me see if I can use that thing.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6230,"text":"So, we can look at the slices of the graph that are drawn here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6231,"text":"In fact, we look at the tangent lines to the slices, and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6233,"text":"It's not really colorful, something more colorful.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6234,"text":"We'll be slicing things by a plane that is now in the direction of this vector, <EXPRESSION>, and we'll be looking at the slope of the slice of the graph.","label":[[80,92,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6236,"text":"So, now, I'm picking a point on the contour plot.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6237,"text":"And, at that point, I slice the graph.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6238,"text":"So, here I'm starting by slicing in the direction of the x axis.","label":[[57,58,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6239,"text":"So, in fact, what I'm measuring here by the slope of the slice is the partial in the x direction.","label":[[85,86,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6240,"text":"It's really <EXPRESSION>, which is also the directional derivative in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[12,24,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6241,"text":"And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have all of these planes.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6242,"text":"So, you see at the bottom left, I have the direction in which I'm going.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6243,"text":"There's this, like, rotating line that tells you in which direction I'm going to be moving.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6244,"text":"And for each direction, I have a plane.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6245,"text":"And, when I slice by that plane, I will get, so I have this direction here going maybe to the southwest.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6246,"text":"So, that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane, and the slice has a certain slope.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6247,"text":"And, the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6248,"text":"OK, I think that's as graphic as I can get.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6249,"text":"OK, any questions about that?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6250,"text":"No?","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6251,"text":"OK, so let's see how we compute that guy.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6252,"text":"So, let me just write again just in case you want to, in case you didn't hear me it's the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane -- -- that contains the given direction, that's parallel to the direction, u.","label":[[217,218,"term"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6256,"text":"But, remember we say that we are going to be moving at unit speed in the direction of u.","label":[[86,87,"term"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6260,"text":"And, maybe that makes more sense.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6261,"text":"So, for example, the directional derivative in the direction of I hat is the component along the x axes.","label":[[64,69,"term"],[97,98,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6262,"text":"That's the same as, indeed, the partial derivatives in the x direction.","label":[[59,60,"term"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6263,"text":"Things make sense.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6265,"text":"OK, now, so that's basically what we need to know to compute these guys.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6280,"text":"So, this is largest when the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[29,41,"expression"],[45,57,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6281,"text":"That means the angle is <EXPRESSION>.","label":[[24,36,"expression"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6282,"text":"That means u is actually in the direction of the gradient.","label":[[11,12,"term"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6290,"text":"It's going in the opposite direction, right?","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6306,"text":"And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6307,"text":"So, let me just show that on the picture here.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6309,"text":"I need to move it a bit.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6319,"text":"OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6320,"text":"The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
