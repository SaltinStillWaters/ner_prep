{"id":7803,"text":"But I think maybe you've spent some time computing the derivative of the sine function as well, recently.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7814,"text":"That's the program.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7815,"text":"So let's begin by talking about the product rule.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7819,"text":"Differentiating a product gives you a sum.","label":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7863,"text":"But I'm still not quite there, because I haven't put this in yet.","label":[],"Comments":[]}
