{"id": 6241, "text": "And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have all of these planes.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6243, "text": "There's this, like, rotating line that tells you in which direction I'm going to be moving.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6244, "text": "And for each direction, I have a plane.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6245, "text": "And, when I slice by that plane, I will get, so I have this direction here going maybe to the southwest.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6246, "text": "So, that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane, and the slice has a certain slope.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6247, "text": "And, the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6252, "text": "So, let me just write again just in case you want to, in case you didn't hear me it's the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane -- -- that contains the given direction, that's parallel to the direction, u.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 218}]}
{"id": 6253, "text": "So, how do we compute it?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6254, "text": "Well, we can use the chain rule.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}

{"id": 6269, "text": "That should calm you down.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6274, "text": "But now, what does that tell us?", "entities": []}

{"id": 6284, "text": "The gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6285, "text": "So, the direction of gradient <EXPRESSION> is the direction of fastest increase of <EXPRESSION> at the given point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6286, "text": "And, what is the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"id": 6287, "text": "Well, it's actually the directional derivative in that direction.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6288, "text": "OK, so if I go in that direction, which gives me the fastest increase, then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6289, "text": "And, with the direction of the fastest decrease?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6290, "text": "It's going in the opposite direction, right?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6291, "text": "I mean, if you are on a mountain, and you know that you are facing the mountain, that's the direction of fastest increase.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6292, "text": "The direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6293, "text": "OK, so, the minimal value of <EXPRESSION> is achieved when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 41}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"id": 6294, "text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 6295, "text": "That means <EXPRESSION> is in the direction of minus the gradient.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"id": 6296, "text": "It points opposite to the gradient.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6297, "text": "And, finally, when do we have <EQUATION>?", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"id": 6298, "text": "So, in which direction does the function not change?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6299, "text": "Well, we have two answers to that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6300, "text": "One is to just use the formula.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6301, "text": "So, that's <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 6302, "text": "That means <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 6303, "text": "That means that <EXPRESSION> is perpendicular to the gradient.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 6304, "text": "The other way to think about it, the direction in which the value doesn't change is a direction that's tangent to the level surface.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6305, "text": "If we are not changing a, it means we are moving along the level.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"id": 6306, "text": "And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6307, "text": "So, let me just show that on the picture here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6308, "text": "So, if actually show you the gradient, you can't really see it here.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6309, "text": "I need to move it a bit.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6310, "text": "So, the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that I have chosen.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6311, "text": "Now, if I choose a slice that's perpendicular, and a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient, so that's actually tangent to the level curve, then you see that my slice is flat.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6312, "text": "I don't actually have any slop.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6313, "text": "The directional derivative in a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient is basically <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"id": 6314, "text": "Now, if I rotate, then the slope sort of increases, increases, increases, and it becomes the largest when I'm going in the direction of a gradient.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 6315, "text": "So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6316, "text": "And now, if I keep rotating, then the slope will decrease again.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6317, "text": "Then it becomes <EXPRESSION> when I perpendicular, and then it becomes negative.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 6318, "text": "It's the most negative when I pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <EXPRESSION> again when I'm back perpendicular.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 91}]}
{"id": 6319, "text": "OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6320, "text": "The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6321, "text": "And, it would be going towards higher values of a function.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6322, "text": "I don't know if you can see the labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6323, "text": "So, it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction.", "entities": []}
