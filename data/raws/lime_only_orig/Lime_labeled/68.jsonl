{"id": 6756, "text": "So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6757, "text": "So, that's the main topic for today.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6758, "text": "So, remember yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of several variables.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6759, "text": "And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"id": 6760, "text": "That's a point where the partial derivatives are both <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"id": 6761, "text": "And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6762, "text": "There's local minima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6763, "text": "So, maybe I should show the function on this contour plot, there is local maxima, which are like that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6764, "text": "And, there's saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6765, "text": "And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6766, "text": "It will have several critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6767, "text": "So, this example here, well, you see on the plot that there is two maxima.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6768, "text": "And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6769, "text": "And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6770, "text": "On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6771, "text": "And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6772, "text": "It crosses itself.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6773, "text": "And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"id": 6774, "text": "Along the x direction, the values will increase.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"id": 6775, "text": "So, you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6776, "text": "So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6777, "text": "Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6778, "text": "So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6779, "text": "So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6780, "text": "So, and, in fact, why do we care?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6781, "text": "Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum/maximum of a function?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6782, "text": "So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6783, "text": "For example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6784, "text": "Well, we have two obvious candidates.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6785, "text": "We have this local maximum and that local maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6786, "text": "And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6787, "text": "Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6788, "text": "But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6789, "text": "Well, four wins.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6790, "text": "The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6791, "text": "So, where's the minimum?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6792, "text": "Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6793, "text": "So, that's another feature.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6794, "text": "The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6795, "text": "It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6796, "text": "So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6797, "text": "So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6798, "text": "So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6799, "text": "And so, we have to try both.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6800, "text": "OK, but so we'll get back to that.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6801, "text": "For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6802, "text": "So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6803, "text": "And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6804, "text": "If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6805, "text": "And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6806, "text": "And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6807, "text": "So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6808, "text": "But, it will again involve the second derivative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6809, "text": "OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6810, "text": "OK, so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function that's actually just quadratic.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6811, "text": "So, let's say I have a function, <EXPRESSION> that's of the form <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 6812, "text": "OK, so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well, and if you plug <EQUATION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 85}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 114}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 138, "end_offset": 148}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 161, "end_offset": 173}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 212}]}

{"id": 6815, "text": "OK, so, how do we do it?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6816, "text": "Well, yesterday we actually did an example.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6817, "text": "It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it, so remember, we were looking at something that started with <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 119, "end_offset": 131}]}
{"id": 6818, "text": "And, there were other terms.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6819, "text": "But, let's forget them now.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6820, "text": "And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"id": 6821, "text": "And now, this is a sum of two squares.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6867, "text": "OK, so that's a lot of terms.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6868, "text": "But, what does it look like?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6869, "text": "Well, it looks like, so we have some constant factors, and here we have a square, and here we have a square.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6870, "text": "So, basically, we've written this as a sum of two squares, well, a sum or a difference of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6871, "text": "And, maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because, see, if you take a sum of two squares, that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6872, "text": "And you will have, the function will always take nonnegative values.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6873, "text": "So, the origin will be a minimum.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6874, "text": "Well, if you have a difference of two squares that typically you'll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger, you will have a positive or a negative quantity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6875, "text": "OK, so I claim there's various cases to look at.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6876, "text": "So, let's see.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6877, "text": "So, in fact, I claim there will be three cases.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6878, "text": "And, that's good news for us because after all, we want to distinguish between three possibilities.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6879, "text": "So, let's first do away with the most complicated one.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6880, "text": "What if <EXPRESSION> is negative?", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 6881, "text": "Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is, so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity, while the second one will be something negative times <EXPRESSION>.", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 180, "end_offset": 192}]}
{"id": 6882, "text": "So, it will be a negative quantity.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6883, "text": "OK, so one term is positive.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6884, "text": "The other is negative.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6885, "text": "That tells us we actually have a saddle point.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6886, "text": "We have, in fact, written our function as a difference of two squares.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6887, "text": "OK, is that convincing?", "entities": []}
{"id": 6888, "text": "So, if you want, what I could do is actually I could change my coordinates, have new coordinates called <EQUATION>, actually, well, I could keep y, and that it would look like the difference of squares directly.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6889, "text": "OK, so that's the first case.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6890, "text": "The second case is where <EQUATION>.", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"id": 6891, "text": "Well, what happens if that's zero?", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"id": 6892, "text": "Then it means that this term over there goes away.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6893, "text": "So, what we have is just one square.", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 6894, "text": "OK, so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things.", "entities": []}
{"id": 6895, "text": "In the other direction, it's going to actually be degenerate.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6902, "text": "OK, basically it's a valley whose bottom is completely flat.", "entities": []}

{"id": 6907, "text": "I mean, it will still get this degenerate behavior.", "entities": []}
