{"id":63316,"text":"If you drop this hypothesis, it's totally false.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63318,"text":"I mean, it's hard to express it any further than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63319,"text":"So look, in many cases we tell you formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63320,"text":"And in many cases it's so obvious when they're true that we don't have to worry about what we say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63321,"text":"And indeed, there's something implicit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63322,"text":"I'm saying well, you know, if I wrote this symbol down, it must mean that the thing exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63323,"text":"So that's a subtle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63324,"text":"But what I'm emphasizing is that you don't need to know in advance that this <EXPRESSION> exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63325,"text":"You do need to know in advance that that <EXPRESSION> exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63326,"text":"Essentially, yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63327,"text":"So that's the direction that it goes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63328,"text":"You can't get away with not having this exist and still have the statement be true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63329,"text":"Alright, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63330,"text":"Thank you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63334,"text":"Nevertheless, this theorem applies.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63335,"text":"And we'll be able to use it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63336,"text":"Over here, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, neither of these well, actually, come to think of it, <EXPRESSION>, if you like, it's = <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63337,"text":"If you want to say that it has a value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63338,"text":"But in fact, these expressions don't necessarily have values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63339,"text":"At the ends.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63340,"text":"And nevertheless, the theorem applies.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63341,"text":"I mean, it can exist.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63342,"text":"It's perfectly OK for it to exist.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63343,"text":"It's no problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63344,"text":"It just doesn't need to exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63345,"text":"It isn't forced to exist.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63346,"text":"So here's a calculation which we just did.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63347,"text":"And we evaluated this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63348,"text":"Now, I want to make a comparison with the method of approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63350,"text":"We would use <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84752,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63351,"text":"We would use that linear approximation.","entities":[{"id":84753,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63352,"text":"And then what we would have here is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, which is of course <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63356,"text":"And for this <EXPRESSION>, you have to remember the approximation near <EQUATION> to the cosine function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63357,"text":"And that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63359,"text":"And now, sure enough, this simplifies.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63360,"text":"This becomes <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63361,"text":"So we get the same answer, which is a good thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63362,"text":"Because both of these methods are valid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63363,"text":"They're consistent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63364,"text":"You can see that neither of them is particularly a lot longer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63365,"text":"You may have trouble remembering this property.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63366,"text":"But in fact it's something that you can easily derive.","entities":[{"id":84755,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":53}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63368,"text":"They're almost the same amount of numerical content to them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63369,"text":"So now what I'd like to do is explain to you why L'Hopital's Rule works better in some cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63370,"text":"And the real value that it has is in handling these other more exotic limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63371,"text":"So now we're going to do L'Hopital's Rule over again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63372,"text":"And I'll handle these functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63373,"text":"But I'll have to rewrite them, but we'll just do that.","entities":[{"id":84757,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63374,"text":"So here's the property.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63375,"text":"That the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63376,"text":"That's the property.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63377,"text":"And this is what we'll always be using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63378,"text":"Very convenient thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63379,"text":"And remember it was true provided that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63380,"text":"And that the right-hand side exists.","entities":[{"id":84760,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":13,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63381,"text":"But I claim that it works better, and I'll get rid of these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63382,"text":"But I'll write them again to show you that it works for these.","entities":[{"id":84762,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63383,"text":"So there are other cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63384,"text":"And the other cases that are allowed are this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63385,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, as indicated by what I just erased, you can allow <EXPRESSION> to be = <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63386,"text":"It's also OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63387,"text":"So you can take the limit going to the far ends of the universe.","entities":[{"id":84763,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63388,"text":"Both left and right.","entities":[{"id":84764,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":5,"end_offset":9},{"id":84765,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":14,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63389,"text":"And then the other thing that you can do is, you can allow <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> to be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63390,"text":"Is OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63392,"text":"That's a very powerful tool, and quite different from the other cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63393,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing is that the right-hand side doesn't really quite have to exist, in the ordinary sense.","entities":[{"id":84766,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":39,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63395,"text":"That's also OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63396,"text":"That's still information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63397,"text":"So if we can see where it goes, then we're still good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63398,"text":"If it goes to <EXPRESSION>, if it goes to <EXPRESSION>, if it goes to a finite number, if it goes to <EXPRESSION>, all of that will be OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63399,"text":"It just if it oscillates wildly that we'll be lost.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63400,"text":"And those calculations we'll never encounter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63401,"text":"So this basically handles everything that you could possibly hope for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63402,"text":"And it's a very convenient process.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63403,"text":"So let me carry out a few examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63404,"text":"And, let's see, I guess the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> that I wanted to do was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63405,"text":"So what example are we up to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63408,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> was on our homework problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63409,"text":"In the limits of some calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63410,"text":"But so this <EXPRESSION>, you have to look at it <EXPRESSION> to think about what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63411,"text":"It's an indeterminate form, but it sort of looks like it's the wrong type.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63412,"text":"So why is it in an indeterminate form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63413,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, and this <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63414,"text":"So, excuse me, this is a product.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63415,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63417,"text":"The product could be anything in between.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63418,"text":"We just don't know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63419,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> step is to write this as a ratio of things, rather than a product of things.","entities":[{"id":84769,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63420,"text":"And it turns out that the way to do that is to use the <EXPRESSION> in the numerator, and the <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.","entities":[{"id":84770,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":50},{"id":84771,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":75,"end_offset":84},{"id":84772,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":114,"end_offset":125}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63421,"text":"So this is a choice that I'm making here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63422,"text":"Now, I've just converted it to a limit of the type <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63423,"text":"Because the numerator is going to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> and the denominator <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84773,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":84774,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":92,"end_offset":103}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63424,"text":"Again, there's a competitions, but now it's <EXPRESSION> of the forms to which L'Hopital's Rule applies.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63425,"text":"Now I'm just going to apply L'Hopital's Rule.","entities":[{"id":84775,"label":"command","start_offset":22,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63426,"text":"And what it says is that I differentiate here.","entities":[{"id":84776,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63427,"text":"So I just differentiate a numerator and denominator.","entities":[{"id":84777,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":23},{"id":84778,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":26,"end_offset":35},{"id":84779,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":40,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63430,"text":"And now it just simplifies and we're done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63431,"text":"This is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> plus of, well, the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.","entities":[{"id":84780,"label":"command","start_offset":55,"end_offset":59},{"id":84781,"label":"command","start_offset":89,"end_offset":95}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63432,"text":"This is the same as just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63433,"text":"<EXPRESSION> factors cancel.","entities":[{"id":84782,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63434,"text":"And so that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63435,"text":"The answer is that it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63436,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> faster then <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63437,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> was the winner.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63438,"text":"Something you can't necessarily predict in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63439,"text":"So let's do the other <EXPRESSION> examples that I wrote down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63440,"text":"I'm going to do them in slightly more generality, because they're the most fundamental rate properties that you're going to need to know for the next section.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63441,"text":"Which is improper integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63442,"text":"And also they're just very important for physical math, and any other kind of thing, basically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63443,"text":"So here, let's just do these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63445,"text":"So I wrote down the limit of <EXPRESSION>, but I'm going to make it even more general.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63446,"text":"I'm going to make it any negative power here, where <EXPRESSION> is some positive constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63447,"text":"Now again, this is a product of functions, not a quotient, a ratio, of functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63448,"text":"And so I need to rewrite it.","entities":[{"id":84786,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63449,"text":"I'm going to write it as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84787,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63451,"text":"And now that's the same as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63452,"text":"So where does that go?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63453,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63454,"text":"Now we can decide.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63455,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> stays where it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63456,"text":"And this, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63457,"text":"So the answer is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63458,"text":"And the conclusion is that <EXPRESSION> grows more slowly then <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63459,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63460,"text":"Remember, <EXPRESSION> is positive here, of course.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63461,"text":"It's the increasing exponentials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63462,"text":"Not the decreasing ones.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63463,"text":"Let's do a variant of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63464,"text":"I'll do it the opposite way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63466,"text":"It really doesn't give us any more information, but it gives you just a little bit more practice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63467,"text":"So suppose I look at things the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63468,"text":"<EXPRESSION> divided by, say, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84789,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":28},{"id":84790,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63469,"text":"Now, this is an <EXPRESSION> example, again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63470,"text":"And you can work out what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63471,"text":"But there are <EXPRESSION> ways of thinking about this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63472,"text":"There's the slow way and the fast way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63474,"text":"That is, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63475,"text":"Apply L'Hopital's Rule over and over and over and over again.","entities":[{"id":84792,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63476,"text":"All the way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63477,"text":"It's clear that you could do it, but it's kind of a nuisance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63478,"text":"So there's a much cleverer trick here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63481,"text":"And that <EXPRESSION> is that this is the same as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of, well it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63482,"text":"That's our L'Hopital's step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63483,"text":"And of course, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63484,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63485,"text":"Now, again I did this in a slightly different way to show you that it works with infinity as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63486,"text":"So that was this other case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63487,"text":"The right-hand side can exist, or it can be <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84793,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":4,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63488,"text":"And that applies to this limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63489,"text":"And therefore, to the original limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63490,"text":"And the conclusion here is that <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, grows faster than any power of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63491,"text":"I picked <EXPRESSION>, but obviously it didn't matter what power I picked.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63492,"text":"The exponents beat all the powers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63493,"text":"So we have <EXPRESSION> more of the ones that I gave at the beginning to take care of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63494,"text":"And that <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63495,"text":"And its behavior at infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63496,"text":"So I'll do a slightly variant on that <EXPRESSION>, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63499,"text":"So now this, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, is of the form <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63501,"text":"And that's <EXPRESSION>, and here I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63502,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63504,"text":"So this is what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63505,"text":"And that's = to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63506,"text":"Which we can decide.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63507,"text":"It goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63508,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63510,"text":"So any <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> positive, will work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63511,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is really slow, going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63512,"text":"It's very, very gradual.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63513,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63514,"text":"The question is, how many hypotheses do you need here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63515,"text":"So I said that, and I think what you were asking is, if I have this hypothesis, can I also have this hypothesis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63516,"text":"That's OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63517,"text":"I can have this hypothesis combined with this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63519,"text":"I can't assume nothing about <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63522,"text":"A rule applies in the <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION> case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63536,"text":"It's not hard to impose this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63538,"text":"So you want to know what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63539,"text":"So you'll never have problems confirming this hypothesis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63540,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63541,"text":"Let me give you <EXPRESSION> more example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63542,"text":"Which is just slightly trickier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63544,"text":"That's going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63545,"text":"So there are lots of these things where you just don't know what to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63546,"text":"And they come out in various different ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63547,"text":"The simplest example of this is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> from above of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63556,"text":"So remember, actually we already did this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63557,"text":"But I'm going to do it once more for you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63558,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63560,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63564,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63565,"text":"So that's the answer This limit happens to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63566,"text":"That's actually relatively easy to do, given all of the power that we have at our hands.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63568,"text":"Suppose you're trying to understand the limit of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63574,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>, which goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63576,"text":"So there's something fishy going on here, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63577,"text":"So this is fishy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63578,"text":"Or maybe this is fishy, I don't know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63581,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63611,"text":"Namely, it's the same as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63613,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63662,"text":"A partial differential equation is an equation that involves the partial derivatives of a function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":63663,"text":"So you have some function that is unknown that depends on a bunch of variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63682,"text":"The reason for that is basically physics of how heat is transported between particles in fluid, or actually any medium.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":63689,"text":"And, if you want more on that <EXPRESSION>, we have many fine classes about partial differential equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64011,"text":"Plus a constant.","entities":[{"id":84947,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":4}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64012,"text":"So that's done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64013,"text":"So now, here's the difficulty that is going to arise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64014,"text":"The difficulty is that I can start with this function, which is perfectly manageable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64015,"text":"And than I can add these <EXPRESSION> functions together.","entities":[{"id":84948,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64016,"text":"The way I add fractions.","entities":[{"id":84949,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64017,"text":"So that's getting a common denominator.","entities":[{"id":84950,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":27,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64021,"text":"Hope there aren't too many more of those transformations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64022,"text":"Is there another <EXPRESSION> here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64023,"text":"Oh, it happened earlier on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64024,"text":"Wow that's an interesting vibration there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64025,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64026,"text":"Thank you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64027,"text":"So, I guess my <EXPRESSION>'s were speaking to my <EXPRESSION>'s.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64028,"text":"Somewhere in my past.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64029,"text":"OK, anyway, I think this is now correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64030,"text":"So the problem is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64031,"text":"This is the problem with this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64032,"text":"This integral was easy.","entities":[{"id":84951,"label":"method","start_offset":5,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64033,"text":"I'm calling it easy, we already know how to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64034,"text":"Over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64035,"text":"But now over here, it's disguised.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64036,"text":"It's the same function, but it's no longer clear how to integrate it.","entities":[{"id":84952,"label":"command","start_offset":56,"end_offset":65}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64037,"text":"If you're faced with this <EXPRESSION>, you say what am I supposed to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64038,"text":"And we have to get around that difficulty.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64039,"text":"And so what we're going to do is we're going to unwind this disguise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64040,"text":"So we have the algebra problem that we have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64041,"text":"Oh, wow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64042,"text":"There must be something in the water.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64043,"text":"Impressive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64044,"text":"Wow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64045,"text":"OK, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64046,"text":"Is <EQUATION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64047,"text":"Holy cow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64048,"text":"Well that's good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64049,"text":"Well, I'll keep you awake today with several other transpositions here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64050,"text":"So our algebra problem is to detect the easy pieces which are inside.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64052,"text":"But we're going to talk about even more general things than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64053,"text":"But anyway, this is where we're headed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64054,"text":"Is something called the cover-up method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64055,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64056,"text":"So that's our intro.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64057,"text":"And I'll just have to remember that <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64058,"text":"I'll keep on repeating that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64059,"text":"So now here I'm going to describe to you how we unwind this disguise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64060,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> step is, we write down the function we want to integrate.","entities":[{"id":84956,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":34},{"id":84957,"label":"command","start_offset":64,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64061,"text":"Which was this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64064,"text":"And that factors, we happen to know the factors, so I'm not going to carry this out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64065,"text":"But this can be a rather difficult step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64066,"text":"But we're going to assume that it's done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64067,"text":"For the purposes of illustration here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64068,"text":"So I factor the denominator.","entities":[{"id":84958,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":16,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64069,"text":"And now, the <EXPRESSION> thing that I'm going to do is what I'm going to call the setup here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64071,"text":"And I'll tell you what these things are more systematically in a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64072,"text":"And the setup is that I want to somehow detect what I did before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64073,"text":"And I'm going to write some unknowns here.","entities":[{"id":84960,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64076,"text":"So now, my <EXPRESSION> step is going to be to solve for <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64077,"text":"And then I'm done, if I do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64078,"text":"That's the complete unwinding of this disguise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64079,"text":"And this is where the cover-up method comes in handy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64080,"text":"This is this method that I'm about to describe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64081,"text":"Now, you can do the algebra in a clumsy way, or you can do it in a quick way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64088,"text":"And on the right-hand side you get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84962,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":11,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64089,"text":"The <EXPRESSION>'s cancel again.","entities":[{"id":84964,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64090,"text":"And then we get this extra term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64091,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64092,"text":"Now, the trick here, and we're going to get even better trick in just a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84966,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64093,"text":"The trick here is that I didn't try to clear the denominators completely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64094,"text":"I was very efficient about the way I did it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64097,"text":"Namely, if I plug in now <EQUATION>, this term drops out too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64098,"text":"So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to plug in <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64100,"text":"That's the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64101,"text":"This is my formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64102,"text":"A happens to be = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64103,"text":"And that's, of course, what I expect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64104,"text":"A had better be <EXPRESSION>, because the thing broke up into <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64105,"text":"So this is the correct answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64106,"text":"There was a question out here, which I missed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64109,"text":"That's the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64110,"text":"The answer is, they only have whole powers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64111,"text":"So for instance here I only have the power <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64112,"text":"Here I have the powers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.","entities":[{"id":84969,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":74,"end_offset":85}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64114,"text":"Another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64115,"text":"Why did I say <EQUATION>?","entities":[{"id":84971,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64116,"text":"The reason why I said <EQUATION> was that it works really fast.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64117,"text":"You can't know this in advance, that's part of the method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64118,"text":"It just turns out to be the best thing to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64119,"text":"The fastest way of getting at the coefficient A.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64120,"text":"Now the curious thing, let me just pause for a <EXPRESSION> before I do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64123,"text":"And that seems like the most horrible thing to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64124,"text":"The worst possible thing to do, is to set <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":84972,"label":"command","start_offset":38,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64125,"text":"On the other hand, what we did is a trick.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64126,"text":"We multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84973,"label":"command","start_offset":3,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64127,"text":"And that turned the equation into this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64128,"text":"So now, in disguise, I multiplied by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84974,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64129,"text":"But that turns out to be legitimate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64130,"text":"Because really this equation is true for all <EXPRESSION> except <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64132,"text":"That's really what I need.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64133,"text":"The limit is <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64134,"text":"The equation is still valid then.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64135,"text":"So I'm using the worst case, the case that looks like it's dividing by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64137,"text":"So the advantage here is this cancellation that occurs in this part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64138,"text":"So that's the method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64139,"text":"We're going to shorten it much, much more in a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64140,"text":"But let me carry it out for the other coefficient as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64141,"text":"So the other coefficient I'm going to solve for <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to multiply by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":84980,"label":"command","start_offset":75,"end_offset":83}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64144,"text":"And then again the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.","entities":[{"id":84981,"label":"command","start_offset":34,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64145,"text":"So I get <EXPRESSION> sitting alone.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64146,"text":"And now I'm going to do the same trick.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64147,"text":"I'm going to set <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":84983,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64148,"text":"That's the value which is going to knock out this <EXPRESSION> term here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64150,"text":"And what we get here all told is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64151,"text":"In other words, <EQUATION>, which was also what it was supposed to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64152,"text":"<EXPRESSION> was this number <EXPRESSION>, right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64153,"text":"Which I'm now not going to change to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64154,"text":"Because I know that it's not <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64155,"text":"There was a question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64156,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64157,"text":"Now, this is the method which is called cover-up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64158,"text":"But it's really carried out much, much faster than this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64159,"text":"So I'm going to review the method and I'm going to show you what it is in general.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64161,"text":"That's what I labeled <EXPRESSION> over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64162,"text":"That was the factorization of the denominator up top.","entities":[{"id":84988,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":34,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64163,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> step is what I'm going to call the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64165,"text":"And that's where I knew what I was aiming for in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64166,"text":"And I'm going to have to explain to you in every instance exactly what this setup should be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64167,"text":"That is, what the unknowns should be and what target, simplified expression, we're aiming for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64168,"text":"So that's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64169,"text":"And then the <EXPRESSION> step is what I'll now call cover-up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64170,"text":"Which is just a very fast way of doing what I did on this last board, which is solving for the unknown coefficients.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64171,"text":"So now, let me perform it for you again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64172,"text":"Over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64174,"text":"Handwriting it makes it much faster.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64177,"text":"Alright, that's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64178,"text":"And now I claim that without writing very much, I can figure out what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64179,"text":"Just by staring at this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64180,"text":"So now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to think what I did over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64181,"text":"And I'm just going to do it directly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64182,"text":"So let me show you what the method consists of visually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64183,"text":"I'm going to cover up, that is, knock out this factor, and focus on this number here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64184,"text":"And I'm going to plug in the thing that makes the <EXPRESSION>, which is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64185,"text":"So I'm plugging in <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64186,"text":"To this left-hand side.","entities":[{"id":84989,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":8,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64187,"text":"And what I get is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64188,"text":"Now, that's the same thing I did over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64189,"text":"I just did it by skipping the intermediate algebra step, which is a lot of writing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64190,"text":"So the cover-up method really amounts to the following thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64191,"text":"I'm thinking of multiplying this over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64192,"text":"It cancels this and it gets rid of everything else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64195,"text":"So in other words, by eliminating this, I'm isolating a on the right-hand side.","entities":[{"id":84992,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":63,"end_offset":78}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64196,"text":"So the cover-up is that I'm covering this and getting <EXPRESSION> out of it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64197,"text":"Similarly, I can do the same thing with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64198,"text":"It's focused on the value <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64199,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is what I'm getting on the right-hand side.","entities":[{"id":84993,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":44,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64200,"text":"And then I have to cover up this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64201,"text":"So if I cover up that, then what's left over with <EQUATION> is again, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64202,"text":"So this is the way the method gets carried out in practice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64203,"text":"Writing, essentially, the least you can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64205,"text":"So now, let me just review when cover-up works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64206,"text":"So this cover-up method works if <EXPRESSION> has distinct linear factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64207,"text":"And, so you need <EXPRESSION> things here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64209,"text":"And the degree of the numerator has to be strictly less than the degree of the denominator.","entities":[{"id":84997,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":22,"end_offset":31},{"id":84998,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":79,"end_offset":90}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64210,"text":"I'm going to give you an example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64211,"text":"So, for instance, and this tells you the general pattern of the setup also.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64212,"text":"Say you had <EXPRESSION>, let's say.","entities":[{"id":84999,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":3},{"id":85000,"label":"command","start_offset":32,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64214,"text":"So here I'm going to tell you the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64216,"text":"And it will always break up into something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64217,"text":"So however many factors you have, you'll have to put in a term for each of those.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64218,"text":"And then you can find each number here by this cover-up method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64219,"text":"Now we're done with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64220,"text":"And now we have to go on to the algebraic complications.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64221,"text":"So would the <EXPRESSION> typical algebraic complication be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64222,"text":"It would be repeated roots or repeated factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64225,"text":"And this is going to work when the degree, you always need that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.","entities":[{"id":85002,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":82,"end_offset":91},{"id":85003,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":123,"end_offset":134}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64226,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> has now repeated linear factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64227,"text":"So let's see which example I wanted to show you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64228,"text":"So let's just give this here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64229,"text":"I'll just repeat the denominator.","entities":[{"id":85004,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":21,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64230,"text":"With an extra factor like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64231,"text":"Now, the main thing you need to know, since I've already performed the factorization for you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64234,"text":"You have to factor things all the way, and that's already been done for you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64235,"text":"And here's what this setup is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64236,"text":"The setup is that it's of the form <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64238,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64239,"text":"In general, if you have more powers you just need to keep on putting in those powers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64241,"text":"Why does it have to be squared?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64242,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64243,"text":"Good question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64244,"text":"So why in the world am I doing this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64245,"text":"Let me just give you <EXPRESSION> hint as to why I'm doing this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64247,"text":"So, for, example the number <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, is that right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64248,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64249,"text":"It's this sort of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64250,"text":"And I'm getting this power and this power.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64264,"text":"That's what you just said.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64265,"text":"OK, now, what's different about this setup is that the cover-up method, although it works, it doesn't work so well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64272,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, I'm going to do the ordinary cover-up with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64372,"text":"The question is, how would you solve it if you have <EXPRESSION> unknowns.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64391,"text":"If you know about complex numbers this method becomes much easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64400,"text":"But anyway, it's a very convenient method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64484,"text":"In fact, that's equivalent to picking out the <EXPRESSION> term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64487,"text":"That's another way of doing this besides doing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64495,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64496,"text":"So the question is, could I have done it this other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64497,"text":"With the polynomial, with this other <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64498,"text":"Yes, absolutely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64499,"text":"So in other words what I've taught you now is <EXPRESSION> choices which are equally reasonable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64505,"text":"If this, instead of being <EXPRESSION>, this were <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64512,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64513,"text":"Isn't that what it is?I think it's right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64514,"text":"But anyway, the point is that you have to factor it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64515,"text":"And then you have a linear and a quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64554,"text":"And I'm going to save the general pattern for next time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64555,"text":"But I do want to clarify <EXPRESSION> thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64574,"text":"I'm back to the starting place here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64583,"text":"That is, that's going to match the top terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64612,"text":"So, basically the last few weeks, we've been doing derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64613,"text":"Now, we're going to integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64806,"text":"No?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64808,"text":"Here we had <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64809,"text":"And, that somehow became a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64823,"text":"Well, in principle it always works both ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64826,"text":"So, the theory is that it should work both ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64828,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":64829,"text":"Let's do another example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64833,"text":"I should stop integrating where my paraboloid hits the <EXPRESSION> plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":64845,"text":"OK, on that picture here, on this picture, it tells me for a fixed value of <EXPRESSION>, the range of values for <EXPRESSION> should go only from here to here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":65126,"text":"I think they just happen to have the same name, even though they're not that related.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65127,"text":"So the reason why this <EXPRESSION> is called homogeneous is because you have it = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65128,"text":"So this is what makes it homogeneous.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65132,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> order linear homogeneous because they = <EXPRESSION> differential equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65133,"text":"And I think you'll see that these, in some ways, are the most fun differential equations to solve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65134,"text":"And actually, often the most useful because in a lot of the applications of classical mechanics, this is all you need to solve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65135,"text":"But they're the most fun to solve because they all boil down to Algebra II problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65136,"text":"And I'll touch on that in a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65137,"text":"But let's just think about this a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65138,"text":"Think about what the properties of these solutions might be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65139,"text":"Let me just throw out something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65140,"text":"Let's say that <EXPRESSION> is a solution.","entities":[{"id":85335,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65141,"text":"So that means that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65142,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65143,"text":"These mean the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65144,"text":"Now, my question to you is, what if I have some constant times <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[{"id":85336,"label":"command","start_offset":57,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65145,"text":"Is that still a solution?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65146,"text":"So my question is, let's say some constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is this a solution?","entities":[{"id":85337,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65147,"text":"Well, let's try it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65150,"text":"And let's see whether this = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65151,"text":"So we could factor out that <EXPRESSION> constant, and we get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85338,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":85339,"label":"command","start_offset":58,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65152,"text":"And lo and behold, we already know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65153,"text":"Because we know that <EXPRESSION> is a solution, we know that this is true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65154,"text":"So this is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65155,"text":"Because <EXPRESSION> is a solution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65156,"text":"So if this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is going to be = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65158,"text":"Or another way to view it is that if <EXPRESSION> is a solution to this <EXPRESSION> order linear homogeneous differential equation, then some constant times <EXPRESSION> is also a solution.","entities":[{"id":85340,"label":"command","start_offset":152,"end_offset":157}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65159,"text":"So this is also a solution to the differential equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65160,"text":"And then the next property I want to show you and this is all going someplace, don't worry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65161,"text":"The next question I want to ask you is, OK, we know that <EXPRESSION> is a solution to the differential equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65162,"text":"What if I were to also tell you that <EXPRESSION> is also a solution?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65163,"text":"So my question to you is, is <EXPRESSION> a solution?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65166,"text":"So we'll have <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> derivative of this thing.","entities":[{"id":85341,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":32},{"id":85342,"label":"method","start_offset":50,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65167,"text":"Well, that's straightforward enough.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65168,"text":"That's just <EXPRESSION> the <EXPRESSION> derivative of this thing <EXPRESSION> times this function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85343,"label":"method","start_offset":42,"end_offset":52},{"id":85344,"label":"command","start_offset":80,"end_offset":85}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65169,"text":"And now what can we do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65170,"text":"Let's distribute all of these constants.","entities":[{"id":85345,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65172,"text":"And now we can rearrange them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65176,"text":"So we've shown that this whole expression = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65178,"text":"So in general, if we show that <EXPRESSION> is a solution and <EXPRESSION> is a solution, you can add them.","entities":[{"id":85354,"label":"command","start_offset":98,"end_offset":101}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65179,"text":"And we showed before that any constant times them is also a solution.","entities":[{"id":85355,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65181,"text":"And maybe the constant in <EXPRESSION> of the cases is <EXPRESSION> or something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65182,"text":"I don't know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65183,"text":"But anyway, these are useful properties to maybe internalize for <EXPRESSION> order homogeneous linear differential equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65184,"text":"And in the next video, we're actually going to apply these properties to figure out the solutions for these.","entities":[{"id":85356,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65185,"text":"And you'll see that they're actually straightforward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65187,"text":"This is much, much easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65188,"text":"I'll see you in the next video.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65189,"text":"Today, I'm going to continue the idea of setting up integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65190,"text":"And what we'll deal with is volumes by slices.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65191,"text":"By slicing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65192,"text":"And it's lucky that this is after lunch.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65193,"text":"Maybe it's after breakfast for some of you, because there's the typical way of introducing this subject is with a food analogy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65194,"text":"There's a lot of ways of slicing up food.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65195,"text":"And we'll give a few more examples than just this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65197,"text":"So here's our loaf of bread, and I hope that looks a little bit like a loaf of bread.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65198,"text":"It's supposed to be sitting on the kitchen counter ready to be eaten.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65199,"text":"And in order to figure out how much bread there is there, <EXPRESSION> way of doing it is to cut it into slices.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65200,"text":"Now, you probably know that bread is often sliced like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65201,"text":"There are even machines to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65202,"text":"And with this setup here, I'll draw the slice with a little bit of a more colorful decoration.","entities":[{"id":85359,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65203,"text":"So here's our red slice of bread.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65204,"text":"It's coming around like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65205,"text":"And it comes back down behind.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65206,"text":"So here's our bread slice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65207,"text":"And what I'd like to figure out is its volume.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65210,"text":"And the only other dimension that I'm going to give, because this is a very qualitative analysis for now, is what I'll call the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65211,"text":"And that's the area on the face of the slice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65213,"text":"And in the limit, that's going to be something like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65214,"text":"And maybe the areas of the slices vary.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65215,"text":"There might be a little hole in the middle of the bread somewhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65217,"text":"So it might change as <EXPRESSION> changes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65218,"text":"And the whole volume you get by adding up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65222,"text":"And that would look like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65223,"text":"Alright, so that's just a superficial and intuitive way of looking at it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65225,"text":"It's already on your problem set, you had an example of a slice of some region.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65226,"text":"But we're only going to talk systematically about something called solids of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65227,"text":"The idea here is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65229,"text":"And now I'm going to revolve it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65231,"text":"In this case, I'm going to revolve it around the x-axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65233,"text":"If I can draw it a little bit.","entities":[{"id":85365,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65234,"text":"It's maybe a football.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65236,"text":"If you had made this copy underneath, it still would have been the same region.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65237,"text":"So we only pay attention to what's above the axis here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65238,"text":"So that's the basic idea.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65239,"text":"Now, I'm going to apply the method of slices to figure out the volume of such regions and give you a general formula.","entities":[{"id":85366,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65240,"text":"And then apply it in a specific case.","entities":[{"id":85367,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65244,"text":"They're very hard to deal with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65245,"text":"And it's hard to visualize with them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65247,"text":"So we're only going to deal with this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65256,"text":"So it starts out being more or less like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65257,"text":"But then we're going to sweep it around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65260,"text":"Swing around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65261,"text":"And that traces out something over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65262,"text":"Which I'm going to draw this way.","entities":[{"id":85369,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65263,"text":"It traces out a disk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65264,"text":"So it's hard for me to draw, and I'm not going to try too hard.","entities":[{"id":85370,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65265,"text":"Maybe I drew it more like a wheel, looking like a wheel.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65266,"text":"But anyway, it's this little flat disk here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65267,"text":"And so the method that I'm describing for figuring out the volume is called the method of disks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65268,"text":"This is going to be our <EXPRESSION> method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65269,"text":"Now I'm going to apply the reasoning that I have up on the previous blackboard here.","entities":[{"id":85371,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65270,"text":"Namely, I need to get the volume of this chunk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65271,"text":"And the way I'm going to get the volume of this chunk is by figuring out its thickness and its area, its cross-sectional area.","entities":[{"id":85373,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65272,"text":"And that's not too difficult to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65273,"text":"If this height, so this height is what we usually call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65274,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is usually a <EXPRESSION>, it's varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65275,"text":"And this particular distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65276,"text":"Then the area of the face is easy to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65277,"text":"Because it's a circle, or a disk if you like, with this radius.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65278,"text":"So its area is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65279,"text":"So that's, if you like, <EXPRESSION> of the dimensions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65280,"text":"And then the thickness is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65281,"text":"So the incremental volume is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65282,"text":"So this is the method of disks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65283,"text":"And this is the integrand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65285,"text":"And there are more peculiar things about this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65287,"text":"Which is that I'm integrating with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65288,"text":"And I haven't yet told you what <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65289,"text":"Well, that will depend on what <EQUATION> I use.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65291,"text":"If we're actually going to calculate something, we're going to have to figure that out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65294,"text":"So let's deal with an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65295,"text":"And we'll switch over from a football to a soccer ball.","entities":[{"id":85377,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65296,"text":"I'm going to take a circle, and we'll say it has radius <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85379,"label":"command","start_offset":38,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65297,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65298,"text":"And I'm putting it in this particular spot for a reason.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65299,"text":"You can do this in lots of different ways, but I'm picking this <EXPRESSION> to make a certain exercise on your homework easier for you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65300,"text":"Because I'm doing half of it for you right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65301,"text":"Appreciate it, yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65302,"text":"I'm sure especially today it's appreciated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65303,"text":"So again, the formula has to do with keeping track of these slices here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65304,"text":"And we're sweeping things around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65306,"text":"That's what our goal is, to figure out what the volume of the ball of radius <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65309,"text":"So the setup is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65310,"text":"It's always the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65311,"text":"Here's our formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65312,"text":"And we need to figure out what's going on with that formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65314,"text":"And in order to do that, what we're going to do is just write down the equation for the circle.","entities":[{"id":85382,"label":"command","start_offset":56,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65315,"text":"This is the circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65319,"text":"Take a square root, that's nice.","entities":[{"id":85383,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":4},{"id":85384,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65320,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65321,"text":"The <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.","entities":[{"id":85385,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65322,"text":"These <EXPRESSION> terms cancel.","entities":[{"id":85386,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65323,"text":"And so the formula here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65324,"text":"Alright now, that is what's known as the integrand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65325,"text":"Well, except for this factor of <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65326,"text":"And so the answer for the volume is going to be the integral of <EXPRESSION> times this integrand, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85387,"label":"method","start_offset":52,"end_offset":60},{"id":85388,"label":"command","start_offset":77,"end_offset":82}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65327,"text":"And that's just the same thing as this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65328,"text":"But now there's also the issue of the limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65329,"text":"Which is a completely separate problem, which we also have to solve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65330,"text":"The range of <EXPRESSION> is, from this leftmost point to the rightmost point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65331,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> varies, starts at <EXPRESSION>, and it goes all the way up to what, what's the top value here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65333,"text":"And so now I have a completely specified integral.","entities":[{"id":85389,"label":"method","start_offset":41,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65334,"text":"Again, and this was the theme last time, the whole goal is to get ourselves to a complete formula for something with an integrand and limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65335,"text":"And then we'll be able to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65336,"text":"Now, we have clear sailing to the end of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65337,"text":"So let's just finish it off.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65339,"text":"That's the thing whose derivative is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85391,"label":"method","start_offset":23,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65341,"text":"And that = <EXPRESSION> times, let's see.","entities":[{"id":85392,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65342,"text":"<EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65343,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65344,"text":"And so all told, that is, let's see, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65345,"text":"Which is maybe a familiar formula, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65346,"text":"So it worked, we got it right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65347,"text":"Let me just point out a couple of other things about this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65348,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is that from this point of view, we've actually accomplished more then just finding the volume of the ball.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65349,"text":"We've also found the volume of a bunch of intermediate regions, which I can draw schematically this way.","entities":[{"id":85394,"label":"command","start_offset":76,"end_offset":80}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65353,"text":"That's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65354,"text":"So we've got something which is actually a lot more information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65355,"text":"For instance, if you plug in <EQUATION>, not surprisingly, and this is a good idea to do because it checks that we've actually got a correct formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65356,"text":"So if you like you can call this a double-check.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65357,"text":"If you check <EXPRESSION>, this should be the volume of a half-ball.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65358,"text":"That's halfway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65359,"text":"If I go over here and I only go up to <EXPRESSION>, that's exactly half of the ball.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65360,"text":"That had better be half, so let's just see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65361,"text":"<EXPRESSION> in this case is <EXPRESSION>, and then I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65362,"text":"And that turns out to be <EXPRESSION> times a total of <EXPRESSION>, which is indeed half.","entities":[{"id":85395,"label":"command","start_offset":38,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65363,"text":"Now, on your problem set, what you're going to want to look at is this full formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65364,"text":"Of this chunk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65365,"text":"And what it's going to be good for is a real-life problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65366,"text":"That is, a problem that really came up over the summer, and this fall, at a couple of universities near here, where people were trying to figure out a phenomenon which is well-known.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65367,"text":"Namely, if you have a bunch of particles in a fluid, and maybe the size of these things is <EXPRESSION> micron.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65369,"text":"And then you have a bunch of other little particles, which are a lot smaller.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65371,"text":"Then what happens is that the particles, the big particles, like to hug each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65372,"text":"They like to clump together, they're very nice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65373,"text":"Friendly characters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65374,"text":"So what's the explanation for this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65375,"text":"The explanation is that actually they are not quite as friendly as they might seem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65376,"text":"What's really happening is that the little guys are shoving them around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65377,"text":"And pushing them together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65378,"text":"And they have sharp elbows, the little ones and they're pushing them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65379,"text":"Don't like them to be around and they're pushing them together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65380,"text":"But there's actually another possibility.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65381,"text":"Which is that they also will stick to the sides of the container.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65383,"text":"And if you want to get a quantitative handle on how much of this happens, it has to do with how much space these things take up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65384,"text":"And so the issue is some kind of overlap between a band around <EXPRESSION> sphere and a band around the other sphere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65385,"text":"And this overlap region is what you have to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65386,"text":"You have to calculate what's in here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65387,"text":"And you can do that using this formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65388,"text":"It's not even difficult.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65390,"text":"And then you're on your way to figuring out this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65391,"text":"And the question is, which do they prefer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65392,"text":"Do they prefer to touch each other, or do they prefer to touch the wall.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65393,"text":"Do they all cluster to the wall.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65394,"text":"So you can actually see this in solutions, what they do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65396,"text":"So that's a real, live problem, which really comes up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65397,"text":"Came up just this year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65398,"text":"And frequently comes up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65401,"text":"For solids of revolution, which is called the method of disks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65402,"text":"And now I need to tell you about the other standard method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65403,"text":"Which is called the method of shells.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65406,"text":"This is supposed to be a witches' cauldron.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65407,"text":"Whoops, witch, witches, well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65409,"text":"So here's this shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65410,"text":"And we're going to figure out how much liquid is in here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65411,"text":"I'm going to plot this.","entities":[{"id":85399,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65412,"text":"Maybe I'll put this down just a bit lower here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65413,"text":"And I'm going to make it a parabola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65414,"text":"This is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65415,"text":"And I'm going to make the top height be <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65416,"text":"So here's my situation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65417,"text":"And I want to figure out how much liquid is in here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65418,"text":"Now, the reason why I presented the problem in this form, of course, is really to get you used to these things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65421,"text":"And that's what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65422,"text":"If you spin the parabola around, you get this kind of shape, this kind of solid shape here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65423,"text":"Now, I'm going to use the same kind of slicing that I did before.","entities":[{"id":85402,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65424,"text":"But it's going to look totally different.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65425,"text":"Namely, I'll draw it in red again.","entities":[{"id":85403,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65427,"text":"And now I want to imagine what happens if it gets revolved around the y-axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65428,"text":"This time it's not a disk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65429,"text":"Actually, if I revolve this around the other way, it would have had a hole in it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65430,"text":"Which is also possible to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65431,"text":"That's practically the same as the method of disks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65432,"text":"You'll maybe discuss that in recitation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65433,"text":"Anyway, we're going to revolve it around this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65434,"text":"So again, I need to sweep it around, swing it around like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65435,"text":"And I'll draw the shape.","entities":[{"id":85405,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65436,"text":"It's going to sweep around in a circle and maybe it'll have a little bit of thickness to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65437,"text":"And this is the thing that people call a shell.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65438,"text":"This is the so-called shell of the method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65439,"text":"I would maybe call it a cylinder, and another way of thinking about it is that you can maybe wrap up a piece of paper.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65440,"text":"Like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65441,"text":"There it is, there's a cylinder you can see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65442,"text":"Very thin, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65443,"text":"Very thin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65444,"text":"Now, the reason why I used the piece of paper as an example of this is that I'm going to have to figure out the volume of this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65445,"text":"Its thickness, as usual, = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65446,"text":"Its height is what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65450,"text":"Now, again this is an incredibly risky thing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65453,"text":"And in disguise, when I call this <EXPRESSION>, I mean <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65454,"text":"In other words, the interesting curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65455,"text":"I don't mean <EQUATION>, which is the other part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65456,"text":"In general, you might think of it as being = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65457,"text":"So there are, of course, <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>'s involved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65458,"text":"In disguise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65460,"text":"Now, the last bit that I have to do, I claim, in order to figure this out, is the circumference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65461,"text":"And the reason for that is that if I think of this thing as like this tube, or piece of paper here, in order to figure out how much stuff there is here, all I have to do is unfold it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65462,"text":"Its size, the whole quantity of paper here is the same whether it's rolled up like this or whether it's stretched out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65463,"text":"So if I unwrap it, it looks like what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65464,"text":"Well, it looks like kind of a slab?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65465,"text":"Right, it looks like just a slab like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65466,"text":"And again, the thickness is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65467,"text":"The height is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65468,"text":"And now we can see that the length here is all the way around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65469,"text":"It's the circumference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65470,"text":"So this is going to be the circumference when I unwrap it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65471,"text":"And in order to figure out the circumference, I need to figure out the radius.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65472,"text":"So the radius is, on this diagram, is right over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65473,"text":"This is the radius.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65474,"text":"And that distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65475,"text":"So this length here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65476,"text":"And so this circumference is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65477,"text":"And this height is still ay.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65478,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, sorry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65479,"text":"And the thickness is still <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65480,"text":"So in total, we're just going to multiply these numbers together to get the total volume.","entities":[{"id":85409,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65481,"text":"We have, in other words, <EXPRESSION> = the product of the <EXPRESSION> dimension dimension, the <EXPRESSION> dimension, and the <EXPRESSION> dimension.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65482,"text":"Incidentally, dimensional analysis is very useful and important in these problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65483,"text":"You can see that there are <EXPRESSION> lengths being multiplied together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65485,"text":"Something cubic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65486,"text":"And we will be coming back to that, because it's a quite subtle issue sometimes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65487,"text":"So here's the formula, and let's simplify it a little bit.","entities":[{"id":85412,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65489,"text":"And then I rewrite that as <EXPRESSION> (<EXPRESSION>, whoops, <EXPRESSION>) <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85413,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65490,"text":"Better not get that wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65491,"text":"And now the last little bit here, that I had better be careful about in order to figure out what the total volume is, is the limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65492,"text":"So the volume is going to be the integral of this quantity <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85415,"label":"method","start_offset":33,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65493,"text":"And now I have to pay attention to what the limits are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65494,"text":"Now, here you have to be careful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65496,"text":"I went to it immediately, but that's the whole point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65497,"text":"Is that everything gets read off from this diagram here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65499,"text":"So we only have to count what's to the right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65500,"text":"We don't have to count anything over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65501,"text":"Because it's taken care of when we sweep around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65503,"text":"That's where we start.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65504,"text":"And where we end is the farthest, rightmost spot for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65505,"text":"Which is down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65506,"text":"You've got to watch out about where that is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65507,"text":"In the <EXPRESSION> variable, it's up at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65508,"text":"But in the <EXPRESSION> variable, we can see that it's what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65509,"text":"It's the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65510,"text":"So these limits, this is where you're going to focus all your attention on the integrand and getting it just right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65511,"text":"And then you're going to lose your steam and not pay attention to the limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65512,"text":"They're equally important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65513,"text":"You've no hope of getting the right answer without getting the limits right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65514,"text":"So this is the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85423,"label":"method","start_offset":15,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65515,"text":"Again, that's just because <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> implies <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65516,"text":"That's that upper limit there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65517,"text":"And now, we're ready to carry out this, to evaluate this integral.","entities":[{"id":85424,"label":"method","start_offset":57,"end_offset":65}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65518,"text":"So we get <EXPRESSION> sorry, we get <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85425,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":9},{"id":85426,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65519,"text":"Maybe I'll leave the <EXPRESSION>'s in there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65521,"text":"And finally, let's see, what is that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65522,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65523,"text":"Which is a total of <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65525,"text":"Yes, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65526,"text":"Right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65527,"text":"So the question is, why did I integrate only from the middle to this end, instead of all the way from over here, <EXPRESSION>, all the way to the plus end.","entities":[{"id":85429,"label":"command","start_offset":30,"end_offset":39},{"id":85430,"label":"command","start_offset":146,"end_offset":150}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65528,"text":"And the reason is that you have to look at what's happening with the rotation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65531,"text":"So if I counted the stuff from <EXPRESSION>, I would be doing it twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65532,"text":"I would be doubling what I need.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65541,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65564,"text":"So the answer to both of those questions is the same and it's this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65565,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65566,"text":"So that if you rotated them both around and you only wanted to cover things once, you would rotate halfway around.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65568,"text":"That's true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65569,"text":"But you can rotate around as many times as you want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65570,"text":"You're still covering the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65571,"text":"Over and over and over and over again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65572,"text":"So let's go on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65573,"text":"I have a very subtle point that I need to discuss with you in order to go on to the next application.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65575,"text":"So let's continue here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65577,"text":"There's something a little fishy in this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65578,"text":"And it can be summarized in the character of the answer, which is just a little bit not clear.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65580,"text":"And we know that a is in units and we should've gotten cubic units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65581,"text":"So there's something a little bit tricky about this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65582,"text":"And so I want to illustrate the paradox right now.","entities":[{"id":85450,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65583,"text":"So, suppose that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65584,"text":"And suppose the units are centimeters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65585,"text":"Then the formula for the volume is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65587,"text":"Despite the fact that you kind of want to square the centimeters.","entities":[{"id":85453,"label":"method","start_offset":42,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65588,"text":"But that's not what this problem says.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65589,"text":"OK, so this is the situation that we've got.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65591,"text":"And those are otherwise known as liters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65592,"text":"So this is approximately <EXPRESSION> liters, which is about <EXPRESSION> liters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65593,"text":"And so that's how much was in the cauldron under this choice of units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65594,"text":"Now, I'm going to make another choice of units now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65618,"text":"The answer to this question is that both answers are correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65619,"text":"This is correct reasoning in both cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65620,"text":"What's the matter is that you have to interpret the equation <EQUATION> in <EXPRESSION> different ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65621,"text":"<EXPRESSION> ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65622,"text":"So let me explain what they are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65630,"text":"So the top of the cauldron, if you like, this distance here is <EXPRESSION> centimeters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65631,"text":"This is actually very badly drawn to scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65632,"text":"It's actually very, very, deep, this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65633,"text":"It's a rather skinny, deep <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65634,"text":"So this is very much not to scale, this picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65635,"text":"The other picture, the other picture is interpreting <EQUATION> in meters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65636,"text":"And that's more like what I had in mind, actually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65637,"text":"I had in mind this big vat here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65638,"text":"And this distance here is <EXPRESSION> meter, and then the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65640,"text":"And the top is <EXPRESSION> meters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65641,"text":"Now, it's not that crazy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65642,"text":"And in fact it's easy to check that, it's pretty reasonable in terms of scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65643,"text":"That this thing has <EXPRESSION> liters in it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65644,"text":"And this guy has <EXPRESSION> liters in it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65645,"text":"So you actually have to know what your symbols mean when you're dealing with these kinds of applied problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65646,"text":"And if you're ever really going to do some real consequences, you have to know what the units mean.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65647,"text":"And the problem with the equation <EQUATION> is that it's the <EXPRESSION> that violated scaling rules.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65648,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65649,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65650,"text":"No.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65651,"text":"OK, so the question is whether the formula <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65652,"text":"This is the correct answer to the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65653,"text":"But it is not consistent in units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65655,"text":"And they're all inconsistent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65656,"text":"In other words, this formula violates scaling.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65657,"text":"If you study each step correctly, you will discover that these are the consistent and correct statements, what I'm writing on the blackboard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65658,"text":"And this makes sense in a unit-less sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65661,"text":"And it's a mistake to think of this as being 1 meter and cubing the meters.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65662,"text":"That will be an error that will cause you problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65664,"text":"So I encourage you to study this on your own.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65665,"text":"So now I'm going to introduce the next problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65666,"text":"We'll have to solve it next time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":65667,"text":"But the reason why I spent all the time on units is that otherwise it would be impossible for you to believe me when I do this next calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66261,"text":"Well, pretend that immediately after I talked about that, I talked about this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66262,"text":"What is the solution?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66263,"text":"Well, the solution, maybe you took it for granted, is a pair of functions, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> if when you plug it in it satisfies the equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66269,"text":"What does it represent?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66270,"text":"A curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66271,"text":"And what will be the title of the chapter of the calculus book in which that is discussed?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66272,"text":"Parametric equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66273,"text":"This is a parameterized curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66274,"text":"So we know what the solution looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66275,"text":"Our solution is a parameterized curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66276,"text":"And what does a parameterized curve look like?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66277,"text":"Well, it travels, and in a certain direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66278,"text":"Okay.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66279,"text":"That's enough.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66280,"text":"Why do I have several of those curves?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66281,"text":"Well, because I have several solutions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66282,"text":"In fact, given any initial starting point, there is a solution that goes through it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66283,"text":"I will put in possible starting points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66284,"text":"And you can do this on the computer screen with a little program you will have, <EXPRESSION> of the visuals you'll have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66285,"text":"It's being made right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66286,"text":"You put down starter point, put down a click, and then it just draws the curve passing through that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66287,"text":"Didn't we do this early in the term?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66288,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66289,"text":"But there is a difference now which I will explain.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66290,"text":"These are various possible starting points at time <EXPRESSION> for this solution, and then you see what happens to it afterwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66291,"text":"In fact, through every point in the plane will pass a solution curve, parameterized curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66295,"text":"What does this mean by itself?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66296,"text":"If this is the curve, the parameterized motion, then this represents its velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66297,"text":"It is the velocity of the solution at time <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66298,"text":"If I think of the solution as being a parameterized motion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66299,"text":"All I have drawn here is the trace, the path of the motion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66300,"text":"This hasn't indicated how fast it was going.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66302,"text":"That is a velocity, and that velocity changes from point to point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66303,"text":"It changes direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66304,"text":"Well, we know its direction at each point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66305,"text":"That's tangent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66306,"text":"What I cannot tell is the speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66307,"text":"From this picture, I cannot tell what the speed was.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66308,"text":"Too bad.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66309,"text":"Now, what is then the meaning of the system?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66310,"text":"What the system does, it prescribes at each point the velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66313,"text":"So at each point there is a certain vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66314,"text":"The vector is always tangent to the solution curve through there, but I cannot predict from just this picture what its length will be because at some points, it might be going slow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66315,"text":"The solution might be going slowly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66316,"text":"In other words, the plane is filled up with these guys.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66317,"text":"Stop me.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66318,"text":"Not enough here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66319,"text":"So on and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66321,"text":"A field of velocity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66322,"text":"The plane covered with velocity vectors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66323,"text":"And a solution is a parameterized curve with the right velocity everywhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66350,"text":"So, those are the equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66352,"text":"Well, for a lot of reasons.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66353,"text":"But, maybe we can list them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66354,"text":"You, for example, could be changing units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66355,"text":"That's a common reason in physics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66356,"text":"Changing the units that he used, you would have to make a change of coordinates of this form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66357,"text":"Perhaps the even more important reason is to, sometimes it's used to make the variables dimensionless.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66358,"text":"In other words, so that the variables become pure numbers, with no units attached to them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66360,"text":"Dimensionless, i.e. no units, without any units attached.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
