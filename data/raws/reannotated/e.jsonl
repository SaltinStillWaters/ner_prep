{"id":227839,"text":"You can see that it's tilting down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227840,"text":"So it's okay.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227841,"text":"Now on the bottom side, it's going to be tilting up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227842,"text":"And similarly what's happening up here is that both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, and this <EXPRESSION> and this <EXPRESSION> are positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227844,"text":"On the other hand, on the bottom side, is still positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227847,"text":"So it matches perfectly in every category.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227848,"text":"This complicated, however, and it's easier just to keep track of one branch at a time, even in advanced math.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227850,"text":"Other questions?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227851,"text":"Okay, so now I want to give you a slightly more complicated example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
