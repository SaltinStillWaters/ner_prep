{"id":221739,"text":"So, let's look at the situation when they both = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221740,"text":"So, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221741,"text":"Well, in that case, <EXPRESSION> should still be = <EXPRESSION> because you have negative <EXPRESSION> over <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221742,"text":"Do we see that over here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221743,"text":"So, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221744,"text":"Our derivative here looks negative.","entities":[{"id":87372,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221745,"text":"It looks like negative <EXPRESSION>, which is consistent with this yellow differential equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221746,"text":"The slope here is definitely not a positive <EXPRESSION>, so we could rule this <EXPRESSION> out as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221747,"text":"And so we should feel pretty confident that this is the differential equation being described.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221748,"text":"And now that we've done it, we can actually think about well, okay, what are the solutions for this differential equation going to look like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221749,"text":"Well, it depends where they start or what points they contain.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221750,"text":"If you have a solution that contains that point, it looks like it might do something like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221751,"text":"If you had a solution that contained this point, it might do something like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221752,"text":"And, of course, it keeps going.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221753,"text":"It looks like it would asymptote towards <EQUATION>, this downward sloping.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221754,"text":"This essentially is the line <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221755,"text":"Actually, no that is not the line <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221756,"text":"This is the line <EQUATION>, so that's this line right over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221757,"text":"And it looks like if the solution contained, say, this point right over here, that would actually be a solution to the differential equation <EQUATION> and you can verify that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221758,"text":"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221759,"text":"Right now, we're finishing up with the <EXPRESSION> unit, and I'd like to continue in this lecture, lecture <EXPRESSION>, with some final remarks about exponents.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221760,"text":"So what I'd like to do is just review something that I did quickly last time, and make a few philosophical remarks about it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221761,"text":"I think that the steps involved were maybe a little tricky, and so I'd like to go through it <EXPRESSION> more time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221762,"text":"And what we showed was that the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221763,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> thing that I'd like to do is just explain the proof a little bit more clearly than I did last time with fewer symbols, or at least with this abbreviation of the symbol here, to show you what we actually did.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221764,"text":"So I'll just remind you of what we did last time, and the <EXPRESSION> observation was to check, rather than the limit of this function, but to take the log <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87377,"label":"command","start_offset":144,"end_offset":148}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221765,"text":"And this is typically what's done when you have an exponential, when you have an exponent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221766,"text":"And what we found was that the limit here was <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221767,"text":"So last time, this is what we did.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221768,"text":"And I just wanted to be careful and show you exactly what the next step is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221769,"text":"If you exponentiate this fact; you take <EXPRESSION> to this power, that's going to tend to <EXPRESSION>, which is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221770,"text":"And then, we just observe that this is the same as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221771,"text":"So the basic ingredient here is that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221772,"text":"That's because the log function is the inverse of the exponential function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221773,"text":"Yes, question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221774,"text":"Who said it was?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221775,"text":"We don't really know yet from this expression, in fact we did some cleverness with limits and derivatives, to figure out this limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221776,"text":"It was a very subtle thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221777,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221779,"text":"Because I want to have room for the next comment that I want to make on this little blackboard here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221780,"text":"What we just derived was this property here, but I made a claim yesterday, and I just want to emphasize it again so that we realized what it is that we're doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221781,"text":"I looked at this backwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221782,"text":"<EXPRESSION> way you can think of this is we're evaluating this limit and getting an answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221783,"text":"But all equalities can be read both directions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221784,"text":"And we can write it the other way: <EQUATION>, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of this expression here.","entities":[{"id":87380,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221785,"text":"So that's just the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221786,"text":"And if we read it backwards, what we're saying is that this limit is a formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221787,"text":"So this is very typical of mathematics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221788,"text":"You want to always reverse your perspective all the time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221789,"text":"Equations work both ways, and in this case, we have <EXPRESSION> different things here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221791,"text":"And then it turns out to be = this limit, which we can calculate numerically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221792,"text":"If you do this on your calculators, you, of course, will have a way of programming in this number and evaluating it for each <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221793,"text":"And you'll have another button available to evaluate this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221794,"text":"So another way of saying it is it that there's a relationship between these <EXPRESSION> things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221795,"text":"And all of calculus is a matter of getting these relationships.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221796,"text":"So we can look at these things in several different ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221797,"text":"And indeed, that's what we're going to be doing at least at the end of today in talking about derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221798,"text":"A lot of times when we talk about derivatives, we're trying to look at them from several perspectives at once.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221799,"text":"Okay, so I have to keep on going with exponents, because I have <EXPRESSION> loose end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":221802,"text":"We actually didn't do this - well we did it for rational numbers <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221803,"text":"So this is the formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221804,"text":"But now we're going to check this for all real numbers, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":221805,"text":"So including all the irrational ones as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":221880,"text":"So this is a review of Unit <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222124,"text":"So I will describe that now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222125,"text":"So let me also emphasize the following thing: I want to read this backwards now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222126,"text":"This is the theme from the very beginning of this lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222127,"text":"Namely, if you're given the function <EXPRESSION>, you can figure out its derivative by this formula here.","entities":[{"id":87552,"label":"method","start_offset":74,"end_offset":84}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222130,"text":"Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION> so it's clearer to you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222131,"text":"Maybe I'll call it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222132,"text":"Suppose you look at this limit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222133,"text":"Well, I claim that you should recognize that is the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> of the function <EQUATION>, which of course we know to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87555,"label":"method","start_offset":52,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222134,"text":"So this is reading this formula in reverse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222135,"text":"It's recognizing that <EXPRESSION> of these limits - let me rewrite this again here - <EXPRESSION> of these so-called difference quotient limits is a derivative.","entities":[{"id":87556,"label":"command","start_offset":60,"end_offset":67},{"id":87557,"label":"method","start_offset":118,"end_offset":128},{"id":87558,"label":"method","start_offset":150,"end_offset":160}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222137,"text":"And lastly, there's <EXPRESSION> other type of thing which I think you should know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222138,"text":"These are the ones you do with difference quotients.","entities":[{"id":87560,"label":"method","start_offset":31,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222139,"text":"There are also other formulas that you want to be able to derive.","entities":[{"id":87561,"label":"command","start_offset":58,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222141,"text":"In other words, the basic idea is to take whatever equation you've got and simplify it as much as possible, without insisting that you solve for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87564,"label":"command","start_offset":37,"end_offset":41},{"id":87565,"label":"command","start_offset":75,"end_offset":83}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222142,"text":"That's not necessarily the most appropriate way to get the rate of change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222143,"text":"The much simpler formula is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222144,"text":"And that <EXPRESSION> is easier to differentiate implicitly.","entities":[{"id":87567,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222145,"text":"So I should say, do this kind of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222146,"text":"So that's, if you like, a typical derivation that you might see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222147,"text":"And then there's <EXPRESSION> last type of problem that you'll face, and it's the other thing that I claim we discussed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222148,"text":"And it goes all the way back to the <EXPRESSION> lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222149,"text":"So the last thing that we'll be talking about is tangent lines.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222150,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222151,"text":"The geometric point of view of a derivative.","entities":[{"id":87569,"label":"method","start_offset":33,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222152,"text":"And we'll be doing more of this in next the unit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222153,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> of all, you'll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222154,"text":"That's often fairly straightforward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222155,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing is to graph <EXPRESSION>, the derivative of a function.","entities":[{"id":87570,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":38},{"id":87571,"label":"method","start_offset":57,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222156,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing, which I'm going to throw in here, because I regard it in a sort of geometric vein, although it's got an analytical aspect to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222157,"text":"So this is a picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222158,"text":"This is a computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222159,"text":"And if you combine the <EXPRESSION> together, you get something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222160,"text":"And so this is to recognize differentiable functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222161,"text":"Alright, so how do you do this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222162,"text":"Well, we really only have <EXPRESSION> way of doing it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222163,"text":"We're going to check the left and right tangents.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222164,"text":"They must be =.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222165,"text":"So again, this is a property that you should be familiar with from some of your exercises.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222166,"text":"And the idea is simply, that if the tangent line exists, it's the same from the right and from the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222167,"text":"Okay, now I'm going to just do <EXPRESSION> example here from this sort of qualitative sketching skill to give you an example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222168,"text":"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a graph of a function like this.","entities":[{"id":87577,"label":"command","start_offset":41,"end_offset":45},{"id":87578,"label":"command","start_offset":48,"end_offset":53}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222170,"text":"So this is the function <EQUATION>, and here I'm going to draw the graph of the function <EQUATION> right underneath it.","entities":[{"id":87582,"label":"command","start_offset":58,"end_offset":62},{"id":87583,"label":"command","start_offset":67,"end_offset":72}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222171,"text":"So now, let's think about what it's supposed to look like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222172,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> step that you need to make in order to do this, is to draw a few tangent lines.","entities":[{"id":87585,"label":"command","start_offset":75,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222173,"text":"I'm just going to draw <EXPRESSION> down here.","entities":[{"id":87586,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222175,"text":"Now, the tangent lines here - notice that the slope of these tangent lines are all positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222176,"text":"So everything I draw down here is going to be above the <EXPRESSION>-axis.","entities":[{"id":87588,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222177,"text":"Furthermore, as I go further to the left, they get steeper and steeper.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222178,"text":"So they're getting higher and higher.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222179,"text":"So the function is coming down like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222180,"text":"It starts up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222182,"text":"So that's this function here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222183,"text":"As we get farther out, it's getting flatter and flatter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222184,"text":"So it's leveling off, but above the axis like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222185,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> of the things to emphasize is, you should not expect the derivative to look like the function.","entities":[{"id":87595,"label":"method","start_offset":73,"end_offset":83}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222186,"text":"It's totally different.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222187,"text":"It's keeping track at each point of its tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222188,"text":"On the other hand, you should get some kind of physical feel for it, and we'll be practicing this more in the next unit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222189,"text":"So let me give you an example of a function which does exactly this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222206,"text":"So I'm doing this super fast because we have <EXPRESSION> seconds left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222207,"text":"But this is the hard step right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222208,"text":"And it needs for you to know that <EQUATION> over Oh, bad bad bad, secant squared.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222209,"text":"I was ahead of myself so fast.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222210,"text":"So here's the identity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222211,"text":"So you need have known this in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222212,"text":"And that's the input into this equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222213,"text":"So now, what we have is that <EQUATION>, which is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222224,"text":"So, so far, we've seen things about vectors, equation of planes, motions in space, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222225,"text":"Basically we've done geometry in space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222226,"text":"But, calculus, really, is about studying functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222227,"text":"Now, we're going to actually move on to studying functions of several variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222228,"text":"So, this new unit, what we'll do over the next <EXPRESSION> weeks or so will be about functions of several variables and their derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222229,"text":"OK, so <EXPRESSION> of all, we should try to figure out how we are going to think about functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222230,"text":"So, remember, if you have a function of <EXPRESSION> variable, that means you have a quantity that depends on <EXPRESSION> parameter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222231,"text":"Maybe <EXPRESSION> depends on the variable <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222232,"text":"And, for example, a function that you all know is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222233,"text":"And, the way we would represent that is maybe just by plotting the graph of the function.","entities":[{"id":87616,"label":"command","start_offset":67,"end_offset":72}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222234,"text":"So, the graph of a function, we plot <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87617,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":13},{"id":87618,"label":"command","start_offset":32,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222235,"text":"And, the graph of a <EXPRESSION> function that looks like this.","entities":[{"id":87619,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222236,"text":"OK, so now, let's say that we had, actually, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[{"id":87620,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222237,"text":"So, that means that the value of <EXPRESSION> depends actually on <EXPRESSION> different parameters, say, if the variables are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, or they can have any names you want.","entities":[{"id":87621,"label":"command","start_offset":101,"end_offset":104}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222238,"text":"So, given values of the <EXPRESSION> parameters, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, the function will give us a number that we'll call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222239,"text":"That depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> according to some formula, OK, not very surprising so far.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222240,"text":"So, for example, I can give you the function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222241,"text":"And, of course, as with functions of <EXPRESSION> variable, we don't need things to be defined everywhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222242,"text":"Sometimes there is the domain of definition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222243,"text":"So, this <EXPRESSION> is defined all the time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222244,"text":"But, if I tell you, say, <EQUATION>, well, this is only defined if <EXPRESSION> is nonnegative.","entities":[{"id":87622,"label":"command","start_offset":20,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222245,"text":"If I tell you <EQUATION>, that's only defined if <EXPRESSION> is not <EXPRESSION>, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222246,"text":"Now, so these are mathematical examples given by explicit formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222247,"text":"And, of course, there's physical examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222248,"text":"For example, so examples coming from real life, so for example, you can look at the temperature at the certain point on the surface of the earth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222249,"text":"So, you use maybe longitude and latitude; that's <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222250,"text":"And then you have <EXPRESSION> = the temperature at that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222251,"text":"In fact, because temperature depends also may be on how high up you are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222252,"text":"It depends on elevation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222253,"text":"So, it's actually a function of maybe <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222254,"text":"And, it also depends on time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222255,"text":"So, in fact, maybe it's a function of <EXPRESSION> in <EXPRESSION> coordinates in space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222256,"text":"So, you see that real-world functions can depends on a lot of variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222257,"text":"So, our goal will be to understand how to deal with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222258,"text":"OK, so now you will see very soon, but actually it's already tricky enough to picture a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222259,"text":"So, we are going to focus on the case of functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222261,"text":"We cannot draw with the graph looks like anymore.","entities":[{"id":87625,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":14},{"id":87626,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222262,"text":"But, the tools are the same, the notion of partial derivatives, grade and vector, and so on, all the tools that we will develop work exactly the same way no matter how many variables you have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222263,"text":"So, I'll say, for simplicity we'll focus mostly on <EXPRESSION> or sometimes <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[{"id":87627,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222264,"text":"But, it works the same in any number of variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222265,"text":"OK, so the <EXPRESSION> question is how to visualize a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222266,"text":"So, the <EXPRESSION> thing we can do is try to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87628,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":51},{"id":87629,"label":"command","start_offset":56,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222267,"text":"So, maybe I should say <EXPRESSION> which is a function of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[{"id":87630,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222271,"text":"And, now that will become, actually, a surface in space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222272,"text":"And, <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222273,"text":"OK, and if we take all of these points together, they will give us some surface that sits in space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222274,"text":"Yes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222275,"text":"Oh, a function of <EXPRESSION> variables, shorthand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222277,"text":"OK, so, how do we do that concretely?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222278,"text":"Say that I give you a formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87637,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":3}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222279,"text":"How do we try to represent it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222280,"text":"So, let's do our <EXPRESSION> example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222281,"text":"Let's say I give you a function <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87638,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222282,"text":"OK, so it looks a little bit silly because it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222283,"text":"But, that's not the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222284,"text":"It's still a valid function of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222285,"text":"It just happens to be constant with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222286,"text":"So, to draw the graph we look at the surface in space defined by <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87639,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":11},{"id":87640,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222287,"text":"What kind of surface is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222288,"text":"It's a plane, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222289,"text":"And, if we want to draw it, <EQUATION> will look, well, let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.","entities":[{"id":87641,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222290,"text":"Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222291,"text":"Let's put <EXPRESSION> axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222292,"text":"If I look at what happens in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane in the plane of a blackboard, it will just look like a line that goes downward with slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222293,"text":"OK, so it will be this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222294,"text":"And, what happens if I change <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222295,"text":"Well, if I change <EXPRESSION>, nothing happens because <EXPRESSION> doesn't appear in this equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222296,"text":"So, in fact, if instead of setting <EQUATION> I set <EQUATION>, I'm in front of the blackboard, or <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> at the back.","entities":[{"id":87642,"label":"command","start_offset":48,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222297,"text":"Well, it still looks exactly the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222298,"text":"So, I have this plane that actually contains the <EXPRESSION> axis and slopes downwards with slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222299,"text":"It's kind of hard to draw.","entities":[{"id":87643,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222300,"text":"Now, you see immediately what the big problem with graphs will be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222301,"text":"But, these pictures are hard to read.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222302,"text":"But that's our <EXPRESSION> graph.","entities":[{"id":87644,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222303,"text":"OK, a question so far?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222304,"text":"OK, so let's say that we have a slightly more complicated function.","entities":[{"id":87645,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222305,"text":"How do we see it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222306,"text":"So, let's draw another example.","entities":[{"id":87646,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222307,"text":"Let's say I give you <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87647,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222308,"text":"So, we should try to picture what the surface <EQUATION> looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222309,"text":"So, how do we do that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222310,"text":"Well, maybe you are very fast and figured out what it looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222311,"text":"But, if not, then we need to work piece by piece.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222312,"text":"So, maybe it will help if we understand <EXPRESSION> what it does in the plane of the blackboard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222313,"text":"So, if we look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, that means we set <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87648,"label":"command","start_offset":76,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222314,"text":"And then, <EXPRESSION> becomes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222315,"text":"What is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222316,"text":"It's a parabola pointing downwards, and starting at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222317,"text":"So, we should draw maybe this downward parabola.","entities":[{"id":87649,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222318,"text":"It starts at <EXPRESSION> and it cuts the <EXPRESSION> axis at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222319,"text":"When <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, that gives us <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222320,"text":"So, we might have an idea of what it might look like, or maybe not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222321,"text":"Let's get more slices.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222322,"text":"Let's see what it does in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, this other vertical plane that's coming towards us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222323,"text":"So, in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, if we set <EQUATION>, we get <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87651,"label":"command","start_offset":51,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222324,"text":"It's, again, a parabola going downwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222325,"text":"OK, so I'm going to try to draw a parabola that goes downward, but now to the front and to the back.","entities":[{"id":87653,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222326,"text":"So, we are starting to have a slightly better idea but we still don't know whether the cross section of this thing might be round, square, something else.","entities":[{"id":87654,"label":"method","start_offset":131,"end_offset":137}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222327,"text":"So, it wants more confirmation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222328,"text":"We might want to also figure out where the surface intersects the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222329,"text":"So, we hit the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane when <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222330,"text":"That means <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>, that becomes <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222331,"text":"That is a circle of radius <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222332,"text":"That's the unit size.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222333,"text":"So, that means that here, we actually have the unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222334,"text":"And now, you should imagine that you have this thing that when you slice it by a vertical plane, looks like a downwards parabola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222335,"text":"And, it's actually a surface of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222336,"text":"You can rotate it around the <EXPRESSION> axis, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222337,"text":"Now, if you stare long enough at that equation, you'll actually see that, yes, we know that it had to be like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222338,"text":"But, see, so these are useful ways of trying to guess what the graph looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222339,"text":"Of course, the other way is to just ask your computer to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222340,"text":"And then, you know, you will get that kind of formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222341,"text":"OK, well, I can leave it on if you want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222342,"text":"No, because I plotted a different function that I will show you later.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222343,"text":"So, it goes this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222344,"text":"I mean, if you want, it's really going downward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222345,"text":"Yes, I agree that the sheet is upside down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222346,"text":"That's because I plotted something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222347,"text":"OK, so, in fact, so I plotted in my computer was actually <EXPRESSION> that looks like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222348,"text":"See, it's the same with a parabola going upwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222349,"text":"If you want to see more examples, I have various examples to show, well, here's the graph, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222350,"text":"See, so that <EXPRESSION> is kind of interesting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222351,"text":"It looks like a saddle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222352,"text":"If you look at it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then it's a parabola going up, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222353,"text":"And, that's what we see to the left and to the right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222354,"text":"But, if you put it in the <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plane, then that's a parabola going downwards, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222355,"text":"So, we have a parabola going downwards in <EXPRESSION> direction, upwards in the other <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222356,"text":"And together, they form this surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222357,"text":"And of course, you can plot much more complicated functions.","entities":[{"id":87660,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222358,"text":"So, this <EXPRESSION>, well, if you can read very small things, you can see the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222359,"text":"It doesn't matter, just to show you that you can put a formula into a computer: it will show you a picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222360,"text":"OK, so that's pretty good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222361,"text":"I mean, you can see that it can get a bit cluttered because maybe those features that are hidden behind, or maybe we have trouble seeing if we don't have a computer, that looks very readable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222362,"text":"But, this is kind of hard to visualize sometimes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222363,"text":"So, there is another way to plot the functions of <EXPRESSION> variables.","entities":[{"id":87662,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222364,"text":"And, let's call it the contour plot.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222367,"text":"So, what contour plot looks something like this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222368,"text":"So, it's an <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> plot.","entities":[{"id":87667,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222369,"text":"And, that, you have a bunch of curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222370,"text":"And, what the curves represent are the elevations on the graph.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222371,"text":"So, for example, this curve might correspond to all the points where <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222372,"text":"And, that curve might be all the points where <EQUATION> and <EQUATION> and so on, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222374,"text":"It's like a map telling you how high things are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222375,"text":"And, what you would want to do with the function, really, is be able to tell quickly what's the value at a given point?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222376,"text":"Well, let's say I want to look at that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222377,"text":"I know that <EXPRESSION> is somewhere between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222378,"text":"Actually, it's much faster to read than the graph.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222380,"text":"Here, I can just raise the value of <EXPRESSION> by comparing with the nearby lines.","entities":[{"id":87674,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222381,"text":"OK, so let me try to make that more precise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222382,"text":"So, it shows all the points where <EXPRESSION> = some fixed values, some fixed constants.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222383,"text":"And, these constants typically are chosen at regular intervals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222384,"text":"For example, here I chose <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and they could continue with <EXPRESSION> minus <EXPRESSION>, and so on.","entities":[{"id":87675,"label":"command","start_offset":110,"end_offset":115}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222385,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> way to think about it, how does this relate to the graph?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222386,"text":"Well, that's the same thing as cutting, I mean, we slice the graph by horizontal planes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222387,"text":"So, horizontal planes have equations of a form <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION> <EQUATION>, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222389,"text":"And, if I slice it by the plane <EQUATION>, then I will get the level curve, which is the point where <EQUATION>, and so, that's called a level curve of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222390,"text":"OK, and so we repeat the process with maybe <EQUATION>, and we get another level curve, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222392,"text":"OK, so each of these lines, imagine that this is like some mountain or something that you are hiking on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222393,"text":"Each of these lines tells you how you could move to stay at a constant height if you want to get to the other side of the mountain but without ever going up or down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222394,"text":"You would just walk along that path, and it will get you there without effort.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222395,"text":"So, in fact, if you have been talking about hiking on mountains, well, that's exactly what a topographical map is about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222396,"text":"So, I need to zoom a bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222511,"text":"Sorry, and I should also tell you what this means on the graph.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222512,"text":"So, if I plot the graph of a function, and to have my point, <EXPRESSION>, and here I have <EXPRESSION>, how do I see the derivative?","entities":[{"id":87730,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":13},{"id":87731,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23},{"id":87732,"label":"method","start_offset":122,"end_offset":132}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222538,"text":"I'm just changing <EXPRESSION> and looking at the rate of change with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222546,"text":"So, let's see what it means geometrically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222547,"text":"So, geometrically, my function can be represented by this graph, and I fix some point, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":222882,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION> way, that if I wanted to express the solution of this differential equation's integral, I could write it like that.","entities":[{"id":87924,"label":"method","start_offset":98,"end_offset":106},{"id":87925,"label":"command","start_offset":116,"end_offset":121}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222883,"text":"And it actually should be kind of obvious to you that this could go either way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222884,"text":"Because when it was a product up here, obviously order does not matter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222885,"text":"I could write this term <EXPRESSION>, or I could write that term <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87926,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":13},{"id":87927,"label":"command","start_offset":49,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222886,"text":"So regardless of which term is written <EXPRESSION>, the same principle would apply.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222887,"text":"And I'll formally prove it in a future video.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222888,"text":"So we could have also done it the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222889,"text":"We could have written this expression as <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, convoluted with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222890,"text":"And that would be = the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87929,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222891,"text":"So these are equivalent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222892,"text":"Either of these would be an acceptable answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222893,"text":"And normally on a test like this, the teacher won't expect you to actually evaluate these integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222895,"text":"So hopefully, this <EXPRESSION> example with the convolution to solve an inverse transform clarified things up a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222896,"text":"So, we're ready to begin Lecture <EXPRESSION>, and what I'm going to begin with is by finishing up some things from last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222897,"text":"We'll talk about approximations, and I want to fill in a number of comments and get you a little bit more oriented in the point of view that I'm trying to express about approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222898,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> of all, I want to remind you of the actual applied example that I wrote down last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222899,"text":"So that was this business here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222900,"text":"There was something from special relativity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222901,"text":"And the approximation that we used was the linear approximation, with a <EXPRESSION> power that comes out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222902,"text":"I want to reiterate why this is a useful way of thinking of things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222903,"text":"And why this is that this comes up in real life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222904,"text":"Why this is maybe more important than everything that I've taught you about technically so far.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222905,"text":"If you work that out, this is approximately the same as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222906,"text":"So what is this saying?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222908,"text":"So, physically, this makes sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222909,"text":"This is time divided by time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222910,"text":"And this is velocity squared divided by velocity squared.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222911,"text":"So, in each case, the units divide out.","entities":[{"id":87936,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222912,"text":"So this is a dimensionless quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222913,"text":"And this is a dimensionless quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222914,"text":"And the only point here that we're trying to make is just this notion of proportionality.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222915,"text":"So I want to write this down.","entities":[{"id":87937,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222916,"text":"Just, in summary.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222917,"text":"So the error fraction, if you like, which is sort of the number of significant digits that we have in our measurement, is proportional, in this case, to this quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222918,"text":"It happens to be proportional to this quantity here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222919,"text":"And the factor is, happens to be, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222920,"text":"So these proportionality factors are what we're looking for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222921,"text":"Their rates of change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222922,"text":"Their rates of change of something with respect to something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222923,"text":"Now, on your homework, you have something rather similar to this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222924,"text":"And the speed of the pitch is changing depending on how high the mound is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222925,"text":"And the point here is that that's approximately proportional to the change in the height of the mound.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222926,"text":"And what you're trying to figure out is what the constant of proportionality is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222927,"text":"That's what you're aiming for in this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222928,"text":"So there's a linear relationship, approximately, to all intents and purposes this is an equality.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222929,"text":"Because the lower order terms are unimportant for the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222930,"text":"Just as over here, this function is a little bit complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222931,"text":"This function is a little more simple.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222932,"text":"For the purposes of this problem, they are the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222933,"text":"Because the errors are negligible for the particular problem that we're working on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222934,"text":"So we might as well work with the simpler relationship.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222936,"text":"It's also not terribly hard to do it numerically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222937,"text":"And the reason why we're not doing it numerically is that, as I say, this is something that happens all across engineering.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222938,"text":"People are looking for these linear relationships between the change in some input and the change in the output.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222939,"text":"In this case the design of the satellite, it's very important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222940,"text":"The speed actually isn't just <EXPRESSION> speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222941,"text":"Because it's the relative speed of u to the satellite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222942,"text":"And you might be, it depends on your angle of sight with the satellite what the speed is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222943,"text":"So it varies quite a bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222944,"text":"So you really need this rule of thumb.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222945,"text":"Then there are all kinds of other considerations in this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222946,"text":"Like, for example, there's the fact that we're sitting on Earth and so we're rotating around on what's called a non-inertial frame.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222947,"text":"So there's the question of that acceleration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222948,"text":"There's the question that the gravity that I experience here on Earth is not the same as up at the satellite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222949,"text":"And that also creates a difference in time, as a result of general relativity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222950,"text":"So all of these considerations come down to formulas which are this complicated or maybe a tiny bit more.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222951,"text":"Not really that much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222952,"text":"And then people simplify them enormously to these very simple-minded rules.","entities":[{"id":87942,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222953,"text":"And they don't keep track of what's going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222954,"text":"So in order to design the system, you must make these simplifications, otherwise you can't even think about what's going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222955,"text":"This comes up in everything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222956,"text":"In weather forecasting, economic forecasting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222957,"text":"Figuring out whether there's going to be an asteroid that's going to hit the Earth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222958,"text":"Every single <EXPRESSION> of these things involves dozens of these considerations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222959,"text":"OK, there was a question that I saw, here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222960,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222962,"text":"Basically, any problem where you have a derivative, the rate of change also depends upon what the base point is.","entities":[{"id":87943,"label":"method","start_offset":40,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222963,"text":"That's the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222964,"text":"And so, this varies a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222965,"text":"In fact, that's sort of a <EXPRESSION> order effect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222966,"text":"It does change the constant of proportionality.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222967,"text":"It's a rate of change at a different base point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222968,"text":"Which we're considering fixed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222969,"text":"When you actually do the computations, what you discover is that it doesn't make that much difference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222970,"text":"To the a.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222971,"text":"And that's something that you get from experience.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222972,"text":"That it turns out, which things matter and which things don't.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222973,"text":"And yet again, that's exactly the same sort of consideration but at the next order of what I'm talking about here is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222974,"text":"You have to have enough experience with numbers to know that if you take, if you vary something a little bit it's not going to change the answer that you're looking for very much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222975,"text":"And that's exactly the point that I'm making.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222976,"text":"So I can't make them all at once, all such points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222977,"text":"So that's my pitch for understanding things from this point of view.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222978,"text":"Now, we're going to go on, now, to quadratic approximations, which are a little more complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222979,"text":"So, we talked a little bit about this last time but I didn't finish.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222980,"text":"So I want to finish this up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222981,"text":"OK, so, that's something that you really need to get a little experience with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222982,"text":"In economics, I told you they use logarithms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222983,"text":"And it's a mess.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222984,"text":"And people don't do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222985,"text":"So they stick with the quadratic ones, typically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222986,"text":"So the basic formula here, and I'm going to take the base point to be <EXPRESSION>, is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222987,"text":"That's the linear part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222988,"text":"Plus this extra term.","entities":[{"id":87945,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":4}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222989,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222990,"text":"And this is supposed to work for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222991,"text":"So it shows in the base point as simply as possible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222992,"text":"So here's more or less where we left off last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222993,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> thing that I said I was going to explain, which I will now, is why it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222994,"text":"So we need to know that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222995,"text":"So let's work that out here <EXPRESSION> of all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222996,"text":"So I'm just going to do it by example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222997,"text":"So if you like, the answer is just, well, what happens when you have a parabola?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222998,"text":"A parabola's a quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":222999,"text":"It had better, its quadratic approximation had better be itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223000,"text":"It's got to be the best <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223001,"text":"So it's got to be itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223002,"text":"So this formula, if it's going to work, has to work on the nose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223003,"text":"For quadratic functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223004,"text":"So, let's take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223005,"text":"If I differentiate, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87948,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223006,"text":"If I differentiate a <EXPRESSION> time, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87950,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223007,"text":"And now let's plug it in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223008,"text":"Well, we can recover, what is it that we want to recover?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223009,"text":"We want to recover these numbers <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> using the derivatives evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223010,"text":"So let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223011,"text":"It's pretty easy, actually.That's on the nose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223012,"text":"If you plug in <EQUATION><EQUATION>here, these terms drop out and you get a.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223013,"text":"And now, <EXPRESSION>, whoops that was wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223014,"text":"So I wrote <EXPRESSION> but what I meant was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223015,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223016,"text":"Let's back up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223017,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so if I plug in <EQUATION> I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223018,"text":"Now, <EXPRESSION>, that's this next formula here, <EXPRESSION>, I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, and I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223019,"text":"That's also good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223020,"text":"And that's exactly what the linear approximation is supposed to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223021,"text":"But now you notice, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223023,"text":"And that's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223024,"text":"That's the reason.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223025,"text":"There's no chance that any other formula could work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223026,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> does.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223027,"text":"So that's the explanation for the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223028,"text":"And now I remind you that I had a collection of basic formulas written on the board.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223029,"text":"And I want to just make sure we know all of them again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223030,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> of all, there was <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223031,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223032,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223033,"text":"So those were <EXPRESSION> that I mentioned last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223034,"text":"And, again, this is all for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223035,"text":"All for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION> only.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223036,"text":"These are wildly wrong, Far away, but near <EXPRESSION> they're nice, good, quadratic approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223038,"text":"So we can put it at <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223039,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> - sorry, this is an approximately = sign there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223040,"text":"Turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223041,"text":"And the last <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223042,"text":"Now, eventually, your mind will converge on all of these and you'll find them relatively easy to memorize.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223043,"text":"But it'll take some getting used to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223044,"text":"And I'm not claiming that you should recognize them and understand them all now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223045,"text":"But I'm going to put a giant box around this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223046,"text":"So the question was, you get all of these if you use that equation there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223047,"text":"That's exactly what are you going to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223048,"text":"so I already did it actually for these <EXPRESSION>, last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223049,"text":"But I didn't do it yet for these <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223050,"text":"But I will do it in about <EXPRESSION> minutes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223051,"text":"Well, maybe <EXPRESSION> minutes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223052,"text":"But <EXPRESSION> I want to explain just a few things about these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223053,"text":"They all follow from the basic formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223054,"text":"In fact, that <EXPRESSION> deserves a pink box too, doesn't it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223055,"text":"That <EXPRESSION>'s pretty important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223056,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223057,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223058,"text":"Maybe even some little sparkles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223059,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223060,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223061,"text":"So that's pretty important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223062,"text":"Almost as important as the more basic <EXPRESSION> without this term here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223063,"text":"So now, let me just tell you a little bit more about the significance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223064,"text":"Again, this is just to reinforce something that we've already done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223065,"text":"But it's closely related to what you're doing on your problem set.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223066,"text":"So it's worth your while to recall this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223067,"text":"So, there's this expression that we were dealing with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223068,"text":"And we talked about it in lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223069,"text":"So that's what we showed in lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223070,"text":"And the way that we did that was, we took the logarithm and we wrote it as <EXPRESSION> times, sorry, the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87961,"label":"command","start_offset":88,"end_offset":93}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223071,"text":"And then we evaluated the limit of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223072,"text":"And I want to do this limit again, using linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223073,"text":"To show you how easy it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223074,"text":"If you just remember the linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223075,"text":"And then we'll explain where the quadratic approximation comes in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223076,"text":"So I claim that this is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223077,"text":"Now, why is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223078,"text":"Well, that's just this linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223079,"text":"So what did I use here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223080,"text":"I used <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223081,"text":"Let <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":87963,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":3}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223082,"text":"That's what I used in this approximation here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223083,"text":"And that's the linear approximation to the natural logarithm.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223084,"text":"And this number is relatively easy to evaluate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223085,"text":"I know how to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223086,"text":"It's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223087,"text":"That's the same, well, so where does this work?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223088,"text":"This works where this thing is near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223089,"text":"Which is when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223090,"text":"This thing is working only when <EXPRESSION> is going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223091,"text":"So what it's really saying, this approximation formula, it's really saying that as we go to <EXPRESSION>, in <EXPRESSION>, this thing is going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223092,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223093,"text":"So that's what it's saying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223094,"text":"That's the substance there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223095,"text":"And that's how we want to use it, in many instances.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223096,"text":"Just to evaluate limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223097,"text":"We also want to realize that it's nearby when <EXPRESSION> is pretty large, like <EXPRESSION> or something like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223098,"text":"Now, so that's the idea of the linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223100,"text":"So convergence means how fast this is going towards that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223101,"text":"What I have to do is take the difference.","entities":[{"id":87966,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":25},{"id":87967,"label":"method","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223103,"text":"And I know that this is going to <EXPRESSION>, and the question is how big is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223104,"text":"We want it to be very small.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223105,"text":"And the answer we're going to get, so the answer just uses the quadratic approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223106,"text":"So if I just have a little bit more detail, then this expression here, in other words, I have the next higher order term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223107,"text":"This is like <EXPRESSION>, this is like <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223108,"text":"Then I can understand how big the difference is between the expression that I've got and its limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223109,"text":"And so that's what's on your homework.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223110,"text":"This is on your problem set.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223111,"text":"OK, so that is more or less an explanation for <EXPRESSION> of the things that quadratic approximations are good for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223112,"text":"And I'm going to give you <EXPRESSION> more illustration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223113,"text":"<EXPRESSION> more illustration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223114,"text":"And then we'll actually check these formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223115,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223116,"text":"The answer is, in real life when you're faced with a problem like this, where some satellite is orbiting and you want to know the effects of gravity or something like that, nobody is going to tell you anything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223117,"text":"They're not even going to tell you whether a linear approximation is relevant, or a quadratic or anything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223118,"text":"So you're on your own.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223119,"text":"When I give you a question, at least for right now, I'm always going to tell you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223122,"text":"You should always start trying with a linear <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223123,"text":"Because the quadratic ones are much more complicated as you'll see in this next example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223124,"text":"OK, so the example that I want to use is, you're going to be stuck with it because I'm asking for the quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223125,"text":"To what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223126,"text":"Well, this is the same function that we used in the last lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223127,"text":"I think this was it.OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223128,"text":"So, unfortunately, I stuck it in the wrong place to be able to fit this very long formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223129,"text":"So I'm going to switch it.","entities":[{"id":87978,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223130,"text":"I'm just going to write it here.","entities":[{"id":87979,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223131,"text":"And we're going to just do the approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223133,"text":"And we'll say <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87981,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223134,"text":"So that's what I want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223135,"text":"So now, here's what I have to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223137,"text":"And so that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223139,"text":"because <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223140,"text":"And so that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223141,"text":"So this is the <EXPRESSION> term, and this is the <EXPRESSION> term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223142,"text":"And now I'm going to do something which is the only good thing about quadratic approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223143,"text":"They're messy, they're long, there's nothing particularly good about them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223144,"text":"But there is <EXPRESSION> good thing about them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223145,"text":"Which is that you always get to ignore the higher order terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223146,"text":"So even though this looks like a very ugly multiplication, I can do it in my head.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223147,"text":"Just watching it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223148,"text":"Because I get a <EXPRESSION>, I'm forced with that term here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223149,"text":"And then I get the cross terms which are linear, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223150,"text":"We already did that when we calculated the linear approximation, so that's this times the <EXPRESSION> and this times that <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87989,"label":"command","start_offset":80,"end_offset":85},{"id":87990,"label":"command","start_offset":112,"end_offset":117}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223151,"text":"And now I have <EXPRESSION> cross-terms which are quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223152,"text":"So that's plus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87991,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223153,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223154,"text":"And then there's this term, multiplying the <EXPRESSION>, that's plus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":87992,"label":"command","start_offset":65,"end_offset":69}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223155,"text":"Multiplying <EXPRESSION>, and that is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223156,"text":"So the great thing is, we drop <EXPRESSION>, etc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223157,"text":"And you work it out as I'm doing it now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223158,"text":"So what I did is, I multiplied <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223159,"text":"I'm using the distributive law here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223160,"text":"That was this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223161,"text":"I multiplied this <EXPRESSION> by this <EXPRESSION>, that was that term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223162,"text":"I multiplied this by this, that's that term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223163,"text":"And then I multiplied this by this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223164,"text":"In other words, <EXPRESSION> terms that gave me an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223165,"text":"And I'm going to stop at that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223166,"text":"Because the point is it's just all the rest of the terms that come up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223167,"text":"I don't have to do the higher ones.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223168,"text":"Another question, way back here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223169,"text":"Yeah, right there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223170,"text":"So somebody can check my arithmetic, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223171,"text":"Good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223172,"text":"So if here's about <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223173,"text":"Here's something which is on the order of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223174,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223175,"text":"And the point is that I'm not claiming that I have an exact answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223176,"text":"And I'm going to drop things of that order of magnitude.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223177,"text":"So I'm saving everything up to <EXPRESSION> decimal places.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223178,"text":"I'm throwing away things which are <EXPRESSION> decimal places out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223179,"text":"Does that answer your question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223180,"text":"That's the situation, and now you can combine the terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223181,"text":"I mean, it's not very impressive here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223182,"text":"This = <EXPRESSION>, maybe <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223183,"text":"Anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223184,"text":"So, this is a <EXPRESSION> here, sorry.This is the linear approximation we got last time and here's the extra information that we got from this calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223185,"text":"Which is this <EXPRESSION> term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223187,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> of the things to realize is that these kinds of problems, because they involve many, many terms are always going to involve a little bit of complicated arithmetic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223188,"text":"Did the ones in the left column.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223189,"text":"So let's carry that out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223190,"text":"And as someone just pointed out, it all comes from this formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223191,"text":"So let's just check it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223192,"text":"So we'll start with the ln function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223193,"text":"This is the function, <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223194,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, this is <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223195,"text":"And now I have to plug in <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223196,"text":"So at <EQUATION> this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223197,"text":"So this is at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223198,"text":"I'm getting <EXPRESSION> here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223199,"text":"And here, I plug in <EXPRESSION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223200,"text":"So now I go and I look up at that formula, which is way in that upper corner there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223201,"text":"And I see that the coefficient on the constant is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223202,"text":"The coefficient on <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223203,"text":"And then the other coefficient, the very last <EXPRESSION>, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223204,"text":"So this is the <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223205,"text":"And then in the formula, there's a <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.","entities":[{"id":88000,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":55,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223206,"text":"So it's half of whatever I get for this <EXPRESSION> derivative, at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88002,"label":"method","start_offset":53,"end_offset":63}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223207,"text":"So this is the approximation formula, which is way up in that corner there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223208,"text":"Similarly, if I do it for <EXPRESSION>, I have to differentiate that I get <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88003,"label":"command","start_offset":50,"end_offset":63}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223209,"text":"So here are the derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223210,"text":"And so if I evaluate them at <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223211,"text":"That's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223212,"text":"And here I get <EXPRESSION>.And here, I plug in <EQUATION> and I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223213,"text":"So again, the pattern is right above it here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223214,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> is there, the <EXPRESSION> is there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223215,"text":"And then instead of <EXPRESSION>, I have half that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223216,"text":"For the coefficient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223217,"text":"So these are just examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223218,"text":"Obviously if we had a more complicated functional, we might carry this out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223220,"text":"So I want to shift gears now and treat the subject that was supposed to be this lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223221,"text":"And we're not quite caught up, but we will try to do our best to do as much as we can today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223222,"text":"So the next topic is curve sketching.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223223,"text":"And so let's get started with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223224,"text":"So now, happily in this subject, there are more pictures and it's a little bit more geometric.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223225,"text":"And there's relatively little computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223226,"text":"So let's hope we can do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223227,"text":"So I want to, so here we go, we'll start with curve sketching.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223228,"text":"Yeah, there are certain kinds of things which I can't spell.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223229,"text":"But, alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223230,"text":"Sketching.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223231,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223232,"text":"So here's our goal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223233,"text":"Our goal is to draw the graph of <EXPRESSION>, using <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88014,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":19},{"id":88015,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223234,"text":"Whether they're positive or negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223235,"text":"So that's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223236,"text":"This is the goal here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223237,"text":"However, there is a big warning that I want to give you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223239,"text":"So this will be harder for those of you who have actually done this before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223240,"text":"But for the rest of you, it will be relatively easy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223241,"text":"Which is, don't abandon your precalculus skills.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223242,"text":"And common sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223243,"text":"So there's a great deal of common sense in this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223244,"text":"And it actually trumps some of the calculus.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223245,"text":"The calculus just fills in what you didn't quite know yet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223246,"text":"So I will try to illustrate this.","entities":[{"id":88016,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223247,"text":"And because we're running a bit late, I won't get to the some of the main punchlines until next lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223248,"text":"But I want you to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223249,"text":"So for now, I'm just going to tell you about the general principles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223250,"text":"And in the process I'm going to introduce the terminology.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223251,"text":"Just, the words that we need to use to describe what is that we're doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223252,"text":"And there's also a certain amount of carelessness with that in many of the treatments that you'll see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223253,"text":"And a lot of hastiness.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223254,"text":"So just be a little patient and we will do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223255,"text":"So, the <EXPRESSION> principle is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223256,"text":"That's a straightforward idea, and it's closely related to this tangent line approximation or the linear approximation that I just did.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223257,"text":"You can just imagine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223258,"text":"Here's the tangent line, here's the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223259,"text":"And if the tangent line is pointing up, then the function is also going up, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223260,"text":"So that's all that's going on here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223261,"text":"And that's the basic idea.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223262,"text":"Now, the <EXPRESSION> step is also fairly straightforward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223263,"text":"If you have <EXPRESSION> as positive, then that means that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223264,"text":"That's the same principle applied <EXPRESSION> step up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223265,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223266,"text":"Because if <EXPRESSION> is positive, that means it's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88019,"label":"method","start_offset":57,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223267,"text":"So it's the same principle just repeated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223268,"text":"And now I just want to draw a picture of this.","entities":[{"id":88020,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223269,"text":"Here's a picture of it, I claim.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223270,"text":"And it looks like something's going down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223271,"text":"And I did that on purpose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223272,"text":"But there is something that's increasing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223273,"text":"Which is, the slope is very steep negative here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223274,"text":"And it's less steep negative over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223275,"text":"So we have the slope which is some negative number, say, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88021,"label":"command","start_offset":52,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223276,"text":"And here it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223277,"text":"So it's increasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223278,"text":"It's getting less negative, and maybe eventually it'll curve up the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223279,"text":"And this is a picture of what I'm talking about here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223280,"text":"That's what it means to say that <EXPRESSION> is increasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223281,"text":"The slope is getting larger.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223282,"text":"And the way to describe a curve like this is that it's concave.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223283,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is concave up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223284,"text":"And similarly, <EXPRESSION> negative is going to be the same thing as <EXPRESSION> concave, or implies <EXPRESSION> concave down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223285,"text":"So those are the ways in which derivatives will help us qualitatively to draw graphs.","entities":[{"id":88023,"label":"command","start_offset":73,"end_offset":77}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223287,"text":"These are just the additional bits of help that we have from calculus.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223288,"text":"In drawing pictures.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223289,"text":"So I'm going to go through <EXPRESSION> example to introduce all the notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223290,"text":"And then eventually, so probably at the beginning of next time, I'll give you a systematic strategy that's going to work when what I'm describing now goes wrong, or a little bit wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223291,"text":"So let's begin with a straightforward example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223292,"text":"So, the <EXPRESSION> example that I'll give you is the function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223293,"text":"Just, as I said, to be able to introduce all the notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223294,"text":"Now, if you differentiate it, you get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88026,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223295,"text":"And I can factor that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223296,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223298,"text":"And so, I can decide whether the derivative is positive or negative.","entities":[{"id":88028,"label":"method","start_offset":33,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223299,"text":"Easily enough.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223300,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is a positive number and <EXPRESSION> is a positive number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223301,"text":"So, in this range, <EXPRESSION> is positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223302,"text":"So this thing is, so <EXPRESSION> is increasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223304,"text":"And so <EXPRESSION> is decreasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223305,"text":"And the same thing goes for the other side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223306,"text":"When it's less than <EXPRESSION>, that also works this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223307,"text":"Because when it's less than <EXPRESSION>, this number factors positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223308,"text":"But the other <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223309,"text":"So in both of these cases, we get that it's decreasing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223310,"text":"So now, here's the schematic picture of this function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223311,"text":"So here's <EXPRESSION>, here's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223312,"text":"It's going to go down, up, down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223313,"text":"That's what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223314,"text":"Maybe I'll just leave it alone like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223315,"text":"That's what it looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223316,"text":"So, this is the kind of information we can get right off the bat.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223317,"text":"And you notice immediately that it's very important, from the features of the function, the sort of key features of the function that we see here, are these <EXPRESSION> places.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223318,"text":"Maybe I'll even mark them in a, like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223319,"text":"And these things are turning points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223320,"text":"So what are they?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223321,"text":"Well, they're just the points where the derivative changes sign.","entities":[{"id":88032,"label":"method","start_offset":40,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223322,"text":"Where it's negative here and it's positive there, so there it must be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223323,"text":"So we have a definition, and this is the most important definition in this subject, which is that is if <EXPRESSION>, we call <EXPRESSION> a critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223324,"text":"The word 'turning point' is not used just because, in fact, it doesn't have to turn around at those points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223325,"text":"But certainly, if it turns around then this will happen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223326,"text":"And we also have another notation, which is the number <EXPRESSION> which is <EXPRESSION> is called a critical value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223327,"text":"So these are the key numbers that we're going to have to work out in order to understand what the function looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223328,"text":"So what I'm going to do is just plot them.","entities":[{"id":88033,"label":"command","start_offset":32,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223329,"text":"We're going to plot the critical points and the values.","entities":[{"id":88034,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223330,"text":"Well, we found the critical points relatively easily.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223332,"text":"If you set <EQUATION>, that implies that <EQUATION>, which implies that <EXPRESSION> is or <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88036,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":10}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223333,"text":"So those are known as the critical points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223335,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223336,"text":"And so I can plot the function here.","entities":[{"id":88038,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223337,"text":"So here's the point <EXPRESSION> and here's, up here, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223338,"text":"So this is - whoops, which <EXPRESSION> is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223339,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223340,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223341,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223342,"text":"And then over here, I have the point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223343,"text":"Alright, now, what information do I get from - so I've now plotted <EXPRESSION>, I claim, very interesting points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223344,"text":"What information do I get from this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223345,"text":"The answer is, I know something very nearby.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223346,"text":"Because I've already checked that the thing is coming down from the left, and coming back up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223347,"text":"And so it must be shaped like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223348,"text":"Over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223349,"text":"The tangent line is <EXPRESSION>, it's going to be level there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223350,"text":"And similarly over here, it's going to do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223351,"text":"So this is what we know so far, based on what we've computed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223352,"text":"Question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223353,"text":"The answer is, calculus, it's not called a critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223354,"text":"It's a something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223355,"text":"And it's a very important point, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223356,"text":"And we will be discussing those kinds of points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223357,"text":"There are much more dramatic instances of that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223358,"text":"That's part of what we're going to say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223359,"text":"But I just want to save that, alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223360,"text":"We will be discussing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223361,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223362,"text":"Question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223364,"text":"What I used is another piece of information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223365,"text":"I used the information that I derived over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223366,"text":"That <EXPRESSION> is positive, where <EXPRESSION> is positive and where it's negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223367,"text":"So what I know is that the graph is going down to the left of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223368,"text":"It's going up to the right, here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223369,"text":"It's going up here and it's going down there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223371,"text":"I used the <EXPRESSION> derivative.","entities":[{"id":88050,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223372,"text":"OK, but I didn't just use the fact that there was a turning point here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223373,"text":"So, actually, I was using the fact that it was a turning point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223374,"text":"I wasn't using the fact that it had the <EXPRESSION> derivative, though.","entities":[{"id":88052,"label":"method","start_offset":53,"end_offset":63}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223375,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223376,"text":"For now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223377,"text":"You can also see it by the <EXPRESSION> derivative as well.","entities":[{"id":88053,"label":"method","start_offset":40,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223379,"text":"And I just want to do it a little bit carefully here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223380,"text":"In the order that is reasonable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223381,"text":"Now, you might happen to notice, and there's nothing wrong with this, so let's even fill in a guess.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223382,"text":"In order to fill in a guess, though, and have it be even vaguely right, I do have to notice that this thing crosses, this function crosses the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223383,"text":"The function <EQUATION> happens also have the property that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223384,"text":"Again, common sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223385,"text":"You're allowed to use your common sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223386,"text":"You're allowed to notice a value of the function and put it in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223387,"text":"So there's nothing wrong with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223388,"text":"If you happen to have such a value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223389,"text":"So, now we can guess what our function is going to look like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223390,"text":"It's going to maybe come down like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223391,"text":"Come up like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223392,"text":"And come down like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223393,"text":"That could be what it looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223394,"text":"But, you know, another possibility is it sort of comes along here and goes out that way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223395,"text":"Comes along here and goes out that way, who knows?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223396,"text":"It happens, by the way, that it's an odd function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223397,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223398,"text":"Those are all odd powers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223399,"text":"So, actually, it's symmetric on the right half and the left half.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223400,"text":"And crosses at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223401,"text":"So everything that we do on the right is going to be the same as what happens on the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223402,"text":"That's another piece of common sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223403,"text":"You want to make use of that as much as possible, whenever you're drawing anything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223404,"text":"Don't want to throw out information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223405,"text":"So this function happens to be odd.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223406,"text":"Odd, and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223407,"text":"I'm considering those to be kinds of precalculus skills that I want you to use as much as you can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223408,"text":"So now, here's the <EXPRESSION> feature which is unfortunately ignored in most discussions of functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223409,"text":"And it's strange, because nowadays we have graphing things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223410,"text":"And it's really the only part of the exercise that you couldn't do, at least on this relatively simpleminded level, with a graphing calculator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223411,"text":"And that is what I would call the ends of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223412,"text":"So what happens off the screen, is the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223413,"text":"And that basically is the theoretical part of the problem that you have to address.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223414,"text":"You can program this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223415,"text":"You can draw all the pictures that you want.","entities":[{"id":88063,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223416,"text":"But what you won't see is what's off the screen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223417,"text":"You need to know something to figure out what's off the screen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223418,"text":"So, in this case, I'm talking about what's off the screen going to the right, or going to the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223419,"text":"So let's check the ends.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223420,"text":"So here, let's just take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223421,"text":"We have the function <EXPRESSION>, which is, sorry, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223422,"text":"Again this is a precalculus sort of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223423,"text":"And we're imagining now, let's just do <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223424,"text":"So what happens here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223425,"text":"When <EXPRESSION> is gigantic, this term is completely negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223426,"text":"And it just behaves like <EXPRESSION>, which goes to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> goes to plus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":88067,"label":"command","start_offset":90,"end_offset":94}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223427,"text":"And similarly, <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> if <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223428,"text":"Let's have we have <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223429,"text":"Or I guess we can just say <EQUATION> if we didn't want to write it with the function notation.","entities":[{"id":88068,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":26},{"id":88069,"label":"command","start_offset":59,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223430,"text":"And that's all fair and well and this works out well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223431,"text":"This is a separable differential equation and we can integrate things quite easily.","entities":[{"id":88070,"label":"command","start_offset":53,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223432,"text":"But as you will see as you go further in the world of differential equations, most differential equations are not so easy to solve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223433,"text":"In fact, many of them are impossible to solve using analytic methods.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223434,"text":"And so given that, what do you do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223435,"text":"We've nicely described some phenomena, modeled some phenomena using the differential equations but if you can't solve it analytically do you just give up?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223436,"text":"And the answer to that question is no.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223437,"text":"You do not just give up because we now have computers, and computers are really good at numerical methods.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223438,"text":"Numerical methods for approximating and giving us a sense of what the solution to a differential equation might look like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":223440,"text":"Well, in this video we can explore <EXPRESSION> of the most straightforward numerical methods for approximating a particular solution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223441,"text":"So what we do is, so I'm gonna draw a little table here.","entities":[{"id":88071,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223442,"text":"So, a little table here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223443,"text":"Actually let give myself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":223448,"text":"You could just pick all the.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":223450,"text":"And we're gonna do something kind of related but instead of trying to construct a slope field, we're gonna start with this initial condition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
