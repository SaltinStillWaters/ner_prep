{"id":66928,"text":"So, what is the minimum?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66929,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66930,"text":"Right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66931,"text":"The lowest value of the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66932,"text":"So the answer to that question is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66933,"text":"Now, the problem with this question and you will, so that refers to the minimum value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66934,"text":"But then there's this other question which is where is the minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66935,"text":"And the answer to that is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66937,"text":"So they're <EXPRESSION> separate things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66938,"text":"Now, the problem is that people are sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66940,"text":"Now, both questions are important to answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66941,"text":"You just need to have a word to put there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66942,"text":"So this is a little bit careless.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66943,"text":"When we say what is the minimum, some people will say <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66944,"text":"And that's literally wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66945,"text":"They know what they mean.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66946,"text":"But it's just wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66947,"text":"And when people ask this question, they're being sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66948,"text":"Anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66949,"text":"They should maybe be a little clearer and say what's the minimum value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66950,"text":"Or, where is the value achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66951,"text":"It's achieved at, or where is the minimum value achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66952,"text":"\"Where is min achieved?\", would be a better way of phrasing this <EXPRESSION> question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66953,"text":"So that it has an unambiguous answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66954,"text":"And when people ask you for the minimum point, they're also - so why is it that we call it the minimum point?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66955,"text":"We have this word, critical point, which is what <EQUATION> is in critical value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66956,"text":"And so I'm making those same distinctions here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66957,"text":"But there's another notion of a minimum point, and this is an alternative if you like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66959,"text":"Right, that's a point on the graph.","entities":[{"id":85674,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66960,"text":"It's the point - well, so that graph is way up there, but I'll just put it on there.","entities":[{"id":85675,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66961,"text":"That's this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66962,"text":"And you might say min there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66963,"text":"And you might point to this point, and you might say max.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66964,"text":"And similarly, this <EXPRESSION> might be a max.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66965,"text":"So in other words, what this means is simply that people are a little sloppy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66966,"text":"And sometimes they mean <EXPRESSION> thing and sometimes they mean another.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66968,"text":"Yeah?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66969,"text":"OK, so that's a good - very good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66970,"text":"So here we go, find the largest area enclosed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66971,"text":"So that's sort of a trick question, isn't it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66972,"text":"So there are various - that's a good thing to ask.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66973,"text":"That's sort of a trick question, why?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66974,"text":"Because according to the rules, we're trapped between the <EXPRESSION> maxima at something which is strictly below.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66975,"text":"So in other words, <EXPRESSION> answer to this question would be, and this is the answer that I would probably give, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66976,"text":"But that's not really true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66977,"text":"Because that's only in the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66978,"text":"As <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, or as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66979,"text":"And if you like, the most is when you've only got <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66980,"text":"Which breaks the rules of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66981,"text":"So, essentially, it's a trick question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66982,"text":"But I would answer it this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66984,"text":"So now, let's do another example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66986,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66987,"text":"The question is, since the question was, what was the largest area, why did we find the least area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66988,"text":"The reason is that when we go about our procedure of looking for the least, or the most, we'll automatically find both.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66989,"text":"Because we don't know which <EXPRESSION> is which until we compare values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66990,"text":"And actually, it's much more to your advantage to figure out both the maximum and minimum whenever you answer such a question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66991,"text":"Because otherwise you won't understand the behavior of the function very well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66992,"text":"So, the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66995,"text":"We answered the question of what the largest and the smallest value was.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66996,"text":"Also, I'm wondering if you can check both the minimum  approaches .","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66997,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":66999,"text":"And the answer is, yes we can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67001,"text":"So it's always curving up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67002,"text":"It's a parabola with a positive <EXPRESSION> coefficient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67003,"text":"So you can differentiate this twice.","entities":[{"id":85682,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67005,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> derivative is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85683,"label":"method","start_offset":20,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67006,"text":"Is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67007,"text":"And that's an acceptable way of figuring it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67008,"text":"I'll mention the <EXPRESSION> derivative test again, in this <EXPRESSION> example.","entities":[{"id":85684,"label":"method","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67010,"text":"So again, this is going to be another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67011,"text":"The question is, when I say minimum or maximum point which will I mean.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67012,"text":"So I just repeated the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67013,"text":"So the question is, when I say minimum point, what will I mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67014,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67015,"text":"And the answer is that for the purposes of this class I will probably avoid saying that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67016,"text":"But I will say, probably, where is the minimum achieved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67017,"text":"Just in order to avoid that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67020,"text":"And I'll make this very clear when we were doing this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67022,"text":"So let's do another example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67023,"text":"So this is an example to get us used to the notion of constraints.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67024,"text":"So we have, so consider a box without a top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67025,"text":"Or, if you like, we're going to find the box without a top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67026,"text":"With least surface area for a fixed volume.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67027,"text":"Find the box without a top with least surface area for a fixed volume.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67028,"text":"The procedure for working this out is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67029,"text":"You make this diagram.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67033,"text":"And we'll choose them in a kind of a standard way, alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67034,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> I have to tell you <EXPRESSION> more thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67035,"text":"Which is something that we could calculate separately but I'm just going to give it to you in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67037,"text":"And that's going to get rid of <EXPRESSION> of our variables for us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67038,"text":"So it's got a square bottom, and so let's draw a picture of it.","entities":[{"id":85695,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67039,"text":"So here's our box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67040,"text":"Well, that goes down like this, almost.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67041,"text":"Maybe I should get it a little farther down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67042,"text":"So here's our box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67043,"text":"Let's correct that just a bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67044,"text":"So now, what about the dimensions of this box?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67045,"text":"Well, this is going to be <EXPRESSION>, and this is very foreshortened, but it's also <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67046,"text":"The bottom is <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, it's the same dimensions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67047,"text":"And then the vertical dimension is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67048,"text":"So far, so good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67050,"text":"I want to compute the volume.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67051,"text":"The volume is, the base is <EXPRESSION>, and the height is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67052,"text":"So there's the volume.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67053,"text":"And then the area, the area is the area of the bottom, which is <EXPRESSION>, that's the bottom.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67054,"text":"And then there are the <EXPRESSION> sides.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67057,"text":"So these are the sides.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67058,"text":"And remember, there's no top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67059,"text":"So that's our setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67061,"text":"But there's what's called a constraint here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67062,"text":"Namely, we've fixed the relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67063,"text":"And so, that means that we can solve for <EXPRESSION> in terms of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67064,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67066,"text":"So here we have a which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67067,"text":"Question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67068,"text":"The question is, will you need to know this intuitively?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67069,"text":"No.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67070,"text":"That's something that I would have to give to you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67071,"text":"I mean, it's actually true that a lot of things, the correct answer is something symmetric.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67073,"text":"And similarly, here, what happens is if you elongate <EXPRESSION> side, you get less - it actually is involved with a <EXPRESSION> variable problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67074,"text":"Namely, if you have a rectangle and you have a certain amount of length associated with it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67075,"text":"What's the optimal thing you can do with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67076,"text":"But I won't, in other words, the optimal rectangle, the least perimeter rectangle, turns out to be a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67078,"text":"But so that would have been a separate max-min problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67079,"text":"Which I'm skipping, because I what to do this slightly more interesting <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67080,"text":"So now, here's our formula for a, and now I want to follow the same procedure as before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67081,"text":"Namely, we look for the critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67082,"text":"Or points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67083,"text":"So let's take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67084,"text":"So again, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67085,"text":"And <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67086,"text":"So if we set that = <EXPRESSION>, we get <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":85700,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67087,"text":"So <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67088,"text":"How did that happen to change into <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67089,"text":"Interesting, guess that's wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67090,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67091,"text":"So this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67092,"text":"And so <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67093,"text":"So this is the critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67094,"text":"So we are not done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67095,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67096,"text":"We're not done, because we don't even know whether this is going to give us the worst box or the best box, from this point of view.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67098,"text":"So let's check the ends, right away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67099,"text":"To see what's happening.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67100,"text":"So can somebody tell me what the ends, what the end values of <EXPRESSION> are?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67101,"text":"Where does <EXPRESSION> range from?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67102,"text":"What's the smallest <EXPRESSION> can be, yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67103,"text":"OK, the claim was that the largest <EXPRESSION> could be <EXPRESSION>, because somehow there's this <EXPRESSION> here and you can't get any further past than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67104,"text":"But there's a key feature here of this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67105,"text":"Which is that a is variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67106,"text":"The only thing that's fixed in the problem is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67107,"text":"So if <EXPRESSION> is fixed, what do you know about <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67108,"text":"<EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67109,"text":"The lower end point, that's safe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67110,"text":"Because that has to do geometrically with the fact that we don't have any boxes with negative dimensions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67111,"text":"That would be refused by the Post Office, definitely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67112,"text":"Over and above the empty top, which they wouldn't accept either.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67113,"text":"It's true that <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67114,"text":"So that's using this relationship.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67115,"text":"But notice that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67116,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, I just got a guess there over here, that's right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67117,"text":"Here's the upper limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67118,"text":"So this is really important to realize.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67119,"text":"This is most problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67120,"text":"Most problems, the variable if it doesn't have a limitation, usually just goes out to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67121,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is a very important end for the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67122,"text":"It's usually an easy end to the problem, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67123,"text":"So there's a possibility that if we push all the way down to <EQUATION>, we'll get a better box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67124,"text":"It would be very strange box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67125,"text":"A little bit like our vanishing enclosure.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67126,"text":"And maybe an infinitely long box, also very inconvenient <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67127,"text":"Might be the best box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67128,"text":"We'll have to see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67129,"text":"So let's just take a look at what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67130,"text":"So we're looking at <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67131,"text":"And that's <EXPRESSION> with <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67132,"text":"So what happens to that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67133,"text":"Notice right here, this is going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67134,"text":"So this is infinite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67135,"text":"So that turns out to be a bad box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67136,"text":"Let's take a look at the other end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67137,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> going to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67138,"text":"And again, this term here means that this thing is infinite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67139,"text":"So the shape of this thing, I'll draw this tiny little schematic diagram over here.","entities":[{"id":85709,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67140,"text":"The shape of this thing is like this, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67141,"text":"And so, when we find that <EXPRESSION> turnaround point, which happened to be at this strange point <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, that is going to be the minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67142,"text":"So we've just discovered that it's the minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67143,"text":"Which is just what we were hoping for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67144,"text":"This is going to be the optimal box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67145,"text":"Now, since you asked earlier and since it's worth checking this as well, let's also check an alternative justification.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67146,"text":"So an alternative to checking ends is the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.","entities":[{"id":85710,"label":"method","start_offset":55,"end_offset":65}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67147,"text":"I do not recommend the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.","entities":[{"id":85711,"label":"method","start_offset":36,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67148,"text":"I try my best, when I give you problems, to make it really hard to apply the <EXPRESSION> derivative test.","entities":[{"id":85712,"label":"command","start_offset":67,"end_offset":72},{"id":85713,"label":"method","start_offset":90,"end_offset":100}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67149,"text":"But in this example, the function is simple enough so that it's perfectly OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67150,"text":"If you take the derivative here, remember, this was whatever it was, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85714,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":11},{"id":85715,"label":"method","start_offset":16,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67152,"text":"And that's positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67153,"text":"So this thing is concave up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67154,"text":"And that's consistent with its being, the critical point is a min.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67155,"text":"Is a minimum point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67156,"text":"See how I almost said, is a min, as opposed to minimum point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67157,"text":"So watch out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67158,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67159,"text":"You're <EXPRESSION> step ahead of me.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67160,"text":"The question is, is this the answer to the question or would we have to give <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> and so on and so forth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67161,"text":"So, again, this is something that I want to emphasize and take my time with right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67162,"text":"Because it depends, what kind of real life problem you're answering, what kind of answer is appropriate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67163,"text":"So, so far we've found the critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67164,"text":"We haven't found the critical value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67165,"text":"We haven't found the dimensions of the box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67166,"text":"So we're going to spend a little bit more time on this, exactly in order to address these questions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67167,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> of all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67168,"text":"The value of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67169,"text":"So, so far we have <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67170,"text":"And certainly if you're going to build the box, you also want to know what the <EXPRESSION> value is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67171,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> value is going to be, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67173,"text":"So there's the <EXPRESSION> value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67174,"text":"On top of that, we could figure out the value of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67175,"text":"So that's also a perfectly reasonable part of the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67176,"text":"Depending on what <EXPRESSION> is interested in, you might care how much money it's going to cost you to build this box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67177,"text":"This optimal box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67178,"text":"And so you plug in the value of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67180,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67181,"text":"So that's going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67183,"text":"So if you like, <EXPRESSION> way of answering this question is these <EXPRESSION> things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67184,"text":"That would be the minimum point corresponding to the graph.","entities":[{"id":85720,"label":"command","start_offset":53,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67185,"text":"That would be the answer to this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67186,"text":"But the reason why I'm carrying it out in such detail is I want to show you that there are much more meaningful ways of answering this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67187,"text":"So let me explain that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67188,"text":"So let me go through some more meaningful answers here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67192,"text":"That happens to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67193,"text":"So that's <EXPRESSION> thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67194,"text":"If you want to expand the volume, you'll have to expand the area by the <EXPRESSION> of the volume.","entities":[{"id":85721,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":21},{"id":85722,"label":"command","start_offset":49,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67196,"text":"The other dimensionless quantity is the <EXPRESSION>:<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67197,"text":"So <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67198,"text":"So, again, that's inches divided by inches.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67199,"text":"And it's <EXPRESSION>, which happens to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67200,"text":"So this is actually the best answer to the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67201,"text":"And it shows you that the box is a <EXPRESSION>:<EXPRESSION> box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67202,"text":"If this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>, that's the good box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67203,"text":"And that is just the shape, if you like, and it's the optimal shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67204,"text":"And certainly that, aesthetically, that's the cleanest answer to the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67205,"text":"There was a question right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67206,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67207,"text":"Could you repeat that, I couldn't hear.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67209,"text":"The question is, could we have gotten the answer if we weren't told that the bottom was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67210,"text":"The answer is, yes in <EXPRESSION> with multivariable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67211,"text":"You would have to have <EXPRESSION> letters here, an <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>, and a <EXPRESSION>, if you like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67212,"text":"And then you'd have to work with all <EXPRESSION> of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67213,"text":"So I separated out into <EXPRESSION>, there's a separate <EXPRESSION> variable problem that you can do for the base.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67214,"text":"And then this is a <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> variable problem for this other thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67215,"text":"And it's just <EXPRESSION> consecutive <EXPRESSION> variable problems that solve the multivariable problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67218,"text":"Why did I divide <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, rather than <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, or in any?","entities":[{"id":85726,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67219,"text":"So, again, what I was aiming for was dimensionless quantities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67220,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are measured in the same units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67221,"text":"And also the proportions of the box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67222,"text":"So that's another word for this is proportions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67223,"text":"Are something that's universal, independent of the volume <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67224,"text":"It's something you can say about any box, at any scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67225,"text":"Whether it be, you know, something by Cristo in the Common.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67226,"text":"Maybe we'll get in here to do some fancy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67227,"text":"The proportions is with geometric problems typically, when there's a scaling to the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67228,"text":"Where the answer is the same at small scales and at large scales.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67229,"text":"This is capturing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67230,"text":"So that's why, the ratios are what's capturing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67231,"text":"And that's why it's aesthetically the nicest thing to ask.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67232,"text":"So, what exactly does the ratio of the <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> ratio  tell us?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67233,"text":"Unfortunately, this number is a really obscure number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67234,"text":"So the question is what does this tell us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67235,"text":"The only thing that I want to emphasize is what's on the left-hand side here.","entities":[{"id":85729,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":57,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67238,"text":"What you want to take is the square of circumference to area.","entities":[{"id":85731,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":21},{"id":85732,"label":"method","start_offset":29,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67241,"text":"So, again, it's these dimensionless quantities that you want to cook up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67242,"text":"And those are the ones that will have universal properties.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67243,"text":"The most famous of these is the circle that encloses the most area for its circumference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67244,"text":"And, again, that's only true if you take the square of the circumference.","entities":[{"id":85736,"label":"command","start_offset":36,"end_offset":40},{"id":85737,"label":"method","start_offset":45,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67245,"text":"You do the units correctly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67246,"text":"Anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67247,"text":"So we're here, we've got a shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67248,"text":"We've got an answer to this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67249,"text":"And I now want to do this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67250,"text":"Well, let's put it this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67251,"text":"I wanted to do this problem by a different method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67252,"text":"I think I'll take the time to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67253,"text":"So I want to do this problem by a slightly different method here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67255,"text":"So the same example, but now I'm going to do it by implicit differentiation.","entities":[{"id":85740,"label":"method","start_offset":60,"end_offset":75}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67256,"text":"Well, I'll tell you the advantages and disadvantages to this method here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67257,"text":"So the situation is, you have to start the same way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67258,"text":"So here is the starting place of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67259,"text":"And the goal was the minimum of a with <EXPRESSION> constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67260,"text":"So this was the situation that we were in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67261,"text":"And now, what I want to do is just differentiate.","entities":[{"id":85741,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67262,"text":"The function <EXPRESSION> is implicitly a function of <EXPRESSION>, so I can differentiate the <EXPRESSION> expression.","entities":[{"id":85742,"label":"command","start_offset":77,"end_offset":90}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67263,"text":"And that yields <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67264,"text":"So this is giving me my implicit formula for <EXPRESSION>, So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67265,"text":"Or in other words, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67266,"text":"And then I also have the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67267,"text":"Now, you may notice I'm not using primes quite as much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67268,"text":"Because all of the variables are varying, and so here I'm emphasizing that it's a differentiation with respect to the variable <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85743,"label":"method","start_offset":82,"end_offset":97}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67269,"text":"And this becomes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67270,"text":"So again, this is using the product rule.","entities":[{"id":85744,"label":"method","start_offset":28,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67271,"text":"And now I can plug in for what <EXPRESSION> is, which is right above it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67272,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67273,"text":"And that's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67274,"text":"And so let's gather that together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67275,"text":"So what do we have?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67276,"text":"We have <EXPRESSION>, and then, altogether, this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67277,"text":"So that's the same thing as <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67278,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> goes to the other side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67279,"text":"And so, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67280,"text":"So this, I claim, so you have to decide for yourself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67281,"text":"But I claim that this is faster.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67282,"text":"It's faster, and also it gets to the heart of the matter, which is this scale in variant proportions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67283,"text":"Which is basically also nicer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67284,"text":"So it gets to the nicer answer, also.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67285,"text":"So those are the advantages that this has.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67286,"text":"So it's faster, and it gets to this, I'm going to call it nicer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67287,"text":"And the disadvantage is it did not check.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67288,"text":"Whether this critical point is a max, min, or neither.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67289,"text":"So we didn't quite finish the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67290,"text":"But we got to the answer very fast.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67291,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67293,"text":"Well, so it gives you a candidate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67294,"text":"The answer is - so the question is, how would you check it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67295,"text":"The answer is that for this particular problem, the only way to do it is to do something like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67296,"text":"So in other words, it doesn't save you that much time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67298,"text":"Things like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67299,"text":"So in many, many, cases this is just as good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67300,"text":"So now I'm going to change subjects here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67301,"text":"But the subject that I'm going to talk about next is almost, is very, very closely linked.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67302,"text":"Namely, I talked about implicit differentiation.","entities":[{"id":85747,"label":"method","start_offset":32,"end_offset":47}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67303,"text":"Now, we're going to just talk about dealing with lots of variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67304,"text":"And rates of change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67305,"text":"So, essentially, we're going to talk about the same type of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67306,"text":"So, I'm going to tell you about a subject which is called related rates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67307,"text":"Which is really just another excuse for getting used to setting up variables and equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67308,"text":"So, here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67309,"text":"Related rates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67311,"text":"So here's my example for today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67312,"text":"So, again, this is going to be a police problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67313,"text":"But this is going to be a word problem and - sorry, I'm don't want to scare you, no police.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67314,"text":"Well, there are police in the story but they're not present.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67315,"text":"So, but I'm going to draw it immediately with the diagram because I'm going to save us the trouble.","entities":[{"id":85748,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67316,"text":"Although, you know, the point here is to get from the words to the diagram.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67318,"text":"And here's the road.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67319,"text":"And you're coming along, here, in your, let's see, in your car going in this direction here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67320,"text":"And the police have radar.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67321,"text":"Which is bouncing off of your car.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67322,"text":"And what they read off is that you're <EXPRESSION> feet away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67324,"text":"Now, the question is, are you speeding.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67325,"text":"That's the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67327,"text":"So that's the threshold here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67328,"text":"So what I want to do now is show you how you set up a problem like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67329,"text":"This distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67330,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, and because it's the distance to a straight line you know that this is a right angle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67331,"text":"So we know that this is a right triangle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67333,"text":"So now, the question is, how do we put the letters in to make his problem work, to figure out what the rate of change is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67334,"text":"So now, let me explain that right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67335,"text":"And we will actually do the computation next time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67336,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> thing is, you have to understand what's changing and what's not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67338,"text":"And now, an important distance here is the distance to this foot of this perpendicular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67339,"text":"So I'm going to name that <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67340,"text":"I'm going to give that letter <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67341,"text":"Now, <EXPRESSION> is varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67342,"text":"The reason why I need a letter for it as opposed to this <EXPRESSION> is that it's going to have a rate of change with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67343,"text":"And, in fact, it's related to, the question is whether <EXPRESSION> is faster or slower than <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67344,"text":"So that's the thing that's varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67345,"text":"Now, there's something else that's varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67346,"text":"This distance here is also varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67347,"text":"So we need a letter for that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67348,"text":"We do not need a letter for this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67349,"text":"Because it's never changing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67350,"text":"We're assuming the police are parked.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67351,"text":"They're not ready to roar out and catch you just yet, and they're certainly not in motion when they've got the radar guns aimed at you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67352,"text":"So you need to know something about the sociology and style of police.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67353,"text":"So you need to know things about the real world.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67355,"text":"So this is how fast you're approaching.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67356,"text":"Now, that's measured along the radar gun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67357,"text":"I claim that that's d by dt of this quantity here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67358,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION> is also changing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67359,"text":"That's why we needed a letter for it, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67360,"text":"So, next time, we'll just put that all together and compute <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67361,"text":"<EXPRESSION> correction from last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67362,"text":"Sorry to say, I forgot a very important factor when I was telling you what an average value is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67363,"text":"If you don't put in that factor, it's only half off on the exam problem that will be given on this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67364,"text":"So I would have gotten half off for missing out on this factor, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67367,"text":"This was meant to illustrate this idea that we're dividing by the total here.","entities":[{"id":85758,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67368,"text":"And we are going to be talking about average value in more detail.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67369,"text":"Not today, though.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67370,"text":"So this has to do with average value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67371,"text":"And we'll discuss it in considerable detail in a couple of days, I guess.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67372,"text":"Now, today I want to continue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67374,"text":"And anyway it's very important to write it down on the board twice, because you want to see it at least twice.","entities":[{"id":85759,"label":"command","start_offset":34,"end_offset":39}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67375,"text":"And many more times as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67377,"text":"It says that the derivative of an integral gives you the function back again.","entities":[{"id":85761,"label":"method","start_offset":17,"end_offset":27},{"id":85762,"label":"method","start_offset":34,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67378,"text":"So here's the theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67380,"text":"But we didn't get into it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67381,"text":"And this is something that's on your problem set along with several other examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67493,"text":"And so this suggests that we write down <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":85811,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67494,"text":"That's going to be our trick.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67497,"text":"And <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67498,"text":"So I've now substituted in for the integrand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67499,"text":"But on top of this, with definite integrals, we also have to check the limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67500,"text":"And the limits work out as follows.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67501,"text":"When <EQUATION>, that's the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67502,"text":"Let's just take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67504,"text":"So that means that <EXPRESSION> =, what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67505,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67506,"text":"Because <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67507,"text":"So if <EQUATION>, this is if and only if.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67508,"text":"So this lower limit, which really in disguise was where <EQUATION>, becomes where <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67509,"text":"And similarly, when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67510,"text":"So the upper limit here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67511,"text":"And now, if you notice, we're just going to cancel these <EXPRESSION> factors here.","entities":[{"id":85813,"label":"command","start_offset":44,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67512,"text":"And now we recognize that this is just the same as the definition of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67513,"text":"Because <EXPRESSION> is over here in the box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67515,"text":"So this is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67516,"text":"Which is what we wanted to show.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67518,"text":"Now, the last example, that I'm going to discuss of this type, I already mentioned last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67521,"text":"It really is not any function that you can express in terms of the functions that we know already.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67522,"text":"And the approach, always, to these new functions is to think of what their properties are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67523,"text":"And the way we think of functions in order to understand them is to maybe sketch them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67524,"text":"And so I'm going to do exactly the same thing I did over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67525,"text":"So, what is it that I can get out of this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67526,"text":"Well, immediately I can figure out what the derivative is.","entities":[{"id":85815,"label":"method","start_offset":44,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67527,"text":"I read it off from the fundamental theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67528,"text":"It's this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67529,"text":"I also can figure out the value at the starting place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67530,"text":"In this case, the starting place is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67531,"text":"And the value is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67532,"text":"And I should check the <EXPRESSION> derivative, which is also not so difficult to compute.","entities":[{"id":85816,"label":"method","start_offset":36,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67534,"text":"And so now I can see that this function is increasing, because this derivative is positive, it's always increasing.","entities":[{"id":85818,"label":"method","start_offset":68,"end_offset":78}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67535,"text":"And it's going to be concave down when <EXPRESSION> is positive and concave up when <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67536,"text":"Because there's a minus sign here, so the sign is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67537,"text":"This is less than <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is positive and greater than <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67538,"text":"And maybe to get started I'll remind you <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67539,"text":"It's also true that <EXPRESSION>, that just comes right out of this, <EQUATION> which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67540,"text":"That means the tangent line again has slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67541,"text":"We do this a lot with functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67542,"text":"We normalize them so that their slopes of their tangent lines are <EXPRESSION> at convenient spots.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67543,"text":"So here's the tangent line of slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67544,"text":"We know this thing is concave down to the right and concave up to the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67545,"text":"And so it's going to look something like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67546,"text":"With an inflection point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67547,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67549,"text":"Really, you want to know this graph as well as possible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67550,"text":"And so there are just a couple more features.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67552,"text":"and that is the property that turns out that this function is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67553,"text":"Namely, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67554,"text":"That's what's known as an odd function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67555,"text":"Now, the reason why it's odd is that it's the antiderivative of something that's even.","entities":[{"id":85825,"label":"method","start_offset":46,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67556,"text":"This function in here is even.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67557,"text":"And we nailed it down so that it was <EXPRESSION> at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67558,"text":"Another way of interpreting that, and let me show it to you underneath, is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67559,"text":"When we look at its derivative, its derivative, course, is the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85826,"label":"method","start_offset":20,"end_offset":30},{"id":85827,"label":"method","start_offset":36,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67560,"text":"Sorry, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67561,"text":"So that's this shape here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67562,"text":"And you can see the slope is <EXPRESSION>, but fairly close to <EXPRESSION>, but positive along here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67563,"text":"It's getting, this is its steepest point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67564,"text":"This is the highest point here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67565,"text":"And then it's leveling off again; the slope is going down, always positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67567,"text":"Now, the interpretation of the function that's up above is that the value here is the area from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67568,"text":"So this is area <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67569,"text":"Maybe I'll color it in, decorate it a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67570,"text":"So this area here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67571,"text":"Now, I want to show you this odd property, by using this symmetry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67573,"text":"But now there's a reversal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67574,"text":"Because we're keeping track of the area starting from <EXPRESSION> going forward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67575,"text":"That's positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67576,"text":"If we go backwards, it's counted negatively.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67577,"text":"So if we went backwards to - <EXPRESSION>, we'd get exactly the same as that green patch over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67578,"text":"We'd get a red patch over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67579,"text":"But it would be counted negatively.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67580,"text":"And that's the property that it's odd.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67581,"text":"You can also check this by properties of integrals directly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67582,"text":"That would be just like this process here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67583,"text":"So it's completely analogous to checking this formula over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67584,"text":"So that's <EXPRESSION> of the comments I wanted to make about this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67585,"text":"And why does this save us a lot of time, if we know this is odd?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67586,"text":"Well, we know that the shape of this branch is exactly the reverse, or the reflection, if you like, of the shape of this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67587,"text":"What we want to do is flip it under the axis and then reflect it over that way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67588,"text":"And that's the symmetry property of the graph of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85831,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67589,"text":"Now, the last property that I want to mention is what's happening with the ends.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67590,"text":"And at the end there's an asymptote, there's a limit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67591,"text":"So this is an asymptote.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67592,"text":"And the same thing down here, which will be exactly because of the odd feature, this'll be exactly negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67598,"text":"So, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67601,"text":"Well, maybe not all of you, you're just afraid to say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67602,"text":"So it's obvious.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67605,"text":"Ah, yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67606,"text":"Right, so this is actually very un-obvious, but it's a very important quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67607,"text":"And it's an amazing fact that this thing approaches this number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67608,"text":"And it's something that people worried about for many years before actually nailing down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67609,"text":"And so what I just claimed here is that the limit as <EXPRESSION> approaches <EXPRESSION> of <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67610,"text":"And similarly, if you do it to <EXPRESSION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67612,"text":"This function is <EXPRESSION>, short for error function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67633,"text":"But it's a hard problem, and already a century ago the prime number theorem, which established this connection was extremely important to progress in math.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67634,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67635,"text":"Is this stuff you're supposed to understand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67638,"text":"The answer is, this is, so we launched off into something here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67639,"text":"And let me just explain it to you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67640,"text":"I'm going to be talking a fair amount more about this particular function, because it's associated to the normal distribution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67669,"text":"I'm going to change years now, I'm going to shift gears.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67670,"text":"And we're going to go back to a more standard thing which has to do with just setting up integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67671,"text":"And this has to do with understanding where integrals play a role, and they play a role in cumulative sums, in evaluating things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67672,"text":"This is much more closely associated with the <EXPRESSION> Fundamental Theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67673,"text":"That is, we'll take, today we were talking about how integrals are formulas for functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67675,"text":"We're going to go back and talk about integrals as being the answer to a question as opposed to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67677,"text":"So in other words, and the <EXPRESSION> example, or most of the examples for now, are going to be taken from geometry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67678,"text":"Later on we'll get to probability.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67679,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> topic is just areas between curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67680,"text":"Here's the idea.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67682,"text":"And take a chunk that looks like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67683,"text":"And I'm going to write the thickness of that chunk.","entities":[{"id":85854,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67684,"text":"Well, let's give these things names.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67687,"text":"That's the thickness.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67688,"text":"And what is the height?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67689,"text":"Well, the height is the difference between the top value and the bottom value.","entities":[{"id":85855,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67690,"text":"So here we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67691,"text":"This is, if you like, base times - whoops, backwards.","entities":[{"id":85856,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67692,"text":"This is height, and this is the base of the rectangle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67693,"text":"And these are approximately correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67694,"text":"But of course, only in limit when this is an infinitesimal, is it exactly right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67695,"text":"In order to get the whole area, I have add these guys up.","entities":[{"id":85859,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67696,"text":"So I'm going to integrate from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85860,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67697,"text":"That's summing them, that's adding them up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67698,"text":"And that's going to be my <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67699,"text":"So that's the story here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67700,"text":"Now, let me just say <EXPRESSION> things about this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67701,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, on a very abstract level before we get started with details of more complicated problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67704,"text":"That's called an integrand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67705,"text":"And I want to identify what are known as the limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67706,"text":"The whole game is simply to figure out what <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and this quantity is here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67707,"text":"Whatever it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67708,"text":"And the minute we have that, we can calculate the integral if we like.","entities":[{"id":85864,"label":"method","start_offset":50,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67712,"text":"The <EXPRESSION>, the <EXPRESSION>, and what we're integrating.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67713,"text":"If you leave <EXPRESSION> of these out, it's like the following thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67714,"text":"I ask you what the area of this region is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67715,"text":"If I left out this end, how could I possibly know?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67716,"text":"I don't even know where it starts, so how can I figure out what this area is if I haven't identified what the left side is.","entities":[{"id":85870,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":110,"end_offset":119}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67717,"text":"I can't leave out the bottom.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67718,"text":"It's sitting here, in this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67719,"text":"Because I need to know where it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67720,"text":"And I need to know the top and I need to know this side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67722,"text":"If I don't incorporate them into the information, I'll never get anything out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67723,"text":"So I need to know everything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67724,"text":"And I need to know exactly those things, in order to have a formula for the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67725,"text":"Now, when this gets carried out in practice, as we will do now in our <EXPRESSION> example, it's more complicated than it looks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67727,"text":"This is our <EXPRESSION> example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67728,"text":"Let me make sure that I chose the example that I wanted to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67729,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67730,"text":"Now, there's a <EXPRESSION> step in figuring these things out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67731,"text":"And this is that you must draw a picture.","entities":[{"id":85872,"label":"command","start_offset":26,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67732,"text":"If you don't draw a picture you'll never figure out what this area is, because you'll never figure out what's what between these curves.","entities":[{"id":85873,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67733,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> curve, <EQUATION>, is a parabola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67734,"text":"But <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67735,"text":"It's pointing this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67736,"text":"So it's this parabola here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67737,"text":"That's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67738,"text":"Whoops, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67740,"text":"It goes through this place here, which is <EXPRESSION> over and has slope <EXPRESSION>, so it does this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67741,"text":"And this shape in here is what we mean by the area between the curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67742,"text":"Now that we see what it is, we have a better idea of what our goal is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67743,"text":"If you haven't drawn it, you have no hope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67744,"text":"Now, I'm going to describe <EXPRESSION> ways of getting at this area here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67745,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is motivated by the shape that I just described right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67747,"text":"I'm going to chop things up into these vertical pieces just as I did right there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67748,"text":"Now, here's the difficulty with that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67749,"text":"The difficulty is that the upper curve here has <EXPRESSION> formula but the lower curve shifts from being a part of the parabola to being a part of the straight line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67750,"text":"That means that there are <EXPRESSION> different formulas for the lower function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67751,"text":"And the only way to accommodate that is to separate this up into <EXPRESSION> halves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67752,"text":"Separate it out into <EXPRESSION> halves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67753,"text":"I'm going to have to divide it right here.","entities":[{"id":85877,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67756,"text":"We'll also have to be sure to distinguish between the top branch and the bottom branch of the parabola, which we're about to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67758,"text":"And so we will do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67760,"text":"That's the top part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67761,"text":"I'll call it top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67763,"text":"They are pink, and I guess this is blue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67764,"text":"Alright, so now let's see what's happening.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67766,"text":"Well, really I'm going to have to figure out <EXPRESSION> points, I claim.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67767,"text":"I'm going to have to figure out where this point is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67768,"text":"Where this point is, and where that point is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67770,"text":"Another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67771,"text":"Could you speak up?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67772,"text":"The question is, why do we need to split up the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67773,"text":"And I think in order to answer that question further, I'm going to have to go into the details of the method, and then you'll see where it's necessary.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67774,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> step is that I'm going to figure out what these <EXPRESSION> points are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67775,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> is kind of easy; it's the point (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67777,"text":"I can identify them by the following equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67778,"text":"I need to see where these curves intersect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67779,"text":"At what, well, if I plug in <EQUATION>, I get <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67780,"text":"And then I can solve this quadratic equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67781,"text":"<EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67782,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67783,"text":"And this is telling me that <EQUATION> or <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67784,"text":"So I've found <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67785,"text":"That means this point down here has <EXPRESSION> entry <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67787,"text":"I have to square, this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":85880,"label":"method","start_offset":10,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67788,"text":"So that's the formula for this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67789,"text":"And the other point has <EXPRESSION> entry <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67790,"text":"And, again, with his formula <EQUATION>, I have to <EXPRESSION> to get <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67791,"text":"Now, I claim I have enough data to get started.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67794,"text":"The top is the formula for this branch of <EQUATION>, which is in the positive <EXPRESSION> region.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67795,"text":"And that is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67796,"text":"The bottom curve, part of the parabola, so this is the bottom left, is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67797,"text":"That's the other branch of the square root.","entities":[{"id":85886,"label":"method","start_offset":31,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67798,"text":"And this is exactly what you were asking before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67799,"text":"And this is, we have to distinguish between these <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67800,"text":"And the point is, these formulas really are different.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67801,"text":"They're not the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67802,"text":"Now, the last bit is the bottom right chunk here, which is this pink part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67805,"text":"And that's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67806,"text":"Now I'm ready to find the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67810,"text":"I need to figure out what the range of <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67811,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> I'm going to - well, let's leave ourselves a little more room than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67812,"text":"Just to be safe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67813,"text":"OK, here's the right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67814,"text":"So here we have our <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67815,"text":"Now, I need to figure out the starting place and the ending place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67816,"text":"So the starting place is the leftmost place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67860,"text":"Now, the dimensions have different names.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67861,"text":"But the principle is similar.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67862,"text":"The width, we now call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67863,"text":"Because it's the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67864,"text":"And this distance here, from the left end to the right end, we have to figure out what the formulas for those things are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67868,"text":"So here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67870,"text":"Is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67872,"text":"And now in order to use this, it's going to turn out that we want to write <EXPRESSION> as, we want to reverse roles.","entities":[{"id":85916,"label":"command","start_offset":69,"end_offset":74}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67879,"text":"This is the lowest value of <EXPRESSION>, and this is the top value of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67881,"text":"The lowest level of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67897,"text":"Which is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67899,"text":"So that means that <EXPRESSION> is positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67907,"text":"And when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67908,"text":"And that's not an accident, that's exactly the geometry of the shape that we picked out there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67909,"text":"So this is the technique.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67910,"text":"Now, this is a much more routine integral.","entities":[{"id":85939,"label":"method","start_offset":33,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67926,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, as time goes forward, we see this bump beginning to appear.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67928,"text":"So I guess I'm thinking about sort of further questions, because every time you do a numerical experiment, good additional question show up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67930,"text":"Ultimately it'd be great to be able to predict what it would be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67931,"text":"In particular, does that bump reach a certain height?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67932,"text":"Because you can see it just barely forming and then you see it growing to a certain point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67934,"text":"That would be, does it approach a steady profile?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67935,"text":"Does that height settle down?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67936,"text":"It'd be fantastic to be able to predict that height.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67937,"text":"For example, you always want to know, how do things depend on the parameter?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67938,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> parameter we have in this problem is <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67946,"text":"I don't know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67950,"text":"So it would be on that kind of a staggered grid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67952,"text":"So leapfrog you'd think of it right away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67954,"text":"So you see right away, the <EXPRESSION>'s cancel.","entities":[{"id":85945,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67955,"text":"The delta <EXPRESSION> the <EXPRESSION> is our old ratio <EXPRESSION>, so this is easily written in terms of <EXPRESSION> again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67960,"text":"Let me just emphasize, what's the goal?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67961,"text":"When I say that this upwind <EXPRESSION> is smeared out, I mean that it doesn't satisfy what you really hope for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68038,"text":"These are <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68040,"text":"So this says, figure out the space differences so this, this minus this and this minus this and then take the time difference of those.","entities":[{"id":85947,"label":"command","start_offset":61,"end_offset":66},{"id":85948,"label":"command","start_offset":81,"end_offset":86},{"id":85949,"label":"command","start_offset":101,"end_offset":105},{"id":85950,"label":"method","start_offset":115,"end_offset":125}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68041,"text":"Can I see what I'll get if I do that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68077,"text":"Maybe important to say what's coming up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68081,"text":"Specifically, the Black-Scholes equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68083,"text":"So this is an application that we wouldn't have made some years ago, but now it's worth focusing on that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68084,"text":"I think it's interesting in itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68086,"text":"So nonlinear wave equations and those are called conservation laws.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68087,"text":"That's after these linear cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68088,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68089,"text":"So I'm ready to tackle the heat equation, starting then on to the next section of the notes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68090,"text":"So let me tackle it here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68091,"text":"So the heat equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68093,"text":"Because we already see the big difference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68094,"text":"Now, there's a <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>, but only a <EXPRESSION> derivative in time.","entities":[{"id":85969,"label":"method","start_offset":66,"end_offset":76}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68098,"text":"So when <EXPRESSION> is constrained by <EXPRESSION>, we're looking at small time steps.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68099,"text":"We're looking at stiff systems, absolutely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68101,"text":"In fact, why don't we see it right away, starting as always with exponentials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68102,"text":"So if I plug in <EXPRESSION> and <EQUATION>, separating variables as always.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68172,"text":"There aren't characteristics here, but this is an extremely important solution, and I think you could call it the fundamental solution to the heat equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68174,"text":"You may have seen this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68184,"text":"And the question is, can I do it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68185,"text":"And the answer turns out to be yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68186,"text":"You can do that integral when this is a constant and that will give you the answer with that starting value.","entities":[{"id":86004,"label":"method","start_offset":16,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68187,"text":"Let me just say what that answer is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68190,"text":"Here's the key part of the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68191,"text":"It's a solution which starts from a <EXPRESSION>, spreads of course, and the shape as it spreads is a bell.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68193,"text":"And then, always here comes that scalar tells us the width of the bell.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68194,"text":"How far has it spread at <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68195,"text":"And what goes there is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68241,"text":"where there's a heat component that goes into the system, and there's a work component.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68255,"text":"Rather than <EXPRESSION>, we would get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":86008,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68256,"text":"And clearly, for this <EXPRESSION>, the natural variables are <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68257,"text":"And there were other types of these functions that we construct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68259,"text":"And by taking various derivatives of equilibrium functions with respect to each other, we can express other ones.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68260,"text":"And via this methodology, we can relate to many different things to each other and have mathematical relations between physical observables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68261,"text":"So following up on that, we then ask what are some other mathematical forms that we can look at.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68264,"text":"And importantly, that told us that the intensive variables were not independent of each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68265,"text":"And you had relationship that you <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68267,"text":"And that was for a gas isotherm.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68269,"text":"And the analogue of hydrostatic work for a gas was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68270,"text":"So this becomes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68271,"text":"If you have <EXPRESSION> component, it goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68272,"text":"And we said that this gives us the relationship along an isotherm.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68274,"text":"I'll come back to that shortly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68277,"text":"So let's start with our initial equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68278,"text":"And for simplicity, let's think of cases where we have a fixed number of particles so that we can write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":86009,"label":"command","start_offset":98,"end_offset":103}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68279,"text":"So this looks like this dF that I wrote before for you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68285,"text":"So I have <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68309,"text":"And you can go and construct anything else that you like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68326,"text":"This becomes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68328,"text":"So that's my Maxwell relation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68333,"text":"Yes, this is valid for extensive system.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68334,"text":"I used extensively in the relation of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68335,"text":"And here, I never used extensivity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68336,"text":"But if I have a system that I tell you its pressure and temperature, how is its volume related to the number of particles?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68341,"text":"Any questions?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68342,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68343,"text":"What about the constraint of constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68344,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68345,"text":"Actually, constraint of constant <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is important because we said that said there it is a kind of Gibbs-Duhem relation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68347,"text":"And that constraint is the <EXPRESSION> that tells me that once you have set <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which are the <EXPRESSION> variables that I have specified here, you also know m<EXPRESSION>u.","entities":[{"id":86024,"label":"command","start_offset":73,"end_offset":76}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68348,"text":"That is, you know all the intensive quantities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68350,"text":"And that's what's the condition that I used over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68351,"text":"But it is only so let me re-emphasize it this way I will write <EXPRESSION> is the same thing as <EXPRESSION>, only if I have <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[{"id":86025,"label":"command","start_offset":57,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68353,"text":"I was going to build this equation to say, look at the elements of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68355,"text":"And in particular, we had that for the certain changes that I won't repeat, the change in entropy to be positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68356,"text":"So when you are in equilibrium, you have this relationship between equilibrium state functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68358,"text":"So the next item that we are going to look at is, what are the consequences of having underlying this equality between functions of state some kind of an inequality about certain things being possible and things not being possible?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68359,"text":"And that relates to stability conditions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68360,"text":"And I find it easier to again introduce to you these stability conditions by thinking of a mechanical analogue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68364,"text":"Now, we also discussed last time what happens if I were to pull on this with some force <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68365,"text":"So I pull on this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68367,"text":"So if I were to make it in the vertical direction, you can imagine this as being the potential energy of the mass that was pulling on the spring.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68369,"text":"Once essentially the kinetic energy has disappeared, my spring stops oscillating and goes to a particular value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68370,"text":"And mathematically, that corresponds to subtracting a linear function from this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68371,"text":"Actually, what will it look like?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68372,"text":"Let's not make this go flat, but go up in some linear fashion so that at least I can draw something like this.","entities":[{"id":86030,"label":"command","start_offset":85,"end_offset":89}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68373,"text":"So what I need to do is to minimize this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68375,"text":"But especially if you have a spring that has the kind of potential that I drew for you, you start increasing the so basically, what it says is that you end up at the place where the slope is = the derivative of the potential function.","entities":[{"id":86031,"label":"method","start_offset":197,"end_offset":207}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68376,"text":"What happens if you start increasing this slope, if it is a non-linear type of thing, at some point you can see it's impossible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68377,"text":"Essentially, it's like a very flat noodle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68384,"text":"It only depends on the potential energy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68389,"text":"So there is this convexity condition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68392,"text":"So you will have the potential energy as a function of many variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68394,"text":"This matrix is positive definite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68400,"text":"This is just <EXPRESSION> component that I have been focusing on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68401,"text":"And so ultimately, I'm going to try to generalize that to this form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68402,"text":"But <EXPRESSION> thing that I don't quite like in this form is that I'm focusing too much on the displacements.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68403,"text":"This is written appropriately using this form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68405,"text":"So I'm going to do a slight manipulation of this to make that symmetry between forces and displacements apparent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68408,"text":"They're related by this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68409,"text":"Now, if I were to make a change in <EXPRESSION>, there will be a change in the position of the equilibrium.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68412,"text":"So what I'm saying is that this is a condition that relates the position to the forces.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68413,"text":"If I make a slight change in the force, there will be a corresponding slight change in the position.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68414,"text":"And the changes in the position and the force given by this equilibrium condition are related by this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68421,"text":"And I have that in the notes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68422,"text":"It is somewhat more mathematically complicated than this, because the derivatives involve additional factors of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68423,"text":"And you have to do slightly more work, but you will ultimately come with the same expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68424,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68425,"text":"You say, why is that of any use?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68426,"text":"It is possible that you've already seen a particular use of this expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68429,"text":"Let's even be simpler.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68430,"text":"Look at the case where <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EQUATION>, which means that I have a fixed amount of gas at a particular temperature.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68431,"text":"So I could have, for example, a box in this room which is in equilibrium at the same temperature as the temperature of the room.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68432,"text":"But its volume I'm allowed to adjust so that the pressure changes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68433,"text":"So in that process, at a particular temperature, I will be finding a particular curve in the pressure volume space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68436,"text":"This has to be a decreasing function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68438,"text":"So this is a curve where <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68439,"text":"Fine, you say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68440,"text":"Nothing surprising about that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68441,"text":"Well, it turns out that if you cool the gas, the shape of this isotherm can change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68442,"text":"It can get started.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68443,"text":"And there is a critical isotherm at which you see a condition such as this, where there's a point where the curve comes with <EXPRESSION> slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68444,"text":"So you say that for that particular critical isotherm occurring at <EXPRESSION>, if I were to make this expansion, the <EXPRESSION> term in this expansion is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68445,"text":"You say, OK, let's continue and write down the <EXPRESSION> term <EXPRESSION> at constant <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":86047,"label":"command","start_offset":32,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68446,"text":"Now the problem is that if I multiply this by <EXPRESSION> which would have made this into <EXPRESSION> I have a problem because delta V can be both positive or negative.","entities":[{"id":86048,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68447,"text":"I can go <EXPRESSION> direction or the other direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68448,"text":"And a term that is a cubic can change sign can sometimes be positive, can sometimes be negative, depending on the sign of that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68449,"text":"And that is disallowed by this condition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68456,"text":"And you say, OK, exactly what have you done here?","entities":[{"id":86049,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":11}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68457,"text":"What you have done here is you've drawn a curve that locally looks like a cubic with the appropriate sign.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68459,"text":"And you probably have used this for calculating critical points of van der Waals and other gases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68460,"text":"And we will do that ourselves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68465,"text":"That statement, in order to fully understand and appreciate, you have to come to next term, where we talk about phase transitions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68475,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68476,"text":"Essentially, this stability condition tells you a lot of things about signs of response functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68478,"text":"It wants to be contracted.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68479,"text":"And similarly here, you are essentially compressing the gas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68502,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68547,"text":"And then what I have is that the whole thing is proportional to delta T squared and some coefficient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68549,"text":"So entropy should always be an increasing function of temperature at constant displacement.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
