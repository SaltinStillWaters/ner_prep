{"id": 8525, "text": "wait ill explain", "entities": []}
{"id": 8526, "text": "so suppose i stuck in a minus sign here", "entities": []}
{"id": 8527, "text": "i would have gotten this with the difference so with an extra minus sign", "entities": []}

{"id": 8618, "text": "now so let me just make two points about this which are just philosophical points for you right now", "entities": []}
{"id": 8619, "text": "the first is when i promised you at the beginning of this class that we were going to be able to differentiate any function you know i meant it very literally", "entities": []}
{"id": 8620, "text": "what i meant is if you know the function well be able give a formula for the derivative", "entities": []}
{"id": 8621, "text": "if you dont know how to find a function youll have a lot of trouble finding the derivative", "entities": []}
{"id": 8622, "text": "so we didnt make any promises that if you cant find the function you will be able to find the derivative by some magic", "entities": []}
{"id": 8623, "text": "that will never happen", "entities": []}
{"id": 8624, "text": "and however complex the function is a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients were stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 8625, "text": "but the big advantage of his method notice is that although weve had to find star we had to find this formula star and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically by the way which well learn later so theres a good method for doing it numerically", "entities": []}
{"id": 8626, "text": "although we had to find star we never had to differentiate it", "entities": []}
{"id": 8627, "text": "we had a fast way of getting the slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 8628, "text": "so we had to know what <expression> and <expression> were", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"id": 8629, "text": "but <expression> we got by an algebraic formula in terms of the values here", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 8630, "text": "so this is very fast forgetting the slope once you know the point", "entities": []}
{"id": 8631, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 8632, "text": "student whats in the parentheses", "entities": []}
{"id": 8633, "text": "professor sorry this is well lets see if i can manage this", "entities": []}
{"id": 8634, "text": "is this the parentheses youre talking about", "entities": []}
{"id": 8635, "text": "ah say", "entities": []}
{"id": 8636, "text": "that says say", "entities": []}
{"id": 8637, "text": "well so maybe i should put commas around it", "entities": []}
{"id": 8638, "text": "but it was s a y comma comma okay", "entities": []}
{"id": 8639, "text": "well here was at <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"id": 8640, "text": "im just throwing out a value", "entities": []}
{"id": 8641, "text": "any other value", "entities": []}
{"id": 8642, "text": "actually there is one value my favorite value", "entities": []}
{"id": 8643, "text": "well this is easy to evaluate right", "entities": []}
{"id": 8644, "text": "<expression> i can do it there", "entities": []}
{"id": 8645, "text": "thats maybe the only one", "entities": []}
{"id": 8646, "text": "the others are a nuisance", "entities": []}
{"id": 8647, "text": "all right other questions", "entities": []}
{"id": 8648, "text": "now we have to do something more here", "entities": []}
{"id": 8649, "text": "so i claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know", "entities": []}
{"id": 8650, "text": "but really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at", "entities": []}
{"id": 8651, "text": "so this implicit differentiation method has one very very important application to finding inverse functions or finding derivatives of inverse functions", "entities": []}
{"id": 8652, "text": "so lets talk about that next", "entities": []}
{"id": 8653, "text": "so first maybe well just illustrate by an example", "entities": []}
{"id": 8654, "text": "if you have the function <expression> for <expression> positive then of course this idea is that we should simplify this equation and we should square it so we get this somewhat simpler equation here", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 115}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 129}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 150}]}

{"id": 8874, "text": "01", "entities": []}
{"id": 8875, "text": "were getting started today with what were calling unit one a highly imaginative title", "entities": []}
{"id": 8876, "text": "and its differentiation", "entities": []}
{"id": 8877, "text": "so let me first tell you briefly whats in store in the next couple of weeks", "entities": []}
{"id": 8878, "text": "the main topic today is what is a derivative", "entities": []}
{"id": 8879, "text": "and were going to look at this from several different points of view and the first one is the geometric interpretation", "entities": []}
{"id": 8880, "text": "thats what well spend most of today on", "entities": []}
{"id": 8881, "text": "and then well also talk about a physical interpretation of what a derivative is", "entities": []}
{"id": 8882, "text": "and then theres going to be something else which i guess is maybe the reason why calculus is so fundamental and why we always start with it in most science and engineering schools which is the importance of derivatives of this to all measurements", "entities": []}
{"id": 8883, "text": "so that means pretty much every place", "entities": []}
{"id": 8884, "text": "that means in science in engineering in economics in political science etc", "entities": []}
{"id": 8885, "text": "polling lots of commercial applications just about everything", "entities": []}
{"id": 8886, "text": "now thats what well be getting started with and then theres another thing that were gonna do in this unit which is were going to explain how to differentiate anything", "entities": []}
{"id": 8887, "text": "so how to differentiate any function you know", "entities": []}
{"id": 8888, "text": "and thats kind of a tall order but let me just give you an example", "entities": []}
{"id": 8889, "text": "if you want to take the derivative  this well see today is the notation for the derivative of something  of some messy function like <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 133, "end_offset": 145}]}

{"id": 8893, "text": "all right so thats what were gonna do and today as i said were gonna spend most of our time on this geometric interpretation", "entities": []}
{"id": 8894, "text": "so lets begin with that", "entities": []}
{"id": 8895, "text": "so here we go with the geometric interpretation of derivatives", "entities": []}
{"id": 8896, "text": "and what were going to do is just ask the geometric problem of finding the tangent line to some graph of some function at some point", "entities": []}

{"id": 8909, "text": "how about red", "entities": []}
{"id": 8910, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 8911, "text": "so here it is", "entities": []}
{"id": 8912, "text": "theres the tangent line well not quite straight", "entities": []}
{"id": 8913, "text": "close enough", "entities": []}
{"id": 8914, "text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 8915, "text": "i did it", "entities": []}
{"id": 8916, "text": "thats the geometric problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 8917, "text": "i achieved what i wanted to do and its kind of an interesting question which unfortunately i cant solve for you in this class which is how did i do that", "entities": []}
{"id": 8918, "text": "that is how physically did i manage to know what to do to draw this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8919, "text": "but thats what geometric problems are like", "entities": []}
{"id": 8920, "text": "we visualize it", "entities": []}
{"id": 8921, "text": "we can figure it out somewhere in our brains", "entities": []}
{"id": 8922, "text": "it happens", "entities": []}
{"id": 8923, "text": "and the task that we have now is to figure out how to do it analytically to do it in a way that a machine could just as well as i did in drawing this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8924, "text": "so what did we learn in high school about what a tangent line is", "entities": []}
{"id": 8925, "text": "well a tangent line has an equation and any line through a point has the equation <equation> the slope times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 91}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"id": 8926, "text": "so heres the equation for that line and now there are two pieces of information that were going to need to work out what the line is", "entities": []}
{"id": 8927, "text": "the first one is the point", "entities": []}
{"id": 8928, "text": "thats that point <expression> there", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"id": 8929, "text": "and to specify <expression> given <expression> we need to know the level of <expression> which is of course just <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 88}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 113, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"id": 8930, "text": "thats not a calculus problem but anyway thats a very important part of the process", "entities": []}
{"id": 8931, "text": "so thats the first thing we need to know", "entities": []}
{"id": 8932, "text": "and the second thing we need to know is the slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 8933, "text": "and thats this number <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 8934, "text": "and in calculus we have another name for it", "entities": []}
{"id": 8935, "text": "we call it <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}

{"id": 8937, "text": "so thats the calculus part", "entities": []}
{"id": 8938, "text": "thats the tricky part and thats the part that we have to discuss now", "entities": []}
{"id": 8939, "text": "so just to make that explicit here im going to make a definition which is that <expression>  which is known as the derivative of <expression> at <expression> is the slope of the tangent line to <equation> at the point lets just call it <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 91}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 129, "end_offset": 140}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 145, "end_offset": 157}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 193, "end_offset": 204}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 236, "end_offset": 248}]}
{"id": 8940, "text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 8941, "text": "so thats what it is but still i havent made any progress in figuring out any better how i drew that line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8942, "text": "so i have to say something thats more concrete because i want to be able to cook up what these numbers are", "entities": []}
{"id": 8943, "text": "i have to figure out what this number <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"id": 8944, "text": "and one way of thinking about that let me just try this so i certainly am taking for granted that in sort of noncalculus part that i know what a line through a point is", "entities": []}
{"id": 8945, "text": "so i know this equation", "entities": []}
{"id": 8946, "text": "but another possibility might be this line here how do i know  well unfortunately i didnt draw it quite straight but there it is  how do i know that this orange line is not a tangent line but this other line is a tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8947, "text": "well its actually not so obvious but im gonna describe it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"id": 8948, "text": "its not really the fact this thing crosses at some other place which is this point <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"id": 8949, "text": "but its not really the fact that the thing crosses at two place because the line could be wiggly the curve could be wiggly and it could cross back and forth a number of times", "entities": []}
{"id": 8950, "text": "thats not what distinguishes the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8951, "text": "so im gonna have to somehow grasp this and ill first do it in language", "entities": []}
{"id": 8952, "text": "and its the following idea its that if you take this orange line which is called a secant line and you think of the point <expression> as getting closer and closer to <expression> then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 134}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 167, "end_offset": 179}]}
{"id": 8953, "text": "and if we draw it close enough then thats gonna be the correct line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8954, "text": "so thats really what i did sort of in my brain when i drew that first line", "entities": []}
{"id": 8955, "text": "and so thats the way im going to articulate it first", "entities": []}
{"id": 8956, "text": "now so the tangent line is  the limit of so called secant lines <expression> as <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 76}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 92}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 114}]}
{"id": 8957, "text": "and here were thinking of p as being fixed and <expression> as variable", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"id": 8958, "text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 8959, "text": "again this is still the geometric discussion but now were gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation", "entities": []}
{"id": 8960, "text": "and well be able to work out formulas in any example", "entities": []}
{"id": 8961, "text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"id": 8962, "text": "so first of all im gonna write out these points <expression> and <expression> again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}

{"id": 8964, "text": "and im thinking of this line through them", "entities": []}
{"id": 8965, "text": "i guess it was orange so well leave it as orange", "entities": []}
{"id": 8966, "text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 8967, "text": "and now i want to compute its slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 8968, "text": "so this gradually well do this in two steps", "entities": []}
{"id": 8969, "text": "and these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus including multivariable calculus across the board", "entities": []}
{"id": 8970, "text": "so the first notation thats used is you imagine heres the xaxis underneath and heres the <expression> the location directly below the point <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 101}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 140, "end_offset": 152}]}

{"id": 8975, "text": "and the other thing is this height", "entities": []}
{"id": 8976, "text": "so thats this distance here which we denote <expression> which is the change in <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 43}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"id": 8977, "text": "and then the slope is just the ratio <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"id": 8978, "text": "so this is the slope of the secant", "entities": []}
{"id": 8979, "text": "and the process i just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself but also in particular to its slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 8980, "text": "and the way we write that is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 75}]}

{"id": 9016, "text": "and by the way this has a name", "entities": []}

{"id": 9021, "text": "so lets just take a look", "entities": []}

{"id": 9024, "text": "", "entities": []}
{"id": 9025, "text": "", "entities": []}
{"id": 9026, "text": "all im going to do is put it over a common denominator", "entities": []}

{"id": 9038, "text": "before we couldnt do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 9039, "text": "why", "entities": []}
{"id": 9040, "text": "because the numerator and the denominator gave us <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"id": 9041, "text": "but now that ive made this cancellation i can pass to the limit", "entities": []}

{"id": 9043, "text": "so thats the answer", "entities": []}
{"id": 9044, "text": "all right so in other words what ive shown  let me put it up here  is that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"id": 9045, "text": "now lets look at the graph just a little bit to check this for plausibility all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 9046, "text": "whats happening here is first of all its negative", "entities": []}

{"id": 9048, "text": "you see that slope there is negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 9049, "text": "thats the simplest check that you could make", "entities": []}
{"id": 9050, "text": "and the second thing that i would just like to point out is that as <expression> goes to infinity that as we go farther to the right it gets less and less steep", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 80}, {"label": "term", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 97}]}

{"id": 9052, "text": "so thats also consistent here when <expression> is very large this is a smaller and smaller number in magnitude although its always negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"id": 9053, "text": "its always sloping down", "entities": []}
{"id": 9054, "text": "all right so ive managed to fill the boards", "entities": []}

{"id": 9057, "text": "student inaudible professor so the question is to explain again this limiting process", "entities": []}

{"id": 9063, "text": "thats the situation that weve got", "entities": []}
{"id": 9064, "text": "and now the question is what happens as this number gets smaller and smaller and smaller and gets to be practically <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 128}]}

{"id": 9068, "text": "and thats what im saying in general with this extra number here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9069, "text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"id": 9070, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 9071, "text": "student inaudible professor so the question is what happened between this step and this step right", "entities": []}
{"id": 9072, "text": "explain this step here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9073, "text": "alright so there were two parts to that", "entities": []}
{"id": 9074, "text": "the first is this <expression> which is sitting in the denominator i factored all the way out front", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"id": 9075, "text": "and so whats in the parentheses is supposed to be the same as whats in the numerator of this other expression", "entities": []}
{"id": 9076, "text": "and then at the same time as doing that i put that expression which is the difference of two fractions i expressed it with a common denominator", "entities": []}
{"id": 9077, "text": "so in the denominator here you see the product of the denominators of the two fractions", "entities": []}
{"id": 9078, "text": "and then i just figured out what the numerator had to be without really", "entities": []}
{"id": 9079, "text": "", "entities": []}
{"id": 9080, "text": "", "entities": []}
{"id": 9081, "text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"id": 9082, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 9083, "text": "so i claim that on the whole calculus gets a bad rap that its actually easier than most things", "entities": []}
{"id": 9084, "text": "but theres a perception that its harder", "entities": []}
{"id": 9085, "text": "and so i really have a duty to give you the calculus made harder story here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9086, "text": "so we have to make things harder because thats our job", "entities": []}
{"id": 9087, "text": "and this is actually what most people do in calculus and its the reason why calculus has a bad reputation", "entities": []}
{"id": 9088, "text": "so the secret is that when people ask problems in calculus they generally ask them in context", "entities": []}
{"id": 9089, "text": "and there are many many other things going on", "entities": []}
{"id": 9090, "text": "and so the little piece of the problem which is calculus is actually fairly routine and has to be isolated and gotten through", "entities": []}
{"id": 9091, "text": "but all the rest of it relies on everything else you learned in mathematics up to this stage from grade school through high school", "entities": []}
{"id": 9092, "text": "so thats the complication", "entities": []}
{"id": 9093, "text": "so now were going to do a little bit of calculus made hard", "entities": []}
{"id": 9094, "text": "by talking about a word problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9095, "text": "we only have one sort of word problem that we can pose because all weve talked about is this geometry point of view", "entities": []}
{"id": 9096, "text": "so far those are the only kinds of word problems we can pose", "entities": []}
{"id": 9097, "text": "so what were gonna do is just pose such a problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9098, "text": "so find the areas of triangles enclosed by the axes and the tangent to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"id": 9099, "text": "ok so thats a geometry problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9100, "text": "and let me draw a picture of it", "entities": []}
{"id": 9101, "text": "its practically the same as the picture for example one", "entities": []}
{"id": 9102, "text": "we only consider the first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"id": 9103, "text": "heres our shape", "entities": []}
{"id": 9104, "text": "all right its the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 9105, "text": "and heres maybe one of our tangent lines which is coming in like this", "entities": []}
{"id": 9106, "text": "and then were trying to find this area here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9107, "text": "right so theres our problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9108, "text": "so why does it have to do with calculus", "entities": []}
{"id": 9109, "text": "it has to do with calculus because theres a tangent line in it so were gonna need to do some calculus to answer this question", "entities": []}
{"id": 9110, "text": "but as youll see the calculus is the easy part", "entities": []}
{"id": 9111, "text": "so lets get started with this problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9112, "text": "first of all im gonna label a few things", "entities": []}
{"id": 9113, "text": "and one important thing to remember of course is that the curve is <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 9114, "text": "thats perfectly reasonable to do", "entities": []}
{"id": 9115, "text": "and also were gonna calculate the areas of the triangles and you could ask yourself in terms of what", "entities": []}
{"id": 9116, "text": "well were gonna have to pick a point and give it a name", "entities": []}
{"id": 9117, "text": "and since we need a number were gonna have to do more than geometry", "entities": []}
{"id": 9118, "text": "were gonna have to do some of this analysis just as weve done before", "entities": []}
{"id": 9119, "text": "so im gonna pick a point and consistent with the labeling weve done before im gonna to call it <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 107}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"id": 9120, "text": "so thats almost half the battle having notations <expression> and <expression> for the variables and <expression> and <expression> for the specific point", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 78}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 113}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 130}]}
{"id": 9121, "text": "now once you see that you have these labelings i hope its reasonable to do the following", "entities": []}
{"id": 9122, "text": "so first of all this is the point <expression> and over here is the point <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"id": 9123, "text": "thats something that were used to in graphs", "entities": []}
{"id": 9124, "text": "and in order to figure out the area of this triangle its pretty clear that we should find the base which is that we should find this location here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9125, "text": "and we should find the height so we need to find that value there", "entities": []}
{"id": 9126, "text": "lets go ahead and do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 9127, "text": "so how are we going to do this", "entities": []}
{"id": 9128, "text": "well so lets just take a look", "entities": []}
{"id": 9129, "text": "so what is it that we need to do", "entities": []}
{"id": 9130, "text": "i claim that theres only one calculus step and im gonna put a star here for this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 9131, "text": "i have to understand what the tangent line is", "entities": []}
{"id": 9132, "text": "once ive figured out what the tangent line is the rest of the problem is no longer calculus", "entities": []}
{"id": 9133, "text": "its just that slope that we need", "entities": []}
{"id": 9134, "text": "so whats the formula for the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"id": 9135, "text": "put that over here", "entities": []}
{"id": 9136, "text": "its going to be <expression>  and heres the magic number we already calculated it", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 9137, "text": "its in the box over there", "entities": []}
{"id": 9138, "text": "its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 9139, "text": "so this is the only bit of calculus in this problem", "entities": []}
{"id": 9140, "text": "but now were not done", "entities": []}
{"id": 9141, "text": "we have to finish it", "entities": []}
{"id": 9142, "text": "we have to figure out all the rest of these quantities so we can figure out the area", "entities": []}
{"id": 9143, "text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"id": 9144, "text": "so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"id": 9145, "text": "well to find this point this has a name", "entities": []}
{"id": 9146, "text": "were gonna find the so called <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"id": 9147, "text": "thats the first thing were going to do", "entities": []}
{"id": 9148, "text": "so to do that what we need to do is to find where this horizontal line meets that diagonal line", "entities": []}
{"id": 9149, "text": "and the equation for the <expression> is <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 51}]}

{"id": 13469, "text": "which is one thing that we havent done", "entities": []}
{"id": 13470, "text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"id": 13471, "text": "so what is the rectangular equation", "entities": []}
{"id": 13472, "text": "that means the x y equation for this <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 47}]}

{"id": 13477, "text": "and the reason for that is that in a minute ill explain to you why", "entities": []}

{"id": 13482, "text": "so this is a standard thing to do", "entities": []}
{"id": 13483, "text": "and its basically what youre going to do any time youre faced with an equation like this", "entities": []}
{"id": 13484, "text": "is try to work it out", "entities": []}
{"id": 13485, "text": "and in these situations where you have <expression> or <expression> youll always come out with some quadratic expression like this", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"id": 13486, "text": "now im going to combine terms", "entities": []}
{"id": 13487, "text": "so here i have <expression> and put everything on the the left side", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"id": 13488, "text": "so thats this", "entities": []}
{"id": 13489, "text": "and we recognize well youre supposed to recognize that this is whats known as a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 13490, "text": "if the signs are the same its an ellipse", "entities": []}
{"id": 13491, "text": "if the the signs are opposite its a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 13492, "text": "and in between if one of the coefficients on the quadratic is <expression> its a parabola", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"id": 13493, "text": "so now we see that the picture that we drew there is actually turns out its going to have asymptotes its going to be a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 13494, "text": "so now let me ask you the last little mindbending question that i want to ask", "entities": []}
{"id": 13495, "text": "which is what happens so now im using my right arm i guess", "entities": []}
{"id": 13496, "text": "but my elbows at the origin here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13497, "text": "what happens if i pass outside to the range where this denominator is negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 13498, "text": "it crossed <expression> and it went to negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"id": 13499, "text": "its sweeping out something over here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13500, "text": "is it sweeping out the same curve", "entities": []}
{"id": 13501, "text": "anybody have any idea what its doing", "entities": []}
{"id": 13502, "text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"id": 13503, "text": "student inaudible professor yeah exactly", "entities": []}
{"id": 13504, "text": "good answer", "entities": []}
{"id": 13505, "text": "its the other branch of the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 13506, "text": "so whats actually happening is in disguise theres another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 13507, "text": "now that is consistent with these algebraic equations", "entities": []}
{"id": 13508, "text": "the algebraic equation that i got here doesnt say which branch of the hyperbola ive got", "entities": []}
{"id": 13509, "text": "its actually got two branches", "entities": []}
{"id": 13510, "text": "and the curve really was in disguise capturing both of them", "entities": []}
{"id": 13511, "text": "i want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13512, "text": "because this is a really beautiful connection", "entities": []}
{"id": 13513, "text": "and i want to make that connection in connection also with this example", "entities": []}
{"id": 13514, "text": "the hyperbolas as you probably know are the trajectories of comets", "entities": []}
{"id": 13515, "text": "and ellipses which is what you would get if maybe you put <expression> here instead of a <expression> would be the trajectories of planets or asteroids", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"id": 13516, "text": "but theres actually something much more important physically that goes on", "entities": []}
{"id": 13517, "text": "thats special about this particular representation of the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"id": 13518, "text": "and what happens when you get the ellipses as well", "entities": []}
{"id": 13519, "text": "which is that in this case <equation> is the focus of the hyperbola", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"id": 13520, "text": "and what that means is that its actually the place where the sun is", "entities": []}
{"id": 13521, "text": "so this is the right representation if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture", "entities": []}
{"id": 13522, "text": "and pretty much any other", "entities": []}
{"id": 13523, "text": "i mean you cant tell that at all from the algebraic equations here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13524, "text": "so this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13525, "text": "and this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy", "entities": []}
{"id": 13526, "text": "namely theres something called keplers law", "entities": []}
{"id": 13527, "text": "which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant", "entities": []}
{"id": 13528, "text": "the rate of change of area relative to the center of mass relative to the sun", "entities": []}
{"id": 13529, "text": "so in  areas this is amount of area", "entities": []}
{"id": 13530, "text": "so this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this its speed varies", "entities": []}
{"id": 13531, "text": "and its speed varies according to a very specific rule", "entities": []}
{"id": 13532, "text": "namely this one here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13533, "text": "and this rule was observed by kepler", "entities": []}
{"id": 13534, "text": "but if you have this connection here we also have something else", "entities": []}
{"id": 13535, "text": "we also know that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 13536, "text": "so thats this formula here formally dividing by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"id": 13537, "text": "thats the rate of change with respect to this time parameter which is the honest to goodness time", "entities": []}
{"id": 13538, "text": "real physical time", "entities": []}
{"id": 13539, "text": "and that means this quantity here is constant", "entities": []}
{"id": 13540, "text": "and this is one of the key insights that physicists had long after kepler made his physical observations they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all because its a frictionless setup", "entities": []}
{"id": 13541, "text": "outer space theres no air", "entities": []}
{"id": 13542, "text": "nothing is going on", "entities": []}
{"id": 13543, "text": "this is whats known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum", "entities": []}
{"id": 13544, "text": "this is the expression for angular momentum", "entities": []}
{"id": 13545, "text": "and what kepler was observing it turns out is what we see all the time in real life", "entities": []}
{"id": 13546, "text": "which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate", "entities": []}
{"id": 13547, "text": "or if youre an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more you can spin faster", "entities": []}
{"id": 13548, "text": "and theres an exact quantitative rule that does that", "entities": []}
{"id": 13549, "text": "and its exactly this polar formula here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13550, "text": "so thats a neat thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 13551, "text": "and we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam", "entities": []}
{"id": 13552, "text": "so thats it for generalities and a little pep talk on whats coming up to you when you learn a little more physics", "entities": []}
{"id": 13553, "text": "right now we need to talk about the exam", "entities": []}
{"id": 13554, "text": "so first of all let me tell you what the topics are", "entities": []}
{"id": 13555, "text": "theyre the same as last years test", "entities": []}
{"id": 13556, "text": "which you can take a look at", "entities": []}
{"id": 13557, "text": "and lets see", "entities": []}
{"id": 13558, "text": "so what did we do", "entities": []}
{"id": 13559, "text": "one of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration", "entities": []}
{"id": 13560, "text": "and there are three which we will test", "entities": []}
{"id": 13561, "text": "one is trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"id": 13562, "text": "one is integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"id": 13563, "text": "and one is partial fractions", "entities": []}
{"id": 13564, "text": "so thats more than half of the exam right there", "entities": []}
{"id": 13565, "text": "the other half of the exam is parametric curves", "entities": []}
{"id": 13566, "text": "arc length", "entities": []}
{"id": 13567, "text": "these are all interrelated", "entities": []}
{"id": 13568, "text": "and area of surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}
{"id": 13569, "text": "those are the only kind that we can handle", "entities": []}
{"id": 13570, "text": "just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}
{"id": 13571, "text": "and then theres a final topic which is polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"id": 13572, "text": "and area in polar coordinates including area", "entities": []}
{"id": 13573, "text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"id": 13574, "text": "thats whats on the test there are six problems", "entities": []}
{"id": 13575, "text": "theyre very similar", "entities": []}
{"id": 13576, "text": "well theyre not actually that similar", "entities": []}
{"id": 13577, "text": "but theyre somewhat similar to last years", "entities": []}
{"id": 13578, "text": "id say the test is similar", "entities": []}
{"id": 13579, "text": "maybe a tiny bit more difficult", "entities": []}
{"id": 13580, "text": "well see", "entities": []}
{"id": 13581, "text": "well see", "entities": []}
{"id": 13582, "text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"id": 13583, "text": "student inaudible professor the question was we didnt do arc length in polar coordinates did we", "entities": []}
{"id": 13584, "text": "and the answer is no we did not", "entities": []}
{"id": 13585, "text": "we did not do arc length in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"id": 13586, "text": "when i give you an exercise im going to ask you about if you know the speed of a comet here whats the speed of the comet there", "entities": []}
{"id": 13587, "text": "and well have to know about arc length for that", "entities": []}
{"id": 13588, "text": "but were not doing it on this exam", "entities": []}
{"id": 13589, "text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"id": 13590, "text": "student inaudible professor the question is will i expect you to know <expression>  so lets see if i can formulate this question", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"id": 13591, "text": "its related to this fourleaf rose here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13592, "text": "so the question is suppose i gave you something that looked like this", "entities": []}
{"id": 13593, "text": "would i expect you to be able to know what it is", "entities": []}
{"id": 13594, "text": "i think the answer the fair answer to give you is if its this complicated i only have two possibilities", "entities": []}
{"id": 13595, "text": "i can give you a long time to sketch this out", "entities": []}
{"id": 13596, "text": "and think about what it does", "entities": []}
{"id": 13597, "text": "or i can tell you that it happens to be a threeleaf rose", "entities": []}
{"id": 13598, "text": "and then you have some clue as to what its doing", "entities": []}
{"id": 13599, "text": "it doesnt have six", "entities": []}
{"id": 13600, "text": "because of some weird thing having to do with repetitions", "entities": []}
{"id": 13601, "text": "but the odds and evens work differently", "entities": []}
{"id": 13602, "text": "so in fact i would have to tell you what the picture looks like if its going to be this complicated", "entities": []}
{"id": 13603, "text": "similarly so this is an important point to make when we come to techniques of integration any integral that you have im not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals", "entities": []}
{"id": 13604, "text": "but if its an integral that i think youre going to get stuck on either im going to give you a hint tell you how to do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 13605, "text": "or im going to tell you dont do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 13606, "text": "if i tell you dont do it dont try to do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 13607, "text": "it may be impossible", "entities": []}
{"id": 13608, "text": "and even if its possible its going to be very long", "entities": []}
{"id": 13609, "text": "like an hour", "entities": []}
{"id": 13610, "text": "so dont do it unless i tell you to", "entities": []}
{"id": 13611, "text": "on the other hand all of these setups in this second half of this unit they involve somehow setting something up", "entities": []}
{"id": 13612, "text": "and theyre basically three issues", "entities": []}
{"id": 13613, "text": "one is what the integrand is", "entities": []}
{"id": 13614, "text": "one is what the lower limit is what is the upper limit", "entities": []}
{"id": 13615, "text": "theyre just three things three inputs to setting up an integral", "entities": []}
{"id": 13616, "text": "all integrals this is going to be the setup for all of them", "entities": []}
{"id": 13617, "text": "and then the second step is evaluating", "entities": []}
{"id": 13618, "text": "which really is what we did in the first half here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13619, "text": "and unfortunately we dont have infinitely many techniques and indeed theres some integrals that cant be evaluated and some that are too long", "entities": []}
{"id": 13620, "text": "so well just try to avoid those", "entities": []}
{"id": 13621, "text": "im not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long", "entities": []}
{"id": 13622, "text": "alright other questions", "entities": []}
{"id": 13623, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 13624, "text": "student inaudible professor the question is will the percentages be the same", "entities": []}
{"id": 13625, "text": "and the answer is no", "entities": []}
{"id": 13626, "text": "ill tell you exactly", "entities": []}

{"id": 13630, "text": "thats what it came out to be", "entities": []}
{"id": 13631, "text": "you are going to want to know about all of the things that ive written down here", "entities": []}
{"id": 13632, "text": "youre definitely going to want to know for example surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}

{"id": 13634, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 13635, "text": "there was another question i saw", "entities": []}
{"id": 13636, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 13637, "text": "student inaudible professor so if you have a partial fraction with something like <expression> and maybe an <expression> and maybe an <expression> and youre interested in what happens with this denominator here", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 94}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 120}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 146}]}

{"id": 13642, "text": "this is the setup", "entities": []}
{"id": 13643, "text": "so you need student inaudible professor so if i change this to being a <expression> here then i need i guess ill have to call it <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 83}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 121, "end_offset": 125}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 129, "end_offset": 141}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 154}]}

{"id": 14035, "text": "and thats really the simplicity and thats the savings", "entities": []}
{"id": 14036, "text": "so now since this unit is called applications and these are indeed applications to math i also wanted to give you a reallife application", "entities": []}

{"id": 14057, "text": "the situation here is we have something of the form <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"id": 14058, "text": "thats whats happening when i multiply through here", "entities": []}

{"id": 14060, "text": "so in real life of course the expression that youre going to use the linear approximation on isnt necessarily itself linear", "entities": []}

{"id": 14063, "text": "and now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately  well again its the same rule", "entities": []}

{"id": 14066, "text": "so the question is when people were designing these gps systems they run clocks in the satellites", "entities": []}

{"id": 14069, "text": "and there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for", "entities": []}
{"id": 14070, "text": "so in this case what actually happened is that <expression> is about <expression> kilometers per second", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 81}]}

{"id": 14072, "text": "in fact they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they couldve tweaked this if they had put them at different places", "entities": []}

{"id": 14076, "text": "so in fact it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"id": 14077, "text": "so thats nice", "entities": []}
{"id": 14078, "text": "but in fact the engineers who were designing these systems actually did use this very computation", "entities": []}
{"id": 14079, "text": "exactly this", "entities": []}
{"id": 14080, "text": "and the way that they used it was they decided that because the clocks were different when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency that frequency would be shifted", "entities": []}
{"id": 14081, "text": "would be offset", "entities": []}
{"id": 14082, "text": "and they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of exactly this offset", "entities": []}
{"id": 14083, "text": "to compensate for the way the signal is", "entities": []}
{"id": 14084, "text": "so from the point of view of good reception on your little gps device they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites according to exactly this rule", "entities": []}
{"id": 14085, "text": "and incidentally the reason why they didnt they ignored higherorder terms the sort of quadratic terms is that if you take <expression> thats a size <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 134}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 148, "end_offset": 160}]}
{"id": 14086, "text": "and that really is totally negligible", "entities": []}
{"id": 14087, "text": "that doesnt matter to any measurement at all", "entities": []}
{"id": 14088, "text": "thats on the order of nanometers and its not important for any of the uses to which gps is put", "entities": []}
{"id": 14089, "text": "ok so thats a real example of a use of linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"id": 14090, "text": "so", "entities": []}
{"id": 14091, "text": "lets take a little pause here", "entities": []}
{"id": 14092, "text": "im going to switch gears and talk about quadratic approximations", "entities": []}
{"id": 14093, "text": "but before i do that lets have some more questions", "entities": []}

{"id": 14095, "text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"id": 14096, "text": "jerison ok so the question was asked suppose i did this by different method", "entities": []}

{"id": 5208, "text": "ok so remember in general we are trying to find the position so <expression> <expression> maybe <expression> if we are in space   of a moving point along a trajectory", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 76}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 89}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"id": 5209, "text": "and one way to think about this is in terms of the position vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5210, "text": "so position vector is just the vector whose components are coordinates of a point ok so if you prefer thats the same thing as a vector from the origin to the moving point", "entities": []}
{"id": 5211, "text": "so maybe our point is here <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"id": 5212, "text": "so this vector here  this vector here is vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"id": 5213, "text": "and thats also the position vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"id": 5214, "text": "so just to give you again that example   if i take the cycloid for a wheel of radius <expression> and lets say that we are going at unit speed so that the angle that we used as a parameter of time is the same thing as time when the position vector in this case we found to be just to make sure that they have it right ", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"id": 5215, "text": "ok thats a formula that you should have in your notes from last time except we had <expression> instead of <expression> because we were using the angle", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 95}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 119}]}
{"id": 5216, "text": "but now im saying we are moving at unit speed so time and angle are the same thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 5217, "text": "so now whats interesting about this is we can analyze the motion in more detail", "entities": []}
{"id": 5218, "text": "ok so now that we know the position of the point as a function of time we can try to study how it varies in particular things like the speed and acceleration", "entities": []}
{"id": 5219, "text": "ok so lets start with speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5220, "text": "well in fact we can do better than speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5221, "text": "lets not start with speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5222, "text": "so speed is a number", "entities": []}
{"id": 5223, "text": "it tells you how fast you are going along your trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5224, "text": "i mean if youre driving in a car then it tells you how fast you are going", "entities": []}
{"id": 5225, "text": "but unless you have one of these fancy cars with a gps it doesnt tell you which direction youre going", "entities": []}
{"id": 5226, "text": "and thats useful information too if youre trying to figure out what your trajectory is", "entities": []}
{"id": 5227, "text": "so in fact theres two aspects to it", "entities": []}
{"id": 5228, "text": "one is how fast you are going and the other is in what direction youre going", "entities": []}
{"id": 5229, "text": "that means actually we should use a vector maybe to think about this", "entities": []}
{"id": 5230, "text": "and so thats called the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5231, "text": "and the way we can get it so its called usually <expression> so <expression> here stands for velocity more than for vector", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"id": 5232, "text": "and you just get it by taking the derivative of a position vector with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5233, "text": "now its our first time writing this kind of thing with a vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5234, "text": "so the basic rule is you can take the derivative of a vector quantity just by taking the derivatives of each component", "entities": []}
{"id": 5235, "text": "ok so thats just <expression> <expression> and if you have <expression> component <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 94}]}
{"id": 5236, "text": "so let me  ok so  ok so lets see what it is for the cycloid", "entities": []}
{"id": 5237, "text": "so an example of a cycloid well so what do we get when we take the derivatives of this formula there", "entities": []}
{"id": 5238, "text": "well so the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}]}

{"id": 5241, "text": "very good", "entities": []}
{"id": 5242, "text": "ok thats at least one thing you should remember from single variable calculus", "entities": []}
{"id": 5243, "text": "hopefully you remember even more than that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5244, "text": "ok so thats the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5245, "text": "it tells us at any time how fast we are going and in what direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5246, "text": "so for example observe", "entities": []}
{"id": 5247, "text": "remember last time at the end of class we were trying to figure out what exactly happens near the bottom point when we have this motion that seems to stop and go backwards", "entities": []}
{"id": 5248, "text": "and we answered that one way", "entities": []}
{"id": 5249, "text": "but lets try to understand it in terms of velocity", "entities": []}
{"id": 5250, "text": "what if i plug <equation> in here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"id": 5251, "text": "then <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"id": 5252, "text": "the velocity is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 5253, "text": "so at the time at that particular time our point is actually not moving", "entities": []}
{"id": 5254, "text": "of course its been moving just before and it starts moving just afterwards", "entities": []}
{"id": 5255, "text": "its just the instant at that particular instant the speed is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"id": 5256, "text": "so thats especially maybe a counterintuitive thing but something is moving", "entities": []}
{"id": 5257, "text": "and at that time its actually stopped", "entities": []}
{"id": 5258, "text": "now lets see so thats the vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5259, "text": "and its useful", "entities": []}
{"id": 5260, "text": "but if you want just the usual speed as a number then what will you do", "entities": []}
{"id": 5261, "text": "well you will just take exactly the magnitude of this vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5262, "text": "so speed which is the scalar quantity is going to be just the magnitude of the vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"id": 5263, "text": "ok so in this case while it would be <expression> and if you expand that you will get let me take a bit more space its going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 143}]}
{"id": 5264, "text": "it seems to simplify a little bit because we have <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"id": 5265, "text": "thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"id": 5266, "text": "so its going to be the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"id": 5267, "text": "so at this point if i was going to ask you when is the speed the smallest or the largest", "entities": []}
{"id": 5268, "text": "you could answer based on that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5269, "text": "see at <equation> well that turns out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"id": 5270, "text": "the point is not moving", "entities": []}
{"id": 5271, "text": "at <equation> that ends up being <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"id": 5272, "text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 5273, "text": "and thats when youre truly at the top of the arch and thats when the point is moving the fastest", "entities": []}
{"id": 5274, "text": "in fact they are spending twice as fast as the wheel because the wheel is moving to the right at unit speed and the wheel is also rotating", "entities": []}
{"id": 5275, "text": "so its moving to the right and unit speed relative to the center so that the two effects add up and give you a speed of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 132}]}
{"id": 5276, "text": "anyway thats a formula we can get", "entities": []}
{"id": 5277, "text": "ok now what about acceleration", "entities": []}
{"id": 5278, "text": "so here i should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using", "entities": []}
{"id": 5279, "text": "so you might think acceleration is just the directive of speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5280, "text": "if my car goes <expression> miles an hour on the highway and its going a constant speed its not accelerating", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"id": 5281, "text": "but lets say that im taking a really tight turn", "entities": []}
{"id": 5282, "text": "then im going to feel something", "entities": []}
{"id": 5283, "text": "there is some force being exerted", "entities": []}
{"id": 5284, "text": "and in fact there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing", "entities": []}
{"id": 5285, "text": "so the definition will take effect", "entities": []}
{"id": 5286, "text": "the acceleration is as a vector and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5287, "text": "so even if the speed is constant that means even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same the velocity vector can still rotate", "entities": []}
{"id": 5288, "text": "and as it rotates it uses acceleration", "entities": []}
{"id": 5289, "text": "ok and so this is the notion of acceleration thats relevant to physics when you find <equation> thats the a that you have in mind here", "entities": []}
{"id": 5290, "text": "its a vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5291, "text": "of course if you are moving in a straight line then the two notions are the same", "entities": []}
{"id": 5292, "text": "i mean acceleration is also going to be along the line and its going to has to do with the derivative of speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5293, "text": "but in general thats not quite the same", "entities": []}
{"id": 5294, "text": "so for example lets look at the cycloid", "entities": []}
{"id": 5295, "text": "if we take the example of the cycloid well whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"id": 5296, "text": "its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 5297, "text": "and whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"id": 5298, "text": "<expression> ok", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"id": 5299, "text": "so the acceleration vector is", "entities": []}
{"id": 5300, "text": "so in particular lets look at what happens at time <equation> when the point is not moving", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5301, "text": "well the acceleration vector there will be <expression> from <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"id": 5302, "text": "so what that means is that if i look at my trajectory at this point that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5303, "text": "its the unit vector in the vertical direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5304, "text": "so my point is not moving at that particular time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5305, "text": "but its accelerating up", "entities": []}
{"id": 5306, "text": "so that means that actually as it comes down first its slowing down", "entities": []}
{"id": 5307, "text": "then it stops here and then it reverses going back up", "entities": []}
{"id": 5308, "text": "ok so thats another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because thats the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 224, "end_offset": 236}]}
{"id": 5309, "text": "ok any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5310, "text": "no", "entities": []}
{"id": 5311, "text": "ok so i should insist maybe on one thing which is that so we can differentiate vectors just component by component ok and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that well see in a moment", "entities": []}
{"id": 5312, "text": "one thing that we cannot do its not true that the length of dr dt which is the speed  the length of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 112}]}
{"id": 5313, "text": "ok this is completely false", "entities": []}
{"id": 5314, "text": "and they are really not the same", "entities": []}
{"id": 5315, "text": "so if you have to differentiate the length of a vector but basically you are in trouble", "entities": []}
{"id": 5316, "text": "if you really really want to do it well the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root and the chain rule and various other things", "entities": []}
{"id": 5317, "text": "and you can get there", "entities": []}
{"id": 5318, "text": "but it will not be a very nice expression", "entities": []}
{"id": 5319, "text": "there is no simple formula for this kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 5320, "text": "fortunately we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because after all its not a very relevant quantity", "entities": []}
{"id": 5321, "text": "whats more relevant might be this one", "entities": []}
{"id": 5322, "text": "this is actually the speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5323, "text": "this one i dont know what it means", "entities": []}
{"id": 5324, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 5325, "text": "so lets continue our exploration", "entities": []}
{"id": 5326, "text": "so the next concept that i want to define is that of arc length", "entities": []}
{"id": 5327, "text": "so arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 5328, "text": "so if you are in a car you know it has mileage counter that tells you how far youve gone how much fuel youve used if its a fancy car", "entities": []}
{"id": 5329, "text": "and what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car", "entities": []}
{"id": 5330, "text": "so the usual notation that we will have is <expression> for arc length", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"id": 5331, "text": "im not quite sure how you get an <expression> out of this but its the usual notation", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"id": 5332, "text": "ok so <expression> is for distance traveled along the trajectory", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"id": 5333, "text": "and so that makes sense of course we need to fix a reference point", "entities": []}
{"id": 5334, "text": "maybe on the cycloid wed say its a distance starting on the origin", "entities": []}
{"id": 5335, "text": "in general maybe you would say you start at time <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"id": 5336, "text": "but its a convention", "entities": []}
{"id": 5337, "text": "if you knew in advance you could have actually your cars mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking", "entities": []}
{"id": 5338, "text": "i mean that would be sneakyfreaky but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <expression> and gets to <expression> at the end of a trajectory or anything you want", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 106, "end_offset": 118}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 143}]}
{"id": 5339, "text": "i mean arc length could be positive or negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 5340, "text": "typically its negative what you are before the reference point and positive afterwards", "entities": []}
{"id": 5341, "text": "so now how does it relate to the things weve seen there", "entities": []}
{"id": 5342, "text": "well so in particular how do you relate arc length and time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5343, "text": "well so theres a simple relation which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time well thats going to be the speed at which you are moving ok because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance youre covering per unit time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5344, "text": "ok and in fact to be completely honest i should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve", "entities": []}
{"id": 5345, "text": "and then you dont want to keep counting arc length all the time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5346, "text": "actually maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve", "entities": []}
{"id": 5347, "text": "i mean you get to choose how you count it", "entities": []}
{"id": 5348, "text": "but in this case if you are moving back and forth it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase then decrease increase again and so on", "entities": []}
{"id": 5349, "text": "so  so if you want to know really what the arc length is then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5350, "text": "so if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is you have this nicelooking curve how long is it", "entities": []}
{"id": 5351, "text": "well youd have to basically integrate this quantity from <equation> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 37}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"id": 5352, "text": "and to say the truth i dont really know how to integrate that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5353, "text": "so we dont actually have a formula for the length at this point", "entities": []}
{"id": 5354, "text": "however well see one later using a cool trick and multivariable calculus", "entities": []}
{"id": 5355, "text": "so for now well just leave the formula like that and we dont know how long it is", "entities": []}
{"id": 5356, "text": "well you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value", "entities": []}
{"id": 5357, "text": "but thats the best i can offer", "entities": []}
{"id": 5358, "text": "now another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5359, "text": "so the usual notation is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"id": 5360, "text": "it has a hat because its a unit vector and <expression> because its tangent", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"id": 5361, "text": "now how do we get this unit vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5362, "text": "so maybe i should have pointed out before that if youre moving along some trajectory say youre going in that direction then when youre at this point the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5363, "text": "it tells you the direction of motion in particular", "entities": []}
{"id": 5364, "text": "so if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction all you have to do is rescale it so at its length becomes one", "entities": []}
{"id": 5365, "text": "so its <expression> divided by a magnitude of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"id": 5366, "text": "so it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way", "entities": []}
{"id": 5367, "text": "so lets see what we can say", "entities": []}
{"id": 5368, "text": "well we can say that <expression> by <expression> so thats the velocity vector thats the same thing as if i use the chain rule <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 111}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 126}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 127, "end_offset": 139}]}
{"id": 5369, "text": "ok so lets think about this things", "entities": []}
{"id": 5370, "text": "so this guy here weve just seen", "entities": []}
{"id": 5371, "text": "thats the same as the speed ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 5372, "text": "so this one here should be <expression> divided by its length", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"id": 5373, "text": "so that means this actually should be the unit vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5374, "text": "ok so let me rewrite that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5375, "text": "its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"id": 5376, "text": "so maybe if i actually stated directly that way see im just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5377, "text": "the length is the speed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5378, "text": "the direction is tangent to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5379, "text": "so the speed is <expression> and the vector is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"id": 5380, "text": "and thats how we get this", "entities": []}

{"id": 5423, "text": "no", "entities": []}
{"id": 5424, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 5425, "text": "so what happens next", "entities": []}
{"id": 5426, "text": "ok so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because after all a lot of whats here you can just do in coordinates", "entities": []}
{"id": 5427, "text": "and we dont really need vectors", "entities": []}
{"id": 5428, "text": "well and truly vectors being a language you never strictly need it but its useful to have a notion of vectors", "entities": []}
{"id": 5429, "text": "so i want to tell you a bit about keplers second law of celestial mechanics", "entities": []}
{"id": 5430, "text": "so that goes back to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"id": 5431, "text": "so thats not exactly recent news ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 5432, "text": "but still i think its a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions", "entities": []}
{"id": 5433, "text": "so what happened back then was kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move", "entities": []}
{"id": 5434, "text": "before him people were saying well they cannot move in a circle", "entities": []}
{"id": 5435, "text": "but maybe its more complicated than that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5436, "text": "we need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other and so on", "entities": []}
{"id": 5437, "text": "they have more and more complicated theories", "entities": []}
{"id": 5438, "text": "and then kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse", "entities": []}
{"id": 5439, "text": "so theres actually three laws but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation", "entities": []}
{"id": 5440, "text": "so what keplers second law says is that the motion of planets is first of all they move in a plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5441, "text": "and second the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5442, "text": "sorry is swept at constant rate", "entities": []}
{"id": 5443, "text": "from the sun to the planet it is swept out by the line at a constant rate", "entities": []}
{"id": 5444, "text": "ok so thats an interesting law because it tells you once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like it tells you how fast its going to move on that orbit", "entities": []}
{"id": 5445, "text": "ok so let me explain again", "entities": []}
{"id": 5446, "text": "so this law says maybe the sun lets put the sun here at the origin and lets have a planet", "entities": []}
{"id": 5447, "text": "well the planet orbits around the sun   in some trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5448, "text": "so this is supposed to be light blue", "entities": []}
{"id": 5449, "text": "can you see that its different from white", "entities": []}
{"id": 5450, "text": "no", "entities": []}
{"id": 5451, "text": "ok me neither", "entities": []}
{"id": 5452, "text": "laughter ok it doesnt really matter", "entities": []}
{"id": 5453, "text": "so the planet moves on its orbit", "entities": []}
{"id": 5454, "text": "and if you wait for a certain time then a bit later it would be here and then here and so on", "entities": []}
{"id": 5455, "text": "then you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge", "entities": []}
{"id": 5456, "text": "and the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed", "entities": []}
{"id": 5457, "text": "so in particular if a planet is closer to the sun then it has to go faster", "entities": []}
{"id": 5458, "text": "and if its farther away from the sun then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5459, "text": "so its a very sophisticated prediction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5460, "text": "and i think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations and trying to measure what was true that wasnt true", "entities": []}
{"id": 5461, "text": "but lets try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics", "entities": []}
{"id": 5462, "text": "so in fact what happens is that newton so newton was quite a bit later", "entities": []}
{"id": 5463, "text": "that was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century", "entities": []}
{"id": 5464, "text": "so he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5465, "text": "and youll see that if we reformulate keplers law in terms of vectors and if we work a bit with these vectors we are going to end up with something thats actually completely obvious to us now", "entities": []}
{"id": 5466, "text": "at the time it was very far from obvious but to us now to completely obvious", "entities": []}
{"id": 5467, "text": "so lets try to see what does keplers law say in terms of vectors", "entities": []}
{"id": 5468, "text": "ok so lets think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here", "entities": []}
{"id": 5469, "text": "well it might be good to think of maybe the position vector and maybe its variation", "entities": []}
{"id": 5470, "text": "so if we wait a certain amount of time well have a vector <expression> which is the change in position vector a various interval of time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5471, "text": "ok so lets start with the first step", "entities": []}
{"id": 5472, "text": "whats the most complicated thing in here", "entities": []}
{"id": 5473, "text": "its this area swept out by the line", "entities": []}
{"id": 5474, "text": "how do we express that area in terms of vectors", "entities": []}
{"id": 5475, "text": "well ive almost given the answer by drawing this picture right", "entities": []}
{"id": 5476, "text": "if i take a sufficiently small amount of time this shaded part looks like a triangle", "entities": []}
{"id": 5477, "text": "so we have to find the area of the triangle", "entities": []}
{"id": 5478, "text": "well we know how to do that now", "entities": []}
{"id": 5479, "text": "so the area is approximately  one half of the area of a parallelogram that i could form from these vectors", "entities": []}
{"id": 5480, "text": "and the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"id": 5481, "text": "ok so i should say this is the area swept in time <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"id": 5482, "text": "you should think of <expression> as relatively small", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 5483, "text": "i mean the scale of a planet that might still be a few days but small compared to the other old trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5484, "text": "so lets remember that the amount by which we moved <expression> is approximately  <expression> ok and just using the definition of a velocity vector", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 63}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 94}]}
{"id": 5485, "text": "so lets use that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5486, "text": "sorry so its approximately  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"id": 5487, "text": "i can take out the <expression> which is scalar", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 5488, "text": "so now what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate", "entities": []}
{"id": 5489, "text": "it means this thing is proportional to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"id": 5490, "text": "so that means so the law says in fact that the length of this cross product <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"id": 5491, "text": "ok <expression> has constant length", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"id": 5492, "text": "any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5493, "text": "no", "entities": []}
{"id": 5494, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 5495, "text": "yes let me try to explain that again", "entities": []}
{"id": 5496, "text": "so what im claiming is that the length of the cross products <expression> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"id": 5497, "text": "i should say with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept", "entities": []}
{"id": 5498, "text": "how do we see that", "entities": []}
{"id": 5499, "text": "well lets take a small time interval <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"id": 5500, "text": "in time <expression> our planet moves by <expression> ok", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"id": 5501, "text": "so if it moves by <expression> it means that this triangle up there has two sides", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"id": 5502, "text": "one is the position vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"id": 5503, "text": "the other one is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"id": 5504, "text": "so its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"id": 5505, "text": "thats the formula weve seen for the area of a triangle in space", "entities": []}
{"id": 5506, "text": "so the area is one half of the cross product <expression> and <expression> magnitude of the cross product", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"id": 5507, "text": "so to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional", "entities": []}
{"id": 5508, "text": "area divided by <expression> is constant at our time", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 5509, "text": "and so this is constant", "entities": []}
{"id": 5510, "text": "ok now what about the other half of the law", "entities": []}
{"id": 5511, "text": "well it says that the motion is in a plane and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place", "entities": []}
{"id": 5512, "text": "and it contains also the sun", "entities": []}
{"id": 5513, "text": "and it contains the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"id": 5514, "text": "so lets think about that plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5515, "text": "well i claim that the position vector is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5516, "text": "ok thats what we are saying", "entities": []}
{"id": 5517, "text": "but there is another vector that i know it is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5518, "text": "you could say the position vector at another time or at any time but in fact whats also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5519, "text": "ok if im moving in the plane then position and velocity are in there", "entities": []}
{"id": 5520, "text": "so the plane of motion contains <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"id": 5521, "text": "so whats the direction of the cross product <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"id": 5522, "text": "well its the direction thats perpendicular to this plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5523, "text": "so its normal to the plane of motion", "entities": []}
{"id": 5524, "text": "and that means now that actually weve put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <expression> has constant length and constant direction", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 123}]}
{"id": 5525, "text": "in fact in general maybe i should say something about this", "entities": []}
{"id": 5526, "text": "so if you just look at the position vector and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time then together they determine some plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 5527, "text": "and thats the plane that contains the origin the point and the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5528, "text": "if you want its the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5529, "text": "now of course if your motion is not in a plane then that plane will change", "entities": []}
{"id": 5530, "text": "its however instant if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time", "entities": []}
{"id": 5531, "text": "and to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 5532, "text": "ok so  laughter applause ok so keplers second law is actually equivalent to saying that <equation> ok", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"id": 5533, "text": "thats what the law says", "entities": []}
{"id": 5534, "text": "so in terms of derivatives it means <expression> is the <expression> vector", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 48}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"id": 5535, "text": "ok now so theres an interesting thing to note which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions with dot products or cross products", "entities": []}
{"id": 5536, "text": "theres only one catch which is that when we differentiate a cross product we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left", "entities": []}
{"id": 5537, "text": "the guy on the right stays on the right", "entities": []}
{"id": 5538, "text": "ok so if you know that <expression> then you are safe", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"id": 5539, "text": "if you know it as <expression> then you are not safe", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"id": 5540, "text": "ok so its the only thing to watch for", "entities": []}
{"id": 5541, "text": "so product rule is ok for taking the derivative of a dot product", "entities": []}
{"id": 5542, "text": "there you dont actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"id": 5543, "text": "there you just need to be a little bit more careful", "entities": []}
{"id": 5544, "text": "ok so now that we know that we can write this as <expression> ok", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"id": 5545, "text": "well lets reformulate things slightly", "entities": []}
{"id": 5546, "text": "so <expression> already has a name", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"id": 5547, "text": "in fact thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"id": 5548, "text": "ok thats what we call the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5549, "text": "so this is <expression> what is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"id": 5550, "text": "thats the acceleration <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"id": 5551, "text": "ok so now whats the next step", "entities": []}
{"id": 5552, "text": "well we know what <expression> is because remember a vector cross itself is always <expression> ok", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 72}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"id": 5553, "text": "so this is the same <equation> and thats the same as saying that the cross product of two vectors is <expression> exactly when the parallelogram of the form has no area", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 113}]}
{"id": 5554, "text": "and the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other", "entities": []}
{"id": 5555, "text": "so that means the acceleration is parallel to the position", "entities": []}
{"id": 5556, "text": "ok so in fact what keplers second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector", "entities": []}
{"id": 5557, "text": "and since we know that acceleration is caused by a force thats equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force   is parallel to the position vector that means well if you have the sun here at the origin and if you have your planets well the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line", "entities": []}
{"id": 5558, "text": "in fact the law doesnt even say whether its going towards the sun or away from the sun", "entities": []}
{"id": 5559, "text": "well what we know now is that of course the attraction is towards the sun", "entities": []}
{"id": 5560, "text": "but keplers law would also be true actually if things were going away", "entities": []}
{"id": 5561, "text": "so in particular say electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge", "entities": []}

{"id": 6057, "text": "well the first observation is that the velocity vector what can i say about the velocity vector of this motion", "entities": []}
{"id": 6058, "text": "its going to be tangent to the level surface right", "entities": []}

{"id": 6201, "text": "im moving at unit speed along this line", "entities": []}

{"id": 6213, "text": "kind of", "entities": []}
{"id": 6214, "text": "i see some faces that are not completely convinced", "entities": []}
{"id": 6215, "text": "so maybe you should show more pictures", "entities": []}
{"id": 6216, "text": "well let me first write down a bit more and show you something", "entities": []}

{"id": 6222, "text": "and then we take the derivative", "entities": []}

{"id": 6228, "text": "and then i can look at the slices of the graph", "entities": []}
{"id": 6229, "text": "let me see if i can use that thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 6230, "text": "so we can look at the slices of the graph that are drawn here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6231, "text": "in fact we look at the tangent lines to the slices and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here", "entities": []}

{"id": 6233, "text": "its not really colorful something more colorful", "entities": []}
{"id": 6234, "text": "well be slicing things by a plane that is now in the direction of this vector <expression> and well be looking at the slope of the slice of the graph", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"id": 6235, "text": "so what that looks like here so thats the same applet the way that youve used on your problem set in case you are wondering", "entities": []}
{"id": 6236, "text": "so now im picking a point on the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"id": 6237, "text": "and at that point i slice the graph", "entities": []}

{"id": 6241, "text": "and now if i rotate the slice then i have all of these planes", "entities": []}
{"id": 6242, "text": "so you see at the bottom left i have the direction in which im going", "entities": []}
{"id": 6243, "text": "theres this like rotating line that tells you in which direction im going to be moving", "entities": []}
{"id": 6244, "text": "and for each direction i have a plane", "entities": []}
{"id": 6245, "text": "and when i slice by that plane i will get so i have this direction here going maybe to the southwest", "entities": []}
{"id": 6246, "text": "so that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane and the slice has a certain slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 6247, "text": "and the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 6248, "text": "ok i think thats as graphic as i can get", "entities": []}
{"id": 6249, "text": "ok any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6250, "text": "no", "entities": []}
{"id": 6251, "text": "ok so lets see how we compute that guy", "entities": []}

{"id": 6268, "text": "ok ok lets do a little bit of geometry here", "entities": []}

{"id": 6274, "text": "but now what does that tell us", "entities": []}
{"id": 6275, "text": "well lets try to figure out in which directions w changes the fastest in which direction it increases the most or decreases the most or doesnt actually change", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 49}]}

{"id": 6277, "text": "if i fix a point if i set a point then the gradient vector at that point is given to me", "entities": []}

{"id": 6284, "text": "the gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6285, "text": "so the direction of gradient <expression> is the direction of fastest increase of <expression> at the given point", "entities": []}

{"id": 6287, "text": "well its actually the directional derivative in that direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 6288, "text": "ok so if i go in that direction which gives me the fastest increase then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient", "entities": []}
{"id": 6289, "text": "and with the direction of the fastest decrease", "entities": []}
{"id": 6290, "text": "its going in the opposite direction right", "entities": []}
{"id": 6291, "text": "i mean if you are on a mountain and you know that you are facing the mountain thats the direction of fastest increase", "entities": []}
{"id": 6292, "text": "the direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down", "entities": []}
{"id": 6293, "text": "ok so the minimal value of <expression> is achieved when <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 85}]}

{"id": 6296, "text": "it points opposite to the gradient", "entities": []}
{"id": 6297, "text": "and finally when do we have <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"id": 6298, "text": "so in which direction does the function not change", "entities": []}
{"id": 6299, "text": "well we have two answers to that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6300, "text": "one is to just use the formula", "entities": []}
{"id": 6301, "text": "so thats <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"id": 6302, "text": "that means <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"id": 6303, "text": "that means that <expression> is perpendicular to the gradient", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 6304, "text": "the other way to think about it the direction in which the value doesnt change is a direction thats tangent to the level surface", "entities": []}
{"id": 6305, "text": "if we are not changing a it means we are moving along the level", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"id": 6306, "text": "and thats the same thing   as being tangent to the level", "entities": []}
{"id": 6307, "text": "so let me just show that on the picture here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6308, "text": "so if actually show you the gradient you cant really see it here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6309, "text": "i need to move it a bit", "entities": []}
{"id": 6310, "text": "so the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that i have chosen", "entities": []}
{"id": 6311, "text": "now if i choose a slice thats perpendicular and a direction thats perpendicular to the gradient so thats actually tangent to the level curve then you see that my slice is flat", "entities": []}
{"id": 6312, "text": "i dont actually have any slop", "entities": []}
{"id": 6313, "text": "the directional derivative in a direction thats perpendicular to the gradient is basically <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"id": 6314, "text": "now if i rotate then the slope sort of increases increases increases and it becomes the largest when im going in the direction of a gradient", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"id": 6315, "text": "so here i have actually a pretty big slope", "entities": []}
{"id": 6316, "text": "and now if i keep rotating then the slope will decrease again", "entities": []}
{"id": 6317, "text": "then it becomes <expression> when i perpendicular and then it becomes negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"id": 6318, "text": "its the most negative when i pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <expression> again when im back perpendicular", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"id": 6319, "text": "ok so for example if i give you a contour plot and i ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector well at this point for example you would look at the picture", "entities": []}
{"id": 6320, "text": "the gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level", "entities": []}
{"id": 6321, "text": "and it would be going towards higher values of a function", "entities": []}
{"id": 6322, "text": "i dont know if you can see the labels but the thing in the middle is a minimum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6323, "text": "so it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction", "entities": []}
{"id": 6324, "text": "ok so thats it for today", "entities": []}
{"id": 6756, "text": "so today we are going to continue looking at critical points and well learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum maximum or a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6757, "text": "so thats the main topic for today", "entities": []}
{"id": 6758, "text": "so remember yesterday we looked at critical points of functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"id": 6759, "text": "and so a critical point functions we have two values <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"id": 6760, "text": "thats a point where the partial derivatives are both <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"id": 6761, "text": "and weve seen that theres various kinds of critical points", "entities": []}
{"id": 6762, "text": "theres local minima", "entities": []}
{"id": 6763, "text": "so maybe i should show the function on this contour plot there is local maxima which are like that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6764, "text": "and theres saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima", "entities": []}
{"id": 6765, "text": "and of course if you have a real function then it would be more complicated", "entities": []}
{"id": 6766, "text": "it will have several critical points", "entities": []}
{"id": 6767, "text": "so this example here well you see on the plot that there is two maxima", "entities": []}
{"id": 6768, "text": "and there is in the middle between them a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6769, "text": "and actually you can see them on the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"id": 6770, "text": "on the contour plot you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6771, "text": "and you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight", "entities": []}
{"id": 6772, "text": "it crosses itself", "entities": []}
{"id": 6773, "text": "and if you move up or down here so along the y direction the values of the function will decrease", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"id": 6774, "text": "along the x direction the values will increase", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"id": 6775, "text": "so you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots", "entities": []}
{"id": 6776, "text": "so the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same", "entities": []}
{"id": 6777, "text": "just of course in one case the values increase and in another one they decrease", "entities": []}
{"id": 6778, "text": "so the question   is how do we decide   between the various possibilities", "entities": []}
{"id": 6779, "text": "so local minimum local maximum or saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6780, "text": "so and in fact why do we care", "entities": []}
{"id": 6781, "text": "well the other question is how do we find the global minimummaximum of a function", "entities": []}
{"id": 6782, "text": "so here what i should point out well first of all to decide where the function is the largest in general youll have actually to compare the values", "entities": []}
{"id": 6783, "text": "for example here if you want to know what is the maximum of this function", "entities": []}
{"id": 6784, "text": "well we have two obvious candidates", "entities": []}
{"id": 6785, "text": "we have this local maximum and that local maximum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6786, "text": "and the question is which one is the higher of the two", "entities": []}
{"id": 6787, "text": "well in this case actually there is actually a tie for maximum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6788, "text": "but in general you would have to compute the function at both points and compare the values if you know that its three at one of them and four at the other", "entities": []}
{"id": 6789, "text": "well four wins", "entities": []}
{"id": 6790, "text": "the other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function well the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points", "entities": []}
{"id": 6791, "text": "so wheres the minimum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6792, "text": "well it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6793, "text": "so thats another feature", "entities": []}
{"id": 6794, "text": "the global minimum or maximum doesnt have to be at a critical point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6795, "text": "it could also be somehow on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6796, "text": "so we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where actually the minimum and maximum will be", "entities": []}
{"id": 6797, "text": "so in general i should point out these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6798, "text": "so by that i mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering", "entities": []}
{"id": 6799, "text": "and so we have to try both", "entities": []}
{"id": 6800, "text": "ok but so well get back to that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6801, "text": "for now lets try to focus on the question of you know whats the type of the critical point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6802, "text": "so well use something thats known as the second derivative test", "entities": []}
{"id": 6803, "text": "and in principle well the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable namely the function of one variable", "entities": []}
{"id": 6804, "text": "if the derivative is zero then you know that you should look at the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6805, "text": "and that will tell you whether its curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min", "entities": []}
{"id": 6806, "text": "and the main problem here is of course we have more possible situations and we have several derivatives", "entities": []}
{"id": 6807, "text": "so we have to think a bit harder about how well decide", "entities": []}
{"id": 6808, "text": "but it will again involve the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6809, "text": "ok so lets start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method", "entities": []}
{"id": 6810, "text": "ok so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function thats actually just quadratic", "entities": []}
{"id": 6811, "text": "so lets say i have a function <expression> thats of the form <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"id": 6812, "text": "ok so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <expression> well and if you plug <equation> youll get <expression> and same with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 84}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 113}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 145}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 168}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 194, "end_offset": 206}]}
{"id": 6813, "text": "you can also see if you try to do a linear approximation of this well all these guys are much smaller than <expression> and <expression> when <expression> and <expression> are small", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 119}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 124, "end_offset": 136}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 154}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 159, "end_offset": 171}]}
{"id": 6814, "text": "so the linear approximation the tangent plane to the graph is really just <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"id": 6815, "text": "ok so how do we do it", "entities": []}
{"id": 6816, "text": "well yesterday we actually did an example", "entities": []}
{"id": 6817, "text": "it was a bit more complicated than that but let me do it so remember we were looking at something that started with <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 128}]}
{"id": 6818, "text": "and there were other terms", "entities": []}
{"id": 6819, "text": "but lets forget them now", "entities": []}
{"id": 6820, "text": "and what we did is we said well we can rewrite this as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"id": 6821, "text": "and now this is a sum of two squares", "entities": []}
{"id": 6822, "text": "so each of these guys has to be nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6823, "text": "and so the origin will be a minimum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6824, "text": "well it turns out we can do something similar in general no matter what the values of <expression> <expression> and <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"id": 6825, "text": "well just try to first complete things to a square", "entities": []}
{"id": 6826, "text": "ok so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6827, "text": "so in general well let me be slightly less general and let me assume that a is not zero because otherwise i cant do what im going to do", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 75}, {"label": "term", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 87}]}

{"id": 6830, "text": "and now this looks like the beginning of the square of something ok just like what we did over there", "entities": []}
{"id": 6831, "text": "so what is it the square of", "entities": []}
{"id": 6832, "text": "well youd start with <expression> plus i claim if i put <expression> and i square it then see the cross term <expression> will become <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 81}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 120}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 146}]}

{"id": 6856, "text": "ok and thats kind of unreadable after ive canceled everything but if you follow it you see that basically ive just rewritten my initial function", "entities": []}
{"id": 6857, "text": "ok is that kind of ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 6858, "text": "i mean otherwise theres just no substitute", "entities": []}
{"id": 6859, "text": "youll have to do it yourself im afraid", "entities": []}
{"id": 6860, "text": "ok so let me continue to play with this", "entities": []}
{"id": 6861, "text": "so im just going to put this in a slightly different form just to clear the denominators", "entities": []}
{"id": 6862, "text": "ok so i will instead write this as <expression> times the big thing", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}

{"id": 6864, "text": "ok so far i have the same thing as here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6865, "text": "i just introduced the <expression> that cancels out plus for the other one im just clearing the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"id": 6866, "text": "i end up with <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"id": 6867, "text": "ok so thats a lot of terms", "entities": []}
{"id": 6868, "text": "but what does it look like", "entities": []}
{"id": 6869, "text": "well it looks like so we have some constant factors and here we have a square and here we have a square", "entities": []}
{"id": 6870, "text": "so basically weve written this as a sum of two squares well a sum or a difference of two squares", "entities": []}
{"id": 6871, "text": "and maybe thats what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because see if you take a sum of two squares that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values", "entities": []}
{"id": 6872, "text": "and you will have the function will always take nonnegative values", "entities": []}
{"id": 6873, "text": "so the origin will be a minimum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6874, "text": "well if you have a difference of two squares that typically youll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger you will have a positive or a negative quantity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6875, "text": "ok so i claim theres various cases to look at", "entities": []}
{"id": 6876, "text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"id": 6877, "text": "so in fact i claim there will be three cases", "entities": []}
{"id": 6878, "text": "and thats good news for us because after all we want to distinguish between three possibilities", "entities": []}
{"id": 6879, "text": "so lets first do away with the most complicated one", "entities": []}
{"id": 6880, "text": "what if <expression> is negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"id": 6881, "text": "well if its negative then it means what i have between the brackets is so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity while the second one will be something negative times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 175, "end_offset": 187}]}
{"id": 6882, "text": "so it will be a negative quantity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6883, "text": "ok so one term is positive", "entities": []}
{"id": 6884, "text": "the other is negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6885, "text": "that tells us we actually have a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6886, "text": "we have in fact written our function as a difference of two squares", "entities": []}
{"id": 6887, "text": "ok is that convincing", "entities": []}
{"id": 6888, "text": "so if you want what i could do is actually i could change my coordinates have new coordinates called <equation> actually well i could keep y and that it would look like the difference of squares directly", "entities": []}
{"id": 6889, "text": "ok so thats the first case", "entities": []}
{"id": 6890, "text": "the second case is where <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"id": 6891, "text": "well what happens if thats zero", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"id": 6892, "text": "then it means that this term over there goes away", "entities": []}
{"id": 6893, "text": "so what we have is just one square", "entities": [{"label": "term", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"id": 6894, "text": "ok so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things", "entities": []}
{"id": 6895, "text": "in the other direction its going to actually be degenerate", "entities": []}
{"id": 6896, "text": "so for example forget all the clutter in there", "entities": []}
{"id": 6897, "text": "say i give you just the function of two variables <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"id": 6898, "text": "so that means it doesnt depend on <expression> at all", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"id": 6899, "text": "and if i try to plot the graph it will look like well <expression> is here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}]}

{"id": 6901, "text": "so what the graph looks like is something like that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6902, "text": "ok basically its a valley whose bottom is completely flat", "entities": []}
{"id": 6903, "text": "so that means actually we have a degenerate critical point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6904, "text": "its called degenerate because there is a direction in which nothing happens", "entities": []}
{"id": 6905, "text": "and in fact you have critical points everywhere along the y axis", "entities": []}
{"id": 6906, "text": "now whether the square that we have is <expression> or something else namely <expression> it doesnt matter", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 89}]}
{"id": 6907, "text": "i mean it will still get this degenerate behavior", "entities": []}
{"id": 6908, "text": "but theres a direction in which nothing happens because we just have the square of one quantity", "entities": []}
{"id": 6909, "text": "im sure that <expression> students means <expression> different ring tones but im not eager to hear all of them thanks", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"id": 6910, "text": "laughter ok so this is whats called a degenerate critical point and laughter", "entities": []}
{"id": 6911, "text": "ok so basically well leave it here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6912, "text": "we wont actually try to figure out further what happens and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function a general function not just one thats quadratic like this then there will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers maybe <expression> or <expression> or things like that", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 255, "end_offset": 267}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 271, "end_offset": 283}]}
{"id": 6913, "text": "and then they will mess up what happens in this valley", "entities": []}
{"id": 6914, "text": "and its a situation where we wont be able actually to tell automatically just by looking at second derivatives what happens", "entities": []}
{"id": 6915, "text": "see for example in a function of one variable if you have just a function of one variable say <expression> well if you try to decide what type of point the origin is youre going to take the second derivative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 106}]}
{"id": 6916, "text": "it will be <expression> and then you can conclude", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"id": 6917, "text": "those things depend on higher order derivatives", "entities": []}
{"id": 6918, "text": "so we just wont like that case", "entities": []}
{"id": 6919, "text": "we just wont try to figure out whats going on here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6920, "text": "now the last situation is if <expression> is positive", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"id": 6921, "text": "so then that means that actually weve written things", "entities": []}
{"id": 6922, "text": "the big bracket up there is a sum of two squares", "entities": []}
{"id": 6923, "text": "so that means that weve written <expression> as <expression> plus something squared plus something else squared ok", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"id": 6924, "text": "so these guys have the same sign and that means that this term here will always be greater than or  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 112}]}
{"id": 6925, "text": "and that means that we should either have a maximum or minimum", "entities": []}
{"id": 6926, "text": "how we find out which one it is", "entities": []}
{"id": 6927, "text": "well we look at the sign of a exactly", "entities": []}
{"id": 6928, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 6929, "text": "so theres two subcases", "entities": []}
{"id": 6930, "text": "one is if a is positive then this quantity overall will always be nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6931, "text": "and that means we have a minimum ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 6932, "text": "and if a is negative on the other hand so that means that we multiply this positive quantity by a negative number we get something thats always negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6933, "text": "so <expression> is actually the maximum", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"id": 6934, "text": "ok is that clear for everyone", "entities": []}
{"id": 6935, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 6936, "text": "sorry yeah so i said in the example <equation> it doesnt depend on <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "equation", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"id": 6937, "text": "so the more general situation is <expression>  some constant", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"id": 6938, "text": "well i guess its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"id": 6939, "text": "so it does depend on <expression> and <expression> but it only depends on this combination", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"id": 6940, "text": "ok so if i choose to move in some other perpendicular direction in the direction where this remains constant so maybe if i set <equation> then this remains zero all the time", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 126}, {"label": "equation", "start_offset": 127, "end_offset": 137}, {"label": "term", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 160}]}
{"id": 6941, "text": "so theres a degenerate direction in which i stay at the minimum or maximum or whatever it is that i have", "entities": []}
{"id": 6942, "text": "ok so thats why its called degenerate", "entities": []}
{"id": 6943, "text": "there is a direction in which nothing happens", "entities": []}
{"id": 6944, "text": "ok yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 6945, "text": "yes yeah so thats a very good question", "entities": []}
{"id": 6946, "text": "so theres going to be the second derivative test", "entities": []}
{"id": 6947, "text": "why do not have derivatives yet", "entities": []}
{"id": 6948, "text": "well thats because ive been looking at this special example where we have a function like this", "entities": []}
{"id": 6949, "text": "and so i dont actually need to take derivatives yet", "entities": []}
{"id": 6950, "text": "but secretly thats because <expression> <expression> and <expression> will be the second derivatives of the function actually <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 52}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 138}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 139, "end_offset": 151}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 168}]}
{"id": 6951, "text": "so now we are going to go to general function", "entities": []}
{"id": 6952, "text": "and there instead of having these coefficients <expression> <expression> and  given to us well have to compute them as second derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 72}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"id": 6953, "text": "ok so here im basically setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion well use using second derivatives", "entities": []}
{"id": 6954, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 6955, "text": "so yeah so what you have a degenerate critical point it could be a degenerate minimum or a degenerate maximum depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 147}]}
{"id": 6956, "text": "but in general once you start having functions you dont really know what will happen anymore", "entities": []}
{"id": 6957, "text": "it could also be a degenerate saddle and so on", "entities": []}
{"id": 6958, "text": "so we wont really be able to tell", "entities": []}
{"id": 6959, "text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"id": 6960, "text": "it is possible to have a degenerate saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6961, "text": "for example if i gave you <expression> you can convince yourself that if you take <expression> and <expression> to be negative it will be negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 94}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"id": 6962, "text": "if <expression> and <expression> are positive its positive", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"id": 6963, "text": "and it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin", "entities": []}
{"id": 6964, "text": "so thats a degenerate saddle point", "entities": []}
{"id": 6965, "text": "we dont see it here because that doesnt happen if you have only quadratic terms like that", "entities": []}
{"id": 6966, "text": "you need to have higherorder terms to see it happen", "entities": []}
{"id": 6967, "text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"id": 6968, "text": "ok so lets continue", "entities": []}
{"id": 6969, "text": "before we continue but see i wanted to point out one small thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 6970, "text": "so here we have the magic quantity <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"id": 6971, "text": "youve probably seen that before in your life", "entities": []}
{"id": 6972, "text": "yet it looks like the quadratic formula except that one involves <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"id": 6973, "text": "but thats really the same thing", "entities": []}
{"id": 6974, "text": "ok so lets see where does the quadratic formula come in here", "entities": []}
{"id": 6975, "text": "well let me write things differently", "entities": []}
{"id": 6976, "text": "ok so weve manipulated things and got into a conclusion", "entities": []}
{"id": 6977, "text": "but let me just do a different manipulation and write this now instead as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"id": 6978, "text": "ok see thats the same thing that i had before", "entities": []}
{"id": 6979, "text": "well so now this quantity here is always nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6980, "text": "what about this one", "entities": []}
{"id": 6981, "text": "well of course this one depends on <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"id": 6982, "text": "it means it depends on which direction youre going to move away from the origin which ratio between <expression> and <expression> you will consider", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 112}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"id": 6983, "text": "but i claim theres two situations", "entities": []}
{"id": 6984, "text": "one is so lets try to reformulate things", "entities": []}
{"id": 6985, "text": "so if a discriminate here is positive then it means that these have roots and these have solutions", "entities": []}
{"id": 6986, "text": "and that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 6987, "text": "this quantity takes positive and negative values", "entities": []}
{"id": 6988, "text": "one way to convince yourself is just to you know plot <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"id": 6989, "text": "you know that theres two roots", "entities": []}
{"id": 6990, "text": "so it might look like this or might look like that depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"id": 6991, "text": "but in either case it will take values of both signs", "entities": []}
{"id": 6992, "text": "so that means that your function will take values of both signs", "entities": []}
{"id": 6993, "text": "the value takes both positive and negative values", "entities": []}
{"id": 6994, "text": "and so that means we have a saddle point while the other situation when <expression> is negative   means that this equation is quadratic never takes the value <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 84}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 159, "end_offset": 171}]}
{"id": 6995, "text": "so its always positive or its always negative depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"id": 6996, "text": "so the other case is if <expression> is negative then the quadratic doesnt have a solution", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"id": 6997, "text": "and it could look like this or like that depending on whether <expression> is positive or <expression> is negative", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 74}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 90, "end_offset": 102}]}
{"id": 6998, "text": "so in particular that means that <expression> is always positive or always negative depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "expression", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"id": 6999, "text": "and then that tells us that our function  will be always positive or always negative", "entities": []}
{"id": 7000, "text": "and then well get a minimum or maximum", "entities": []}
{"id": 7001, "text": "ok well have a min or a max depending on which situation we are in", "entities": []}
{"id": 7002, "text": "ok so thats another way to derive the same answer", "entities": []}
{"id": 7003, "text": "and now you see here why the discriminate plays a role", "entities": []}
{"id": 7004, "text": "thats because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign or whether it can actually cross the value <expression> when you have the root of a quadratic", "entities": [{"label": "expression", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 147}]}
{"id": 7005, "text": "ok so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations at least", "entities": []}
{"id": 7006, "text": "and now you are willing to believe i hope that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function", "entities": []}
{"id": 7007, "text": "ok so now what do we do with the general function", "entities": []}
{"id": 7008, "text": "well so in general we want to look at second derivatives", "entities": []}
{"id": 7009, "text": "ok so now we are getting to the real stuff", "entities": []}
{"id": 7010, "text": "so how many second derivatives do we have", "entities": []}
{"id": 7011, "text": "thats maybe the first thing we should figure out", "entities": []}

{"id": 7017, "text": "well good news", "entities": []}
{"id": 7018, "text": "these are actually always  to each other", "entities": []}
{"id": 7019, "text": "ok so its the fact that we will admit its actually not very hard to check", "entities": []}

{"id": 7021, "text": "we dont need to worry about which one we do", "entities": []}

{"id": 7103, "text": "why cant we just say well its going to be a degenerate critical point", "entities": []}
{"id": 7104, "text": "so the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible", "entities": []}
{"id": 7105, "text": "ok so in fact secretly theres more terms", "entities": []}
{"id": 7106, "text": "this is only an approximation", "entities": []}
{"id": 7107, "text": "there would be terms involving third derivatives and maybe even beyond that", "entities": []}
{"id": 7108, "text": "and so it is not to generate case they dont actually matter because the shape of the function the shape of the graph is actually determined by the quadratic terms", "entities": []}
{"id": 7109, "text": "but in the degenerate case see if i start with this and i add something even very very small along the y axis then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down and turn my degenerate point in to either a minimum or a saddle point", "entities": []}
