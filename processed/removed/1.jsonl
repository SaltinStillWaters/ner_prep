{"text": "hi", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this video were going to compute some useful quantities for the exponential random variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> looks like this and the formula is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets go right in", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is the probability that <expression> is less than or  little <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets look at some cases here", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if little <expression> is less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> random variable only takes on these nonnegative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the probability that <expression> is less than or  some negative number is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand if <expression> is greater than or  <expression> we do actually have to integrate here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to do that we take the integral from <expression> to <expression> the dummy variable here used is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7698, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 7699, "label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and now we plug in for <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and recall that the integral of <expression> to the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here in this case well get <expression> which is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then a here is going to be negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get this <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> cancel and we actually get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7717, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we are done with the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for the expectation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we use the standard formula which is <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we do the integral from <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but at the end the day youre going to have to pull out your calculus textbook and find the integration by parts formula which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the hope is that this integral is going to be easier than the <expression> on the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice that this is the integral of <expression> of the terms here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the derivative of <expression> of the terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that may help you decide on how you select <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the derivative is whats going to go in that integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> im going to select as whatevers left over", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is going to be we already did the integral <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if we do this its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that goes from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is evaluated from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what does it mean for this to be evaluated from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a better and easier way to look at this is to say well its going to go from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then you take the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7759, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7760, "label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so thats going to help us here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this negative these negatives cancel", "entities": [{"id": 7761, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}, {"id": 7762, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so theyre kind of competing for each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the exponential is going to win because it decays way faster than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this <expression> term is going to go off the limit is going to go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the expectation is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now whats the variance", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats part c right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we use the standard formula for variance which is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already figured out the expectation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just need to figure out the expectation of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well were just going to follow the same set of steps from before", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is going to be exactly the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a negative sign out here so the negatives cancel and were left with a positive sign here", "entities": [{"id": 7786, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 52}, {"id": 7787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "this is going to change", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to do this integral we can use a trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "we move this <expression> in here leave the <expression> inside", "entities": [{"id": 7797, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "and you have to leave the <expression> inside", "entities": []}
{"text": "but multiply by <expression> and divide by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7801, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 7803, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "now look at that integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "exactly the expectation that we computed", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already did that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is just <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> the exponential will beat <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no matter what polynomial we put in there the exponentials going to win", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression>s going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7813, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so were left with <expression> for expectation of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we have <expression> for the variance", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so were done with the variance", "entities": []}
{"text": "part d", "entities": []}
{"text": "were given that <expression> <expression> and <expression> are independent and identically distributed", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre exponentials with rate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were asked for the <expression> which is the max of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we generally find a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is going to have the same sort of structure as before", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is less than <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> are positive nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is the probability that if you get little <expression> less than <expression> youre not going to have any probability there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if <expression> is greater than or  <expression> is where it gets interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need to do something special", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the special thing here is to recognize that the probability of the max being less than or  <expression> is actually also the probability of each of these random variables individually being less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is that true", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if <expression> <expression> and <expression> are individually less than or  <expression> then the max is also less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these <expression> events are equivalent and this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "by independence we can break this up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get these are all cdfs of the exponential and they all have this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "plug this in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the same like this for <expression> less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "for <expression> greater than or  to <expression> its going to be the derivative of this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "there we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the pdf we were looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so last problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "were looking for the <expression> which is the min of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try this as a similar approach", "entities": []}
{"text": "try the same thing actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "see if it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if this works", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it true that the <expression> if the min of <expression> and <expression> is less than or  <expression> that each of them is less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> could be less than or  <expression> and <expression> could be bigger than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the min could still be less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats definitely not true", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do we do here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in that case lets check if we can do this trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if <expression> and <expression> are individually bigger than <expression> then clearly the mins also bigger than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this works", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can use independence as before", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be notice the similarity between this and this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only difference is this has a <expression> in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that <expression> is an exponential random variable with rate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then the <expression> is going to be an exponential whatever it is for an exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "except with rate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can also take the derivative of this and find that you get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so were done with the problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "we computed some interesting quantities for the exponential random variable in this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if <expression> and <expression> are solutions then <expression> is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets actually do problems because i think that will actually help you learn as opposed to help you get confused", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i have this differential equation the <expression> derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> plus <expression> times the <expression> derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> plus <expression> times <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7934, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so we need to find a <expression> where <expression> times its <expression> derivative plus <expression> times its <expression> derivative plus <expression> times itself  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "like if <expression> was <expression> then <expression> would be <expression> and <expression> would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe the constant in front of the function changes as i take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if youve listened to a lot of my videos youd realize that it probably is what i consider to be the most amazing function in mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in particular maybe <expression> wont work here or you can even try it out right", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you did <expression> it wont satisfy this equation right", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just make the assumption that <equation> substitute it back into this and then see if we can actually solve for an <expression> that makes this equation true", "entities": [{"id": 7963, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 7964, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "and if we can weve found the solution or maybe weve found several solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the <expression> derivative of it <expression> of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>is  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "derivative of the inside is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then derivative of the outside is still just <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the <expression> derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were ready to substitute back in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will switch colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> derivative thats <expression> plus <expression> times the <expression> derivative so thats <expression> plus <expression> times our function <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7993, "label": "command", "start_offset": 124, "end_offset": 128}, {"id": 7994, "label": "command", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 147}, {"id": 7995, "label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 73}, {"id": 7996, "label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "and something might already be surfacing to you as something we can do this equation to solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of these terms on the left all have an <expression> to the <expression> so lets factor that out", "entities": [{"id": 7991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 99}, {"id": 7992, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so this  <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and our goal remember was to solve for the <expression> or the <expression>s that will make this true", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order for this side of the equation to be <expression> what do we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "can <expression> ever  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "can you ever get something to some exponent and get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well no", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this cannot  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do that in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know if we want to solve for <expression> that this <expression> that has to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is called the characteristic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this the <expression> is called the characteristic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it should be obvious to you that now this is no longer calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just factoring a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> actually is fairly straightforward to factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the solutions of the characteristic equation or actually the solutions to this original equation are <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what are those", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the <expression> <expression> is <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the <expression> solution we found <expression> is <expression> to the what is this", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now my question to you is is this the most general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in the last video in kind of our introductory video we learned that a constant times a solution is still a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets multiply it by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8125, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats a <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is also going to be a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now its a little bit more general right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a whole class of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> doesnt have to just be <expression> it can be any constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you use your initial values you actually can figure out what that constant is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and same for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> doesnt have to be <expression> it has to be any constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we learned that in the last video that if somethings a solution some constant times that is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we also learned that if we have <expression> different solutions that if you add them together you also get a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the most general solution to this differential equation is <expression> we could say <expression> just to hit it home that this is definitely a function of <expression> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "and this is the general solution of this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i wont prove it because the proof is fairly involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean we just tried out <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe theres some other wacko function that would have worked here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill tell you now and you kind of have to take it as a leap of faith that this is the only general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "there isnt some crazy outside function there that would have also worked", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the other question that might be popping in your brain is sal when we did <expression> order differential equations we only had <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that was ok because we had <expression> set of initial conditions and we solved for our constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "but here i have <expression> constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i wanted a particular solution how can i solve for <expression> variables if im only given <expression> initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if thats what you actually thought your intuition would be correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "you actually need <expression> initial conditions to solve this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would need to know at a given value of <expression> what <expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe at a given value of <expression> what the <expression> derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is what we will do in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were through with techniques of integration which is really the most technical thing that were going to be doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were just clearing up a few loose ends about calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> were going to talk about today will allow us to deal with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its whats known as lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what were going to do today", "entities": []}
{"text": "lhopitals rule its also known as lhospitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same name since the circumflex is what you put in french to omit the s", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the same thing and its still pronounced lhopital even if its got an s in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so thats the <expression> thing you need to know about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what this method does is its a convenient way to calculate limits including some new ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "so itll be convenient for the old ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are going to be some new ones and as an example you can calculate <expression> as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could whoops thats not a very interesting <expression> lets try <expression> goes to <expression> from the positive side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can calculate for example <expression> as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well maybe i should include a few others", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe something like ln <expression> as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are some examples of things which in fact if you plug into your calculator you can see whats happening with these", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you want to understand them systematically its much better to have this tool of lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and certainly there isnt a proof just based on a calculation in a calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well make it systematic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were going to generalize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well make it much more so when it includes these new limits there are some little pieces of trickiness that you have to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a limit that we couldve handled", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the thing thats interesting i mean if you like this is in this category that we mentioned at the beginning of the course of interesting limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats interesting about it is that if you do this silly thing which is just plug in <equation> at <equation> youre going to get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8175, "label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "and thats what we call an indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just unclear what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "from that plugging in you just cant get it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now on the other hand theres a trick for doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the trick that we did at the beginning of the class", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the idea is i can divide in the numerator and denominator by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8177, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8178, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 45}, {"id": 8179, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "so this limit is unchanged if i try to cancel the hidden factor <expression> in the numerator and denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8181, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "now we can actually carry out these ratios of polynomials and calculate them by long division in algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats very very long", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to do this with calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we already have", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already know that this ratio is whats called a difference quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the limit it tends to the derivative of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the idea is that this is actually  in the limit now lets just study <expression> piece of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know what the numerator goes to and similarly well know what the denominator goes to", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know what the answer is", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the numerator its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the denominator its going to be <expression> thats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8194, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 8195, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and then were going to have to evaluate that at <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and so its going to be <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its pretty easy to get from our techniques and knowledge of derivatives using this rather clever algebraic trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "this business of dividing by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i want to do now is just carry this method out systematically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats going to give us the approach to whats known as lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "what my main subject for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose were considering in general a limit as <expression> goes to some number a of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and suppose its the bad case where we cant decide", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its in determinate", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were just going to do exactly the same thing we did over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely were going to divide a numerator and denominator and were going to repeat that argument", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent changed anything yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to write it in this suggestive form", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely im going to take separately the limit in the numerator and the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why am i allowed to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i didnt change this numerator of the numerator any by subtracting", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do the same thing to the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "again <equation> so this is ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lo and behold i know what these limits are", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the technique and this evaluates the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its not so difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "the formulas pretty straightforward here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it works provided that <expression> is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is is there a more intuitive way of understanding this procedure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think the short answer is that there are other similar ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont consider them to be more intuitive", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its very important to understand all of these more or less at once", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i wouldnt claim that any of these methods is a more intuitive <expression> than the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "but basically whats happening is were looking at the linear approximation to <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the linear approximation to <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what underlies this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "version 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not going to be quite the same as what we just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be much much better", "entities": []}
{"text": "and more useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is going to take care of is this problem that the denominator is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres what were going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to say that it turns out that the limit <expression> goes to <expression>  the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8229, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "now that looks practically the same as what we said before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to make sure that you understand when it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it works provided this is <expression> of these undefined expressions", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also we need <expression> more assumption", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the righthand side the righthand limit exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is practically the same thing as what i said over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i took the ratio of these functions <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i took their derivatives which is what i did right here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just differentiated them and i took the ratio", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is way easier than the quotient rule and is nothing like the quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont think quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont think quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we differentiate the numerator and denominator separately", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what im claiming over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take these functions i replace them with this ratio of derivatives and then i take the limit instead over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it turned out that the functions got much simpler when i differentiated them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i started with this messy object and i got this much easier object that i could easily evaluate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the big game thats happening here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it works if this limit makes sense and this limit exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats whats going to help us a little bit in a few examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me give you a couple of examples and then well go further", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> we have to understand how this <expression> works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8245, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 8246, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "this is another kind of example of a limit that we discussed in the <expression> part of the course", "entities": []}
{"text": "unfortunately now were reviewing stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this should reinforce what you did there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will be an easier way of thinking about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so by lhopitals rule so heres the step", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of the derivatives here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the limit was <expression> over there but now its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> is the same as the limit of the derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats easy to evaluate", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats a multiplication sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should just write this as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8261, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8263, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "but you know that thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how lhopitals method works", "entities": []}
{"text": "its pretty painless", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to give you another example which shows that it works a little better than the method that i started out with", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres what happens if we consider the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was a little harder to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again this is <expression> of these <expression> things near <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> tends to <expression> this goes to an indeterminate form here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now according to our method this is equivalent to now im going to use this little wiggle because i dont want to write limit limit limit limit a million times", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to use a little wiggle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as <expression> goes to <expression> this is going to behave the same way as differentiating numerator and denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this is going to be <expression> in the numerator", "entities": [{"id": 8274, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8275, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "in the denominator its going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8277, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 8278, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "now notice that we still havent won yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is still of <expression> type", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you plug in <equation> you still get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 8283, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "but that doesnt damage the method", "entities": []}
{"text": "that doesnt make the method fail", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> we can apply lhopitals rule a <expression> time", "entities": [{"id": 8292, "label": "method", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 45}, {"id": 8293, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and as <expression> goes to <expression> this is the same thing as again differentiating the numerator and denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i get <expression> in the numerator and i get <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8299, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 8300, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 43}, {"id": 8302, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 85}, {"id": 8303, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "again this is way easier than differentiating ratios of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "were only differentiating the numerator and the denominator separately", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression> this is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the justification for this comes only when you win in the end and get the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "because what the theorem says is that if <expression> of these limits exists then the preceding <expression> exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "and once the preceding <expression> exists then the <expression> before it exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once we know that this <expression> exists that works backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the logical structure here is a little subtle which is that if the right side exists then the left side will also exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "why does the righthand limit have to exist isnt it just the derivative that has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of the numerator has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of the denominator has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this limit has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "what doesnt have to exist by the way i never said that <expression> has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact its much much more subtle", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not claiming that <expression> exists because in order to evaluate this limit <expression> need not exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "what has to happen is that nearby for <expression> not  <expression> these things exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the limit has to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres no requirements that the limits exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact thats exactly going to be the point when we evaluate these limits here", "entities": []}
{"text": "is we dont have to evaluate it right at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question that youre asking is why is this the hypothesis of the theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words why does this work", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the answer is that this is a theorem thats true", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you drop this hypothesis its totally false", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you dont have this hypothesis you cant use the theorem and you will get the wrong answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its hard to express it any further than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so look in many cases we tell you formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in many cases its so obvious when theyre true that we dont have to worry about what we say", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed theres something implicit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im saying well you know if i wrote this symbol down it must mean that the thing exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a subtle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what im emphasizing is that you dont need to know in advance that this <expression> exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "you do need to know in advance that that <expression> exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "essentially yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the direction that it goes", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cant get away with not having this exist and still have the statement be true", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im getting a little ahead of myself but let me just say", "entities": []}
{"text": "nevertheless this theorem applies", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well be able to use it", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here as <expression> goes to <expression> neither of these well actually come to think of it <expression> if you like its  <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want to say that it has a value", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in fact these expressions dont necessarily have values", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "and nevertheless the theorem applies", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean it can exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "its perfectly ok for it to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "its no problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just doesnt need to exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "it isnt forced to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a calculation which we just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we evaluated this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want to make a comparison with the method of approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we would use <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we would use that linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what we would have here is that <expression> is approximately <expression> which is of course <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for this <expression> you have to remember the approximation near <equation> to the cosine function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now sure enough this simplifies", "entities": []}
{"text": "this becomes <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get the same answer which is a good thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "because both of these methods are valid", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre consistent", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see that neither of them is particularly a lot longer", "entities": []}
{"text": "you may have trouble remembering this property", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in fact its something that you can easily derive", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre almost the same amount of numerical content to them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what id like to do is explain to you why lhopitals rule works better in some cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the real value that it has is in handling these other more exotic limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now were going to do lhopitals rule over again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill handle these functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill have to rewrite them but well just do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the property", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the limit as <expression> goes to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the property", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is what well always be using", "entities": []}
{"text": "very convenient thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember it was true provided that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that the righthand side exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i claim that it works better and ill get rid of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill write them again to show you that it works for these", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are other cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other cases that are allowed are this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all as indicated by what i just erased you can allow <expression> to be  <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can take the limit going to the far ends of the universe", "entities": []}
{"text": "both left and right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other thing that you can do is you can allow <expression> and <expression> to be <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a very powerful tool and quite different from the other cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing is that the righthand side doesnt really quite have to exist in the ordinary sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats also ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats still information", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we can see where it goes then were still good", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it goes to <expression> if it goes to <expression> if it goes to a finite number if it goes to <expression> all of that will be ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just if it oscillates wildly that well be lost", "entities": []}
{"text": "and those calculations well never encounter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this basically handles everything that you could possibly hope for", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a very convenient process", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me carry out a few examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see i guess the <expression> <expression> that i wanted to do was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what example are we up to", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> was on our homework problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the limits of some calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but so this <expression> you have to look at it <expression> to think about what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an indeterminate form but it sort of looks like its the wrong type", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why is it in an indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> goes to <expression> and this <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so excuse me this is a product", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the product could be anything in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> step is to write this as a ratio of things rather than a product of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it turns out that the way to do that is to use the <expression> in the numerator and the <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a choice that im making here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now ive just converted it to a limit of the type <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the numerator is going to <expression> as <expression> goes to <expression> and the denominator <expression> is going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again theres a competitions but now its <expression> of the forms to which lhopitals rule applies", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im just going to apply lhopitals rule", "entities": [{"id": 8390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}, {"id": 8391, "label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "and what it says is that i differentiate here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just differentiate a numerator and denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8392, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 8393, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}, {"id": 8394, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "and now it just simplifies and were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> plus of well the <expression>s cancel", "entities": [{"id": 8398, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 59}, {"id": 8399, "label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "this is the same as just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> factors cancel", "entities": [{"id": 8402, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is that its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> goes to <expression> faster then <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> was the winner", "entities": []}
{"text": "something you cant necessarily predict in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do the other <expression> examples that i wrote down", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do them in slightly more generality because theyre the most fundamental rate properties that youre going to need to know for the next section", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is improper integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also theyre just very important for physical math and any other kind of thing basically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here lets just do these", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i wrote down the limit of <expression> but im going to make it even more general", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to make it any negative power here where <expression> is some positive constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "now again this is a product of functions not a quotient a ratio of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i need to rewrite it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8416, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and now thats the same as the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where does that go", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can decide", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> stays where it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this as <expression> goes to <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the conclusion is that <expression> grows more slowly then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember <expression> is positive here of course", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the increasing exponentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "not the decreasing ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do a variant of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it the opposite way", "entities": []}
{"text": "it really doesnt give us any more information but it gives you just a little bit more practice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose i look at things the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> divided by say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8434, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "now this is an <expression> example again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can work out what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there are <expression> ways of thinking about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the slow way and the fast way", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is right", "entities": []}
{"text": "apply lhopitals rule over and over and over and over again", "entities": [{"id": 8437, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"id": 8438, "label": "method", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "all the way", "entities": []}
{"text": "its clear that you could do it but its kind of a nuisance", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a much cleverer trick here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that <expression> is that this is the same as <expression> goes to <expression> of well its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our lhopitals step", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now again i did this in a slightly different way to show you that it works with infinity as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was this other case", "entities": []}
{"text": "the righthand side can exist or it can be <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that applies to this limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore to the original limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the conclusion here is that <expression> <expression> grows faster than any power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i picked <expression> but obviously it didnt matter what power i picked", "entities": []}
{"text": "the exponents beat all the powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression> more of the ones that i gave at the beginning to take care of", "entities": [{"id": 8455, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and that <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its behavior at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill do a slightly variant on that <expression> too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now this as <expression> goes to <expression> is of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <expression> and here i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when the dust settles here and you get your exponents right we have an <expression> and this is an <expression> and thats a <expression> becomes a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats  to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which we can decide", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the conclusion is that <expression> grows more slowly as <expression> goes to <expression> than <expression> or any positive power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so any <expression> <expression> positive will work", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is really slow going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its very very gradual", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is how many hypotheses do you need here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i said that and i think what you were asking is if i have this hypothesis can i also have this hypothesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can have this hypothesis combined with this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need something about <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cant assume nothing about <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words i have to be faced with either an <expression> or a <expression> situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "a rule applies in the <expression> or <expression> case", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the only <expression> cases that it applies in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a can be anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "including <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rule applies in these <expression> cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words this is what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "either <expression> of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact it can be plus or minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the righthand side has to be something", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has to be either finite or <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need something", "entities": []}
{"text": "you need a specific value of <expression> you need to decide whether its an indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you need the righthand limit to exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not hard to impose this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because when you look at the righthand side youll want to be calculating it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you want to know what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youll never have problems confirming this hypothesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give you <expression> more example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is just slightly trickier", "entities": []}
{"text": "which involves so heres another indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8510, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so there are lots of these things where you just dont know what to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they come out in various different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "the simplest example of this is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> from above of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order to work out whats happening with this <expression> we have to use a trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the trick is this is a moving exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so its appropriate to use base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is something that we did way back in the <expression> unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since we have a moving exponent were going to use base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the good base to use whenever you have a moving exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so rewrite this as <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8519, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and now in order to figure out whats happening we really only have to know whats going on with the exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember actually we already did this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to do it once more for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what we have here is that this <expression> is going to be equivalent to well its going to tend to what we got over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that exponent is what we want", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the answer this limit happens to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats actually relatively easy to do given all of the power that we have at our hands", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me give you <expression> more example", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose youre trying to understand the limit of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this as <expression> goes to <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand if you look at the linear approximation method linear approximation says that <expression> is approximately <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression> which goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression> at least from <expression> side <expression> to the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres something fishy going on here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is fishy", "entities": []}
{"text": "or maybe this is fishy i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so tell me whats wrong here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the claim is that the <expression> application of lhopitals rule this <expression> is wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where you have to watch out with lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is exactly where you have to watch out", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to apply the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "here its an indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> before i applied the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this <expression> isnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its no longer an indeterminate form", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually infinite", "entities": []}
{"text": "either <expression> or <expression> depending on the sign of the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is just what this answer is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the linear approximation is safe", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we just applied lhopitals rule wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the moral of the story here is look before you lhop", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me say <expression> more thing", "entities": [{"id": 8566, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "i need to pile it on just a little bit sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dont use it as a crutch", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont want to just get ourselves so weak after being in the hospital for all this time that we cant use im sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember that you shouldnt have lost your senses", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have something like this so well do this <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose youre trying to understand what this does as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you could lhopitals rule <expression> times or <expression> times", "entities": [{"id": 8572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 47}, {"id": 8573, "label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "and get the answer here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really you should realize that the main terms are sitting there right in front of you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that theres some algebra that you can do to simplify this", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely its the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the denominator well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would be dividing by <expression> in both numerator and denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8577, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 8578, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 59}, {"id": 8579, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "but thats ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the main term if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you like much more simply just <expression> is the main term", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dont forget your basic algebra when youre doing this kind of stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "use these things and dont use lhopitals rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok see you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me start by basically listing the main things we have learned over the past <expression> weeks or so", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will add a few complements of information about that because there are a few small details that i didnt quite clarify and that i should probably make a bit clearer especially what happened at the very end of yesterdays class", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is a list of things that should be on your review sheet for the exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> thing we learned about the main topic of this unit is about functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have learned how to think of functions of <expression> or <expression> variables in terms of plotting them", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular well not only the graph but also the contour plot and how to read a contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have learned how to study variations of these functions using partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8597, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "lets say you have <equation> this symbol means you differentiate with respect to <expression> treating <expression> as a constant", "entities": [{"id": 8601, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and we have learned how to package partial derivatives into a vector the gradient vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example lets say we have a function <equation> the vector whose components are the partial derivatives", "entities": [{"id": 8603, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and we have seen how to use the gradient vector or the partial derivatives to derive various things such as approximation formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "the change in <expression> when we change <expression> <expression> <expression> slightly is approximately  well there are several terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "rewrite <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8610, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "and in particular this approximation is called the tangent plane approximation because it tells us in fact it amounts to identifying the graph of the function with its tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "it means that we assume that the function depends more or less linearly on <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we set <equation> what we get is actually we are replacing the function by its linear approximation", "entities": [{"id": 8620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "we are replacing the graph by its tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "except of course we havent see the graph of a function of <expression> variables because that would live in <expression>dimensional space", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets draw the graph of <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8624, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "so when we think of a graph really it is a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "that also tells us how to find tangent planes to level surfaces", "entities": []}
{"text": "recall that the tangent plane to a surface given by the equation <equation> at a given point can be found by looking <expression> for its normal vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know that the normal vector is actually well <expression> normal vector is given by the gradient of a function because we know that the gradient is actually pointing perpendicularly to the level sets towards higher values of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it gives us the direction of fastest increase of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions about these topics", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me add actually a cultural note to what we have seen so far about partial derivatives and how to use them which is maybe something i should have mentioned a couple of weeks ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do we like partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> obvious reason is we can do all these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "but another reason is that really you need partial derivatives to do physics and to understand much of the world that is around you because a lot of things actually are governed by what is called partial differentiation equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you want a cultural remark about what this is good for", "entities": []}
{"text": "a partial differential equation is an equation that involves the partial derivatives of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have some function that is unknown that depends on a bunch of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a partial differential equation is some relation between its partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are equations involving the partial derivatives of an unknown function", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give you an example to see how that works", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is the equation well let me write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8632, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "it is the equation partial <expression>  some constant times the sum of the <expression> partials with respect to <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an equation where we are trying to solve for a function <expression> that depends actually on <expression> variables <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what should you have in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this equation governs temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you think that <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> will be the temperature at a point in space at position <expression> <expression> <expression> and at time <expression> then this tells you how temperature changes over time", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do we take the partial derivative twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that is a question i would say for a physics person", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in a few weeks we will actually see a derivation of where this equation comes from and try to justify it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really that is something you will see in a physics class", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason for that is basically physics of how heat is transported between particles in fluid or actually any medium", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells you how well the heat flows through the material that you are looking at", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i am giving it to you just to show you an example of a real life problem where in fact you have to solve <expression> of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "now how to solve partial differential equations is not a topic for this class", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you will see it is already quite hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you want more on that <expression> we have many fine classes about partial differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> thing at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted to point out to you that very often functions that you see in real life satisfy many nice relations between the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was in case you were wondering why on the syllabus for today it said partial differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have officially covered the topic", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is basically all we need to know about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we will come back to that a bit later", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will see", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "if there are no further questions let me continue and go back to my list of topics", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should have written down that this equation is solved by temperature for point <expression> <expression> <expression> at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are actually many other interesting partial differential equations you will maybe sometimes learn about the wave equation that governs how waves propagate in space about the diffusion equation when you have maybe a mixture of <expression> fluids how they somehow mix over time and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "basically to every problem you might want to consider there is a partial differential equation to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "back to my list of topics", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> important application we have seen of partial derivatives is to try to optimize things try to solve minimummaximum problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember that we have introduced the notion of critical points of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "a critical point is when all the partial derivatives are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there are various kinds of critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is maxima and there is minimum but there is also saddle points", "entities": []}
{"text": "set the right hand side to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8669, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 8670, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and plug in <equation> on the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8672, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 8673, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "and we have also seen that actually that is not enough to find the minimum of a maximum of a function because the minimum of a maximum could occur on the boundary", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is a point where the <expression> derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets graph <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8679, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and we used the <expression> derivative to see that this critical point is a local maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then when we are looking for the minimum of a function well it is not at a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is actually here at the boundary of the domain you know the range of values that we are going to consider", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the minimum is at the boundary", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the maximum is at a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we can use these methods to find where they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "or somewhere on the boundary of a set of values that are allowed", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be that we actually achieve a minimum by making <expression> and <expression> as small as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe letting them go to <expression> if they had to be positive or maybe by making them go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to keep our minds open and look at various possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are going to do a problem like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are going to go over a practice problem from the practice test to clarify this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i have some good news for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "while you should definitely know what this is about it will not be on the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "that doesnt mean that you should forget everything we have seen about it ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is next on my list of topics", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have seen differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember the differential of <expression> by definition would be this kind of quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <expression> it looks just like a new way to package partial derivatives together into some new kind of object", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is this good for", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is a good way to remember approximation formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is a good way to also study how variations in <expression> <expression> <expression> relate to variations in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular we can divide this by variations actually by <expression> or by <expression> or by <expression> in any situation that we want or by <expression> of some other variable to get chain rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "the chain rule says for example there are many situations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we can ask ourselves how sensitive is <expression> to a value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can answer that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the chain rule is something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we apply the chain rule to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 8708, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and let me explain to you again where this comes from", "entities": []}
{"text": "basically what this quantity means is if we change <expression> and keep <expression> constant what happens to the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well why would the value of <expression> change in the <expression> place when <expression> is just a <expression> <expression> <expression> and not directly of you", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it changes because <expression> <expression> and <expression> depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we have to figure out how quickly <expression> <expression> and <expression> change when we change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel out <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 8728, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 8729, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "and simplify the left hand side", "entities": [{"id": 8730, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 8731, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "how much does <expression> change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well partial <expression> over partial <expression> tells us how quickly <expression> changes if i just change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the change in <expression> caused just by the fact that <expression> changes when <expression> changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then <expression> also changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> changes at this rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that causes <expression> to change at that rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> changes as well and that causes <expression> to change at that rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the effects add up together", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in particular we can use the chain rule to do changes of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we have <equation> and finally last but not least we have seen how to deal <expression> with nonindependent <expression> variables", "entities": [{"id": 8762, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "of course on the exam you can be sure that i will make sure that you cannot solve for a variable you want to remove because that would be too easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "then when we have to look at all of them we will have to take into account this relation we have seen <expression> useful methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of them is to find the minimum of a maximum of a function when the variables are not independent and that is the method of lagrange multipliers", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember to find the minimum or the maximum of the function <expression> subject to the constraint <expression>  constant well we write down equations <equation> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 8769, "label": "command", "start_offset": 130, "end_offset": 135}]}
{"text": "there is a new variable here lambda the multiplier", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we dont have actually <expression> independent variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "we also have this relation whatever the constraint was relating <expression> <expression> and <expression> together", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we can try to solve this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and depending on the situation it is sometimes easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it sometimes it is very hard or even impossible", "entities": []}
{"text": "but on the test i havent decided yet but it could well be that the problem about lagrange multipliers just asks you to write the equations and not to solve them", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i dont know yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am not promising anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before you start solving check whether the problem asks you to solve them or not", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it doesnt then probably you shouldnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "another topic that we solved just yesterday is constrained partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we are in the same situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a function lets say <expression> <expression> <expression> where variables <expression> <expression> and <expression> are not independent but are constrained by some relation of this form", "entities": [{"id": 8821, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "some quantity involving <expression> <expression> and <expression>  maybe <expression> or some other constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i cannot keep all the other constant because that would not be compatible with this condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean that would be the usual or socalled formal partial derivative of <expression> ignoring the constraint", "entities": []}
{"text": "to take this into account means that if we vary <expression> variable while keeping another <expression> fixed then the <expression> <expression> since it depends on them must also change somehow", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we must take that into account", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say for example we want to find i am going to do a different example from yesterday", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you really didnt like that <expression> you dont have to see it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does that mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <expression> is constant <expression> varies and <expression> somehow is mysteriously a <expression> and <expression> for this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then of course because it depends on <expression> that means <expression> will vary", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry depends on <expression> and <expression> and <expression> varies", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we are asking ourselves what is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> in this situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we have <expression> methods to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "using differentials means that we will try to express <expression> in terms of <expression> in this particular situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do we know about <expression> in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the general statement", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course we are in a special case", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are in a special case where <expression> <expression> is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is constant means that we can set <expression> to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> thing is actually we dont care about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we need is to relate <expression> with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well to do that we need to look at how the variables are related so we need to look at the constraint <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we look at the differential <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> doesnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> doesnt change then we have a relation between <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in fact we say we are going to look only at the case where <expression> is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now we have a relation between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know how <expression> depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want this is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> when we keep <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "in our new terminology this is partial <expression> over partial <expression> with <expression> held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that will tell us that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is now <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this coefficient here is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> in the situation we are considering", "entities": []}
{"text": "this quantity is what we call partial <expression> over partial <expression> with <expression> held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is what we wanted to find", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets see another way to do the same calculation and then you can choose which <expression> you prefer", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other method is using the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "we use the chain rule to understand how <expression> depends on <expression> when <expression> is held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me <expression> try the chain rule brutally and then we will try to analyze what is going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can just use the version that i have up there as a template to see what is going on but i am going to explain it more carefully again", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the most mechanical and mindless way of writing down the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am just saying here that i am varying <expression> keeping <expression> constant and i want to know how <expression> changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> might change because <expression> might change <expression> might change and <expression> might change", "entities": []}
{"text": "now how quickly does <expression> change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the rate of change of <expression> in this situation is partial <expression> partial <expression> with <expression> held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i change <expression> at this rate then <expression> will change at that rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> might change so the rate of change of <expression> would be the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> holding <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "wait a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is held constant then <expression> doesnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually this guy is <expression> and you didnt really have to write that term", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i wrote it just to be systematic", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> had been somehow able to change at a certain rate then that would have caused <expression> to change at that rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course if <expression> is held constant then nothing happens here", "entities": []}
{"text": "finally while <expression> is changing at a certain rate this rate is this <expression> and that causes <expression> to change at that rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we add the effects together", "entities": []}
{"text": "see it is nothing but the goodold chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "just i have put these extra subscripts to tell us what is held constant and what isnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "now of course we can simplify it a little bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "because here how quickly does <expression> change if i am changing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the rate of change of <expression> with respect to itself is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact the really mysterious part of this is the <expression> here which is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to find that we have to understand the constraint", "entities": []}
{"text": "how can we find the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we could use differentials like we did here but we can also keep using the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "how can i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i can just look at how <expression> would change with respect to <expression> when <expression> is held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just do the same calculation with <expression> instead of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if <expression> is held constant then when we vary <expression> keeping <expression> constant and changing <expression> well <expression> still doesnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is held constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact that should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we just say that we are not going to get to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see how we can compute that using the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the chain rule tells us <expression> changes because <expression> <expression> and <expression> change", "entities": []}
{"text": "how does it change because of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how does it change because of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how quickly <expression> changes here of course is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can just write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 8991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and now we found how <expression> depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we plug that into that and we get our answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes all the way up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we get the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am not going to well i guess i can write it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was partial <expression> times this guy <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can observe that this is exactly the same formula that we had over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact lets compare this to make it side by side", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim we did exactly the same thing just with different notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> methods are pretty much the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "quick poll", "entities": []}
{"text": "who prefers this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "majority vote seems to be for differentials but it doesnt mean that it is better", "entities": []}
{"text": "both are fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can use whichever <expression> you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you should give both a try", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "i forgot to mention it", "entities": []}
{"text": "where did that go", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think i erased that part", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need to know directional derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is pretty much all we know about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other topics that i forgot to list", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think what we should do now is look quickly at the practice test", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean given the time you will mostly have to think about it yourselves", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you have a copy of the practice exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> problem is a simple problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "find an approximation formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you know how to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> problem is <expression> about writing a contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so before i let you go for the weekend i want to make sure that you actually know how to read a contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thing i should mention is this problem asks you to estimate partial derivatives by writing a contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have not done that so that will not actually be on the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will be doing qualitative questions like what is the sine of a partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it <expression> less than <expression> or more than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont need to bring a ruler to estimate partial derivatives the way that this problem asks you to", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets look at problem <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try and see what is going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "a point where <equation> well that should be probably on the level curve that says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can actually zoom in", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is the level <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want partial <expression> over partial <expression> to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means if i change <expression> keeping <expression> constant the value of <expression> doesnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "which points on the level curve satisfy that property", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is the top and the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you are here for example and you move in the <expression> direction well you see as you get to there from the left the height <expression> increases and then decreases", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes for a maximum at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at that point the partial derivative is <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means if we go north we should go down", "entities": []}
{"text": "well which <expression> is it top or bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "top", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "here if you go north then you go from <expression> down to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is where the point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the problem here was also asking you to estimate partial <expression> over partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you were curious how you would do that well you would try to figure out how long it takes before you reach the next level curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the change in height when you go from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you go down from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is actually <expression> exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <expression> is about <expression> well <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is an approximation for partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is how you would do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me go back to other things", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look at this practice exam basically there is a bit of everything and it is kind of fairly representative of what might happen on tuesday", "entities": []}
{"text": "there will be a mix of easy problems and of harder problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "expect something about computing gradients approximations rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "expect a problem about reading a contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean pretty much all the topics are going to be there", "entities": []}
{"text": "today were going to continue our discussion of methods of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "the method that im going to describe today handles a whole class of functions of the following form", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take <expression> and this is known as a rational function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all that means is that its a ratio off <expression> polynomials which are these functions <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well handle all such functions by a method which is known as partial fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what this does is it splits <expression> into what you could call easier pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats going to be some kind of algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what were going to spend most of our time doing today", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill start with an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of my examples will be illustrating more general methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats easy to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just we already know the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres the difficulty that is going to arise", "entities": []}
{"text": "the difficulty is that i can start with this function which is perfectly manageable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and than i can add these <expression> functions together", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way i add fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats getting a common denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope there arent too many more of those transformations", "entities": []}
{"text": "is there another <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh it happened earlier on", "entities": []}
{"text": "wow thats an interesting vibration there", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess my <expression>s were speaking to my <expression>s", "entities": []}
{"text": "somewhere in my past", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok anyway i think this is now correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the problem is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the problem with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this integral was easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "im calling it easy we already know how to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now over here its disguised", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same function but its no longer clear how to integrate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "if youre faced with this <expression> you say what am i supposed to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have to get around that difficulty", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what were going to do is were going to unwind this disguise", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the algebra problem that we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh wow", "entities": []}
{"text": "there must be something in the water", "entities": []}
{"text": "impressive", "entities": []}
{"text": "wow", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "holy cow", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats good", "entities": []}
{"text": "well ill keep you awake today with several other transpositions here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our algebra problem is to detect the easy pieces which are inside", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the method that were going to use the <expression> that well emphasize anyway is <expression> algebraic trick which is a shortcut which is called the coverup method", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were going to talk about even more general things than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway this is where were headed", "entities": []}
{"text": "is something called the coverup method", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats our intro", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill just have to remember that <expression> is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill keep on repeating that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now here im going to describe to you how we unwind this disguise", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> step is we write down the function we want to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "which was this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that factors we happen to know the factors so im not going to carry this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this can be a rather difficult step", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were going to assume that its done", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the purposes of illustration here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i factor the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the <expression> thing that im going to do is what im going to call the setup here", "entities": []}
{"text": "how im going to set things up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill tell you what these things are more systematically in a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the setup is that i want to somehow detect what i did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to write some unknowns here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now my <expression> step is going to be to solve for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im done if i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the complete unwinding of this disguise", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where the coverup method comes in handy", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is this method that im about to describe", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you can do the algebra in a clumsy way or you can do it in a quick way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and wed like to get efficient about the algebra involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the righthand side you get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9124, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}, {"id": 9125, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "the <expression>s cancel again", "entities": [{"id": 9128, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and then we get this extra term", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the trick here and were going to get even better trick in just a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the trick here is that i didnt try to clear the denominators completely", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was very efficient about the way i did it", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if i plug in now <equation> this term drops out too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do now is im going to plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "thats the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is my formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a happens to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats of course what i expect", "entities": []}
{"text": "a had better be <expression> because the thing broke up into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the correct answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was a question out here which i missed", "entities": []}
{"text": "arent polynomials defined as functions with whole powers or could they be square roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "are polynomials defined as functions with whole powers or can they be square roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is they only have whole powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for instance here i only have the power <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i have the powers <expression> <expression> and <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "square roots are no good for this method", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "why did i say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason why i said <equation> was that it works really fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cant know this in advance thats part of the method", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just turns out to be the best thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "the fastest way of getting at the coefficient a", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the curious thing let me just pause for a <expression> before i do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that seems like the most horrible thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "the worst possible thing to do is to set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9330, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "on the other hand what we did is a trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "we multiplied by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9333, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and that turned the equation into this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now in disguise i multiplied by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9335, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "but that turns out to be legitimate", "entities": []}
{"text": "because really this equation is true for all <expression> except <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then instead of taking <equation> i can really take <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats really what i need", "entities": []}
{"text": "the limit is <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the equation is still valid then", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im using the worst case the case that looks like its dividing by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the advantage here is this cancellation that occurs in this part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the method", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to shorten it much much more in a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me carry it out for the other coefficient as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the other coefficient im going to solve for <expression> im going to multiply by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9348, "label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "and then again the <expression>s cancel", "entities": [{"id": 9352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "so i get <expression> sitting alone", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to do the same trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "thats the value which is going to knock out this <expression> term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we get here all told is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <equation> which was also what it was supposed to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> was this number <expression> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which im now not going to change to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i know that its not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is the method which is called coverup", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its really carried out much much faster than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to review the method and im going to show you what it is in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> step is to factor the denominator <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9365, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 37}, {"id": 9366, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "thats what i labeled <expression> over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was the factorization of the denominator up top", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> step is what im going to call the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats where i knew what i was aiming for in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to have to explain to you in every instance exactly what this setup should be", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is what the unknowns should be and what target simplified expression were aiming for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the <expression> step is what ill now call coverup", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is just a very fast way of doing what i did on this last board which is solving for the unknown coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now let me perform it for you again", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "handwriting it makes it much faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright thats the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i claim that without writing very much i can figure out what <expression> and <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"text": "just by staring at this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what im going to do is im just going to think what i did over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im just going to do it directly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me show you what the method consists of visually", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to cover up that is knock out this factor and focus on this number here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to plug in the thing that makes the <expression> which is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im plugging in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9378, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "to this lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i get is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats the same thing i did over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just did it by skipping the intermediate algebra step which is a lot of writing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the coverup method really amounts to the following thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "im thinking of multiplying this over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it cancels this and it gets rid of everything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to get rid of it on this side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words by eliminating this im isolating a on the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the coverup is that im covering this and getting <expression> out of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly i can do the same thing with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its focused on the value <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is what im getting on the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to cover up this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i cover up that then whats left over with <equation> is again <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the way the method gets carried out in practice", "entities": []}
{"text": "writing essentially the least you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when you get to several variables it becomes just way more convenient to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now let me just review when coverup works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this coverup method works if <expression> has distinct linear factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you need <expression> things here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has to factor completely the denominator has to factor completely", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the degree of the numerator has to be strictly less than the degree of the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to give you an example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for instance and this tells you the general pattern of the setup also", "entities": []}
{"text": "say you had <expression> lets say", "entities": [{"id": 9390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "over <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9392, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "so here im going to tell you the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it will always break up into something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so however many factors you have youll have to put in a term for each of those", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you can find each number here by this coverup method", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were done with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have to go on to the algebraic complications", "entities": []}
{"text": "so would the <expression> typical algebraic complication be", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be repeated roots or repeated factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me get <expression> that doesnt come out to be extremely ugly here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is going to work when the degree you always need that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> has now repeated linear factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see which example i wanted to show you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just give this here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just repeat the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "with an extra factor like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the main thing you need to know since ive already performed the factorization for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to factor things all the way and thats already been done for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres what this setup is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the setup is that its of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need another term for the square here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in general if you have more powers you just need to keep on putting in those powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "why does it have to be squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why in the world am i doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just give you <expression> hint as to why im doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example the number <expression> is <expression> is that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this sort of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im getting this power and this power", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i have higher powers im going to have to have more and more", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what happens when i have a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to represent things like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats coming out of this piece with the repetitious here", "entities": []}
{"text": "of the powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just an analogy", "entities": []}
{"text": "of what were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an example but its meant to represent the general case and i will also give you a general picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "for sure once you have the <expression> power here youll need both the <expression> and the <expression> power mentioned over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since theres only a <expression> power over here i only have to mention a <expression> power over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this were a <expression> here there would be <expression> more term which would be the <expression> for <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what you just said", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now whats different about this setup is that the coverup method although it works it doesnt work so well", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt work quite as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "the coverup works for the coefficients <expression> and <expression> not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well have a quick method for the numbers <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to figure out what they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it will be a little slower to get to <expression> which we will do last", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me show you how it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all im going to do the ordinary coverup with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for <expression> i just want to do the same old thing that i did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cover up this and thats going to get rid of all the junk except for the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to plug <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9425, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and i get <expression> sorry i get <expression> in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 9429, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 9430, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "remember im covering this up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats all there is on the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the righthand side all there is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> over here canceled", "entities": [{"id": 9435, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "this is the shortcut that i just described and this is much faster than doing all that arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all together this is a <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the other <expression> which is easy to do im going to do by the slow method <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you omit a term", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea is to cover up the other bad factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "cover ups ill do it both the way and the slow way", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it the fast way <expression> and then ill show you the slow way", "entities": []}
{"text": "the fast way is to cover this up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to cover up everything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gets eliminated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that includes everything but <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression> on this side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get <expression> on that side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was pretty fast so let me show you what arithmetic was hiding behind that", "entities": []}
{"text": "what algebra was hiding behind it", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i was really doing is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice again i cleared out that <expression> this term from the denominator and sent it over to the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats happening is that when i set <equation> here this term is dying", "entities": [{"id": 9452, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "this term is going away because theres more powers in the numerator than in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is still <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> is gone also", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all thats left is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i cannot pull that off with a single power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i can multiply through by this thing squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "its useless", "entities": []}
{"text": "which i cant use", "entities": []}
{"text": "again the coverup method is giving us <expression> and <expression> not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for the last term for <expression> im going to just have to be straightforward about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so ill just suggest for <expression> plug in your favorite number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so plug in my favorite number", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the <expression> numbers weve already used are <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we havent used <equation> yet so thats good", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to plug in now <equation> into the equation", "entities": [{"id": 9476, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression>  lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "a is the thing that i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> so <equation> so thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont give up at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a lot of algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "you really have to plug in all these numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "you make <expression> arithmetic mistake and youre always going to get the wrong answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is very arithmetically intensive", "entities": []}
{"text": "however it does simplify at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve weve simplified our function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now its easy to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is if <equation> has already been used what do i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is pick something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you said pick a random number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats right except that if you really picked a random number it would be <expression> which would be difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "what you want to pick is the easiest possible number you can think of", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you had as in this sort of situation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "more powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "wouldnt you have more variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "very good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats absolutely right", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we started with in the previous problem was <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as the degree of the denominator goes up the number of variables goes up", "entities": []}
{"text": "it gets more and more and more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "more and more arithmetically intensive", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is how would you solve it if you have <expression> unknowns", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly the point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a system of simultaneous equations for unknowns", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have little tricks for isolating single variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "otherwise were stuck with solving the whole system", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youd have to solve the whole system by elimination various other tricks", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill say a little more about that later", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i have to get <expression> step more complicated with my next example", "entities": []}
{"text": "my next example is going to have a quadratic factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so still im sticking to the degree of the polynomial and the numerator is less than the degree of the polynomial in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to take the case where <expression> has a quadratic factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just again illustrate this by example", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill make it about as easy as they come", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the setup will be slightly different here", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "its already factored", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive already done as much as i can do", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you know about complex numbers this method becomes much easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it comes back to the coverup method", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the way that the coverup method was originally conceived by heavy side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well wait", "entities": []}
{"text": "this by the way is a method which is used for integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it was invented to do something with laplace transforms and inversion of certain kinds of differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "by heavy side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so it came much later than integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway its a very convenient method", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the set up with this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "its now going to be a <expression> degree polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> degree down from the quadratic here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to know that in advance based on the pattern that you see on the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is if the degree of the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to have to do something totally different to handle it", "entities": []}
{"text": "which turns out fortunately to be much easier than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well deal with that at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "keep this in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an easy way to make a mistake if you start with a higher degree numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll never get the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now so i have my setup now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what can i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i claim that i can still do coverup for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cover this guy up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i really multiply by it it would knock everything out but <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10251, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so i cover this up and i plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 9511, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "so i get here <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again coverup is pretty fast as you can see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not too bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "now at this next stage i want to find <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the best idea is the slow way", "entities": []}
{"text": "here its not too terrible", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its just what were going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is to clear the denominators completely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for <expression> and <expression> just clear the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means multiply through by that whole business", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i got rid of the whole denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the righthand side when i bring this up the <expression> will cancel with this", "entities": [{"id": 10253, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 71}, {"id": 10254, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and the <expression> term will have a remaining factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the <expression> will cancel", "entities": [{"id": 9525, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "again the arithmetic here is not too terrible", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to do the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to look at the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the lefthand side and the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that will give me <expression> equation for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to do the same thing with another term", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> term on the lefthand side the coefficient is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other side its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember i actually have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to put it in its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the only other <expression> is when this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> so this is the other coefficient on <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that forces <expression> to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and last of all im going to do the <expression> power term", "entities": []}
{"text": "or otherwise known as the constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the lefthand side the constant term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is no constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the righthand side theres a constant term <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres another constant term which is this constant times this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the conclusion here is that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres also an <expression> power hidden in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry an <expression>  thats what you were asking about sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres also an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only reason why i didnt go to the <expression> is that it turns out with these <expression> i didnt need it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other thing is that by experience i know that the extreme ends of the multiplication are the easiest ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the middle terms have tons of cross terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i dont like the middle term as much because it always involves more arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i stick to the lowest and the highest terms if i can", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was really a sneaky thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did that without saying anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "another good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "could i just set  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10255, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "absolutely", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact thats equivalent to picking out the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could plug in numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you wanted", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats another way of doing this besides doing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can also plug in numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "can plug in numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually not <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "not <expression> just because weve already used it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wont get interesting information out", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is could i have done it this other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "with the polynomial with this other <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes absolutely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words what ive taught you now is <expression> choices which are equally reasonable", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> that i picked was the <expression> that was the fastest for this guy and the <expression> that was fastest for this <expression> but i couldve done the other way around", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are a lot of ways of solving simultaneous equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now everybody can understand the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this instead of being <expression> this were <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an important case to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a case in which this denominator is not fully factored", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its an <expression> you would have to factor out an <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9573, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "so that would be a situation like this you have an <expression> but thats <expression> this kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "if thats the right there must be a minus sign in here maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "isnt that what it isi think its right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway the point is that you have to factor it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have a linear and a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre always going to be faced eventually with linear factors and quadratic factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a cubic that means you havent factored sufficiently", "entities": []}
{"text": "once weve completed the factorization were going to have to deal with these <expression> factors as denominators", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats eventually going to happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "but hold on to that idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me carry out <expression> more example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive figured out what all the values are", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think its also worth it to remember now that we also have to carry out the integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "what ive just shown you is that the integral of <expression> is  to and ive split up into these pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are the pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "the pieces are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so wed better remember that we know how to antidifferentiate these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words i want to finish the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "the others were pretty easy so i didnt bother to finish my sentence but here i want to be careful and have you realize that theres something a little more to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all we have the the <expression> <expression> is no problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> actually is not too bad either", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is by the advanced guessing method my favorite method something like the logarithm because thats whats going to appear in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if you differentiate this youre going to get <expression> over this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so altogether its <expression> of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i fixed the coefficient here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the last <expression> you have to think back to some level of memorization here and remember that this is <expression> the arc tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "why did i go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because in disguise for this guy i was thinking <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was what i applied", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to save the general pattern for next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i do want to clarify <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets handle this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if the degree of <expression> is bigger than or  the degree of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the thing that i claimed was easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to describe to you how its done", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in analogy with numbers you might call this an improper fraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the thing that should echo in your mind when youre thinking about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im just going to do it by example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": " i cooked up an example so that i dont make an arithmetistic mistake along the way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are <expression> or <expression> steps that i need to explain", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "the denominators degree <expression> the numerator is degree <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it well exceeds so theres a problem here", "entities": []}
{"text": "our method is not going to work", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is i dont want the factorization for what im going to do next", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want it multiplied out", "entities": []}
{"text": "im back to the starting place here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the next thing that im going to do is im going to use long division", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how you convert an improper fraction to a proper fraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres how it works in the case of polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of amusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is thats going to match the top terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the product", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i subtract", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it cancels", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i need to divide this next term in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i need <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i subtract", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression>s cancel", "entities": [{"id": 9620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and here i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this thing has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is called the quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this thing also has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is called the remainder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now ill show you how it works by sticking it into the answer here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the quotient is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the remainder is lets get down there", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the punchline here is that this thing is easy to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> you can use now you can use coverup the method that we had before", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the degree of the numerator is now below the degree of the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "its now <expression> degree and this is <expression> degree", "entities": []}
{"text": "what you cant do is use coverup to start out with here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will give you the wrong answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the end for today and see you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so basically the last few weeks weve been doing derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok so more precisely we are going to be talking about double integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the picture is something like you have <expression> you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when we say the area of this region of course if <expression> is positive thats what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is negative then we count negatively the area below the <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now when you have a function of <expression> variables then you can try to do the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely you can plot its graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "its graph will be a surface in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we can try to look for the volume below the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we will call the double integral of the function over a certain region", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets say that we have a function of <expression> variables <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9645, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "then well look at the volume thats below the graph <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets draw a picture for what this means", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can draw its graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "the graph will be the surface with equation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well i have to decide where i will integrate the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for that i will choose some region in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will integrate the function on that region", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its over a region <expression> in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have this region <expression> and i look at the piece of the graph that is above this region", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well try to compute the volume of this solid here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats what the double integral will measure", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well call that the double integral of our region <expression> of <expression> and i will have to explain what the notation means", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well its a double integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well have to indicate somehow the region over which we are integrating", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well come up with more concrete notations when we see how to actually compute these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the basic definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so actually how do we define it thats not really much of a definition yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we actually define this rigorously", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then for each little piece you take the value of a function and you multiply by the width of a piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives you a rectangular slice and then you sum all of these rectangular slices together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here well do the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well let me put a picture up and explain what it does", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to cut our origin into little pieces say little rectangles or actually anything we want", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives us an estimate of a volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually what we do oh i still have a board here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and then well have each small piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "each small piece will have area <expression> and it will be at some point lets call it <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and then so what i do is actually i take the limit as the size of the pieces tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have more and more smaller and smaller pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that gives me the double integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats not a very good sentence but whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok so thats the definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course we will have to see how to compute it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont actually compute it", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you compute an integral in single variable calculus you dont do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont cut into little pieces and sum the pieces together", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve learned how to integrate functions using various formulas and similarly here well learn how to actually compute these things without doing that cutting into small pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so well have to learn which tricks work and how exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "but so what well do actually is well reduce the calculation of a double integral to <expression> calculations of single integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so yeah thats a strong suggestion that if youve forgotten everything about single variable calculus now would be a good time to actually brush up on integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "the usual integrals and the usual substitution tricks and easy trig in particular these would be very useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so yeah how do we compute these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what we would have to come up with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we are going to do is instead of cutting into a lot of small boxes like that and summing completely at random we will actually somehow scan through our region by parallel planes ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me put up actually a slightly different picture up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do is im going to take planes say in this picture parallel to the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill take a moving plane that scans from the back to the front or from the front to the back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now in each slice well i get what looks a lot like a single variable integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and that integral will tell me what is the area in this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when i add all of these areas together as the value of <expression> changes i will get the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok let me try to explain that again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to compute this integral what we do is actually we take slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so on the picture <expression> is just the area of this thing in the vertical wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you sum all of these well why does that work", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you take the origin between <expression> parallel slices that are very close to each other whats the volume in these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its essentially <expression> times the thickness of this very thin slice and the thickness would be <expression> if you take a limit with more and more slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we would have to start at the very lowest value of <expression> that ever happens in our origin and wed have to go all the way to the very largest value of <expression> from the very far back to the very far front", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this picture we probably start over here at the back and wed end over here at the front", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now its an integral of the variable <expression> because when we look at this slice what changes from left to right is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well let me actually write that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "for a given <expression> the area <expression> you can compute as an integral of <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well now <expression> is a constant and <expression> will be the variable of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the range for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its from the leftmost point here to the rightmost point here on the given slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is a big catch here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a very important thing to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the range of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "the range of integration for <expression> depends actually on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see if i take the slice thats pictured on that diagram then the range for y goes all the way from the very left to the very right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i take a slice that say near the very front then in fact only a very small segment of it will be in my region", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the range of values for <expression> will be much less", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember we fix <expression> so sorry so we fix a value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and for a given value of <expression> what we will do is well slice our graph by this plane parallel to the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we mention the graph is sitting above that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats the region <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have the region <expression> and i have the graph of a function above this region <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im trying to find the area between this segment and the graph above it in this vertical plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "well to do that i have to integrate from <expression> going from here to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want the area of a piece that sits above this red segment", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and so this is called an iterated integral because we iterate twice the process of taking an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "which range of <expression> do i want to look at to take my red slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is i would go all the way from here thats my <expression> slice to somewhere here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my last slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "for any value in between these i will have some red segment and i will want to integrate over that that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i think we should do lots of examples to convince ourselves and see how it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah its called an iterated integral because <expression> we integrated over <expression> and then we integrate again over <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is more complicated is how the bounds on <expression> depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well see that on an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for <expression> im using the range of values for <expression> that corresponds to the given value of <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember this is just like a plot in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "above that we have the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should draw a picture here instead", "entities": []}
{"text": "for a given value of <expression> so thats a given slice i have a range of values for <expression> that is from this picture at the leftmost point on that slice to the rightmost point on that slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where start and where i stop depends on the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok no more questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do our <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that we want to integrate the <expression> over the region defined by <expression> between <expression> and <expression> and <expression> between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9766, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 9767, "label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "so what does that mean geometrically", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <equation> and its a variation on actually i think we plotted that <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we saw that the graph is this paraboloid pointing downwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok its what you get by taking a parabola and rotating it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what well do is well so see here i try to represent the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here of course setting up the bounds will be easy because no matter what <expression> i take <expression> still goes from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see its easiest to do double integrals what the region is just a rectangle on the <expression> plane because then you dont have to worry too much about what are the ranges", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that would be the integral from <expression> to <expression> of the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im dropping the parentheses", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you still want to see them im going to put that in very thin so that you see what it means", "entities": []}
{"text": "but actually the convention is we wont put this parentheses in there anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what this means is <expression> i will integrate <expression> ranging from <expression> to <expression> with <expression> held fixed", "entities": [{"id": 9800, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "so what that represents is the area in this slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so see here ive drawn well what happens is actually the function takes positive and negative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact i will be counting positively this part of the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will be counting negatively this part of the area i mean as usual when i do an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what i will do to evaluate this i will <expression> do whats called the inner integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to do the inner integral well its pretty easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do i integrate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it becomes so whats the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just anything to remember is we are integrating this with respect to <expression> not to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the integral of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so when you plug <equation> you will get <expression> minus well for <equation> you get <expression> <expression> <expression> so nothing changes", "entities": [{"id": 9818, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 9819, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "ok so you are left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and thats a <expression> only", "entities": []}
{"text": "here you shouldnt see any <expression>s anymore because <expression> was your integration variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you still have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you still have <expression> because the area of this shaded slice depends of course on the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now the <expression> thing to do is to do the outer integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we integrate from <expression> to <expression> what we got which is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9831, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "ok and we know how to compute that because that integrates to <expression> between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill let you do the computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will find its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the final answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the general pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we have a double integral to compute <expression> we want to set it up carefully", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to find what will be the bounds in <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here that was actually pretty easy because our equation was very simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we want to compute the inner integral and then we compute the outer integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so by the way we started with <expression> in the notation right", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we had <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that somehow became a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> became <expression> because when we do the iterated integral this way what were actually doing is that we are slicing our origin into small rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok that was the area of this small rectangle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its the product of its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually its not just becomes its really ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the small rectangles for", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats a question of in which order we do the iterated integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "its up to us to decide whether we want to integrate <expression> <expression> then <expression> or <expression> <expression> then <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9855, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "but as well see very soon that is an important decision when it comes to setting up the bounds of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "here it doesnt matter but in general we have to be very careful about in which order we will do things", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in principle it always works both ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes it will be that because the region has a strange shape you can actually set it up more easily <expression> way or the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes it will also be that the function here you actually know how to integrate in <expression> way but not the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the theory is that it should work both ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that what i wanted to know was not actually what i computed namely the volume below the paraboloid but also the negative of some part thats now in the corner towards me", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should stop integrating where my paraboloid hits the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw another picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are going to do the same function but over a different region", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the region will just be now this quarter disk here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats your region <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in principle it will be the same integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what changes is the bounds", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do the bounds change", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok on that picture here on this picture it tells me for a fixed value of <expression> the range of values for <expression> should go only from here to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats from here to less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so for a given <expression> the range of <expression> is well so whats the lowest value of <expression> that we want to look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "its still <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from <equation> to whats the value of <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have to solve in the equation of a circle ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if im here this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i will integrate from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you see how the bound from y will depend on the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so while i erase i will let you think about what is the bound for <expression> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a trick question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we said for a fixed value of <expression> the range for <expression> is from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the range for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the range for <expression> should just be numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok remember the question i have to ask now is if i look at all of these yellow slices which <expression> is the <expression> <expression> that i will consider", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will get smaller and smaller and smaller slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it stops", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to stop when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "afterwards theres nothing else to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> goes from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and now see how in the inner integral the bounds depend on in the inner integral the bounds depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the question is if i fix a given <expression> if i look at a given slice whats the range for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the question is whats the <expression> slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the last slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "everyone happy with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok very good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now how do we compute that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we do the inner integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well that integrates to <expression> from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that becomes well the root of <expression> root of <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually if you look at it for long enough see this says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually thats also so in fact that simplifies to <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok let me redo that maybe slightly differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9928, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so i dont subtract anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now you see this is <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "the outer integral is the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well i let you see if you remember single variable integrals by trying to figure out what this actually comes out to be is it <expression> or <expression> actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well i guess we have to do it then", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wrote something on my notes but its not very clear ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we compute this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we have to do trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the only way i know to compute an integral like that ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well set <equation> and then <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 9944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "we are using <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that will become so <expression> remains <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> to the <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well if <expression> is <expression> then <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well if you do things with substitution which is the way i do them then you should worry about the bounds for theta which will be <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you can also just plug in the bounds at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now you have the <expression> times the integral from <expression> to p<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do you integrate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you have to use double angle formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> remember <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want the <expression> of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that will give us of well well have its actually <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how will you handle this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "well using again the double angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its getting slightly nasty", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you do again the double angle formula i think im not going to bother to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim you will get at the end <expression> because i say so", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so exercise continue calculating and get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now what does the show us", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this shows us actually that this is probably not the right way to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the right way to do this will be to integrate it in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we will learn how to do tomorrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we will actually see how to do it with much less trig", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that will be easier in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we will see that tomorrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so we are almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean here you just use a double angle again and then you can get it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "say we have an integral given to us in the order <expression> we can switch it to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we have to be extremely careful with the bounds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that cannot work", "entities": []}
{"text": "its more complicated than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "certainly if i do integral from <expression> to <expression> integral from <expression> to <expression> there i can certainly switch the bounds without thinking too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the reason for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the reason for that is this corresponds in both cases to integrating <expression> from <expression> to <expression> and <expression> from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i slice it this way you see that <expression> goes from <expression> to <expression> for any <expression> between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i slice it that way then <expression> goes from <expression> to <expression> for any value of <expression> between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general i have to draw picture of my region and see how the slices look like both ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do a more interesting <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why did i choose this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the guy because as far as i can tell theres no way to integrate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an integral that you cannot compute this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a good example for why this can be useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you do it this way you are stuck immediately", "entities": []}
{"text": "so instead we will try to switch the order", "entities": []}
{"text": "but to switch the order we have to understand what do these bounds mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets draw a picture of the region", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what i am saying is <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets draw <equation> and <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 10012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "well maybe i should actually put this here <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and so i will go for each value of <expression> i will go from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well do that for values of <expression> that go from <equation> to <equation> which happens to be exactly where these things intersect", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my region will consist of all this ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now if i want to do it the other way around i have to decompose my region", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other way around i have to so my goal now is to rewrite this as an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its still the same function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its still <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now i want to integrate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do i integrate over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i fix a value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for that value of <expression> whats the range of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the range for <expression> is from here to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok whats the value of <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets start with an easy <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> goes from <expression> to <expression> and then what about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have to start at the bottom of my region", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation> to the top which is at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> goes from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so switching the bounds is not completely obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "that took a little bit of work", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now that weve done that well just to see how it goes its actually going to be much easier to integrate because the inner integral well whats the integral of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that will be well if i plug <equation> i will get <expression> if i plug <equation> i will get <expression> into the <expression> ok", "entities": [{"id": 10052, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}, {"id": 10053, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "so now if i do the outer integral i will have the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that <expression> actually is a little bit easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know how to integrate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont quite know how to integrate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theres a product rule thats <expression> times the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats almost what we want except we have a <expression> instead of a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need to add <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10067, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and i claim thats the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok if you got lost you can also integrate by integrating by parts by taking the derivative of <expression> and integrating these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "or but you know that works", "entities": []}
{"text": "just your <expression> guess would be maybe lets try <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the derivative of that compare see what you need to do to fix", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if you take that between <expression> and <expression> youll actually get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so tomorrow we are going to see how to do double integrals in polar coordinates and also applications of double integrals how to use them for interesting things", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the last video i introduced you to the idea of the chain rule with partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the last video i didnt prove it to you but i hopefully gave you a little bit of intuition that you can believe me", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe <expression> day ill prove it a little bit more rigorously but you can find proofs on the web if you are interested for the chain rule with partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets put that aside and lets explore another property of partial derivatives and then were ready to get the intuition behind exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "because youre going to find its fairly straightforward to solve exact equations but the intuition is a little bit more well i dont want to say its difficult because if you have the intuition you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what if i had say this function <expression> and i were to take the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10090, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "ill just write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10092, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and then i were to take the partial derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just as a notation this you could write as you could kind of view it as youre multiplying the operators so it could be written like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial <expression> or <expression> <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that can also be written as and this is my preferred notation because it doesnt have all this extra junk everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could just say well the partial we took the partial with respect to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this just means the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we took the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> situation to consider", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens when we take the partial with respect to <expression>x and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so with respect to <expression> you hold <expression> constant to get just the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you hold the <expression> constant and you take the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the difference between that and if we were to switch the order", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just the notation just so youre comfortable with it that would be so partial <expression> partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it might be a little confusing that here between these <expression> notations even though theyre the same thing the order is mixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just because its just a different way of thinking about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this says ok partial <expression> with respect to <expression> then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this views it more as the operator so we took the partial of <expression> <expression> and then we took <expression> like youre multiplying the operators", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway so this can also be written as the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> sorry the partial of <expression> and then we took the partial of that with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our domain", "entities": []}
{"text": "if both of these functions are continuous if both of the <expression> partials are continuous then these <expression> are going to be  each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "now we can use this knowledge which is the chain rule using partial derivatives and this knowledge to now solve a certain class of differential equations <expression> order differential equations called exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what does an exact equation look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "an exact equation looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the color pickings the hard part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say this is my differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have some <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i dont know it could be <expression> or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know it could be any <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus some <expression> and <expression> well call that <expression> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 10148, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "this is well i dont know if its an exact equation yet but if you saw something of this form your <expression> impulse should be oh well actually your very <expression> impulse is is this separable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you should try to play around with the algebra a little bit to see if its separable because thats always the most straightforward way", "entities": []}
{"text": "if its not separable but you can still put it in this form you say hey is it an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well look immediately", "entities": []}
{"text": "this pattern right here looks an awful lot like this pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if <expression> was the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what if this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just saying we dont know for sure right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were just saying what if", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this right here the left side right there thats the same thing as this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the derivative of psi with respect to x using the partial derivative chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could rewrite it", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could rewrite this is just the <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 10163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so if you see a differential equation and it has this form and you say boy i cant separate it but maybe its an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and frankly if that was what was recently covered before the current exam it probably is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you see this form you say boy maybe its an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the partial of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if you could write it like this and you take the derivative of both sides sorry you take the antiderivative of both sides and you would get <equation> as a solution", "entities": [{"id": 10169, "label": "command", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 97}, {"id": 10170, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 116}, {"id": 10171, "label": "method", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 130}]}
{"text": "so there are <expression> things that we should be caring you about", "entities": []}
{"text": "then you might be saying ok sal youve walked through psis and partials and all this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> how do i know that its an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way to figure out is it an exact equation is to use this information right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said this is the partial with respect to <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is an exact equation if this is the exact equation if we were take the partial of this with respect to <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were to take the <expression> so the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were to take the partial of those with respect to <expression> so we could just rewrite that as that then that should be  the <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we take the partial with respect to <expression> of both of these we know from this that these should be  if <expression> and its partials are continuous over that domain", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then this will also be ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is actually the test to test if this is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me rewrite all of that again and summarize it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you see something of the form <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you take the <expression> and then you take the <expression> and they are  to each other then and its actually if and only if so it goes both ways this is an exact equation an exact differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if its an exact equation that tells us that there exists a <expression> such that the <equation> or <equation> is a solution of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill show you in the next video how to actually use this information to solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here are some things i want to point out", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be the <expression> but when we take the kind of exact test we take it with respect to <expression> because we want to get that mixed derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i know that might be a little bit involved but if you understood everything i did i think youll have the intuition behind why the methodology of exact equations works", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what does that mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that were now going to start involving the <expression> derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> class that im going to show you and this is probably the most useful class when youre studying classical physics are linear <expression> order differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its something that looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what makes it linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now before we start trying to solve this generally well do a special case of this where <expression> <expression> <expression> are constants and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what will that look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can just rewrite that as <expression> so now <expression> is not a function anymore its just a number <expression> times the <expression> derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> plus <expression> times the <expression> derivative <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10241, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 10242, "label": "command", "start_offset": 199, "end_offset": 203}, {"id": 10243, "label": "command", "start_offset": 217, "end_offset": 222}, {"id": 10244, "label": "command", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"text": "and this <expression> is called homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i havent made the connection yet on how these <expression> order differential equations are related to the <expression> order ones that i just introduced to these other homogeneous differential equations i introduced you to", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think they just happen to have the same name even though theyre not that related", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the reason why this <expression> is called homogeneous is because you have it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what makes it homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i do see more of a connection between this type of equation and milk where all the fat is spread out because if you think about it the solution for all homogeneous equations when you kind of solve the equation they always  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theyre homogenized i guess is the best way that i can draw any kind of parallel", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could call this a <expression> order linear because <expression> <expression> and <expression> definitely are functions just of well theyre not even functions of <expression> or <expression> theyre just constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> order linear homogeneous because they  <expression> differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think youll see that these in some ways are the most fun differential equations to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually often the most useful because in a lot of the applications of classical mechanics this is all you need to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theyre the most fun to solve because they all boil down to algebra ii problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill touch on that in a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just think about this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "think about what the properties of these solutions might be", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just throw out something", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that <expression> is a solution", "entities": [{"id": 10290, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so that means that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "these mean the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "now my question to you is what if i have some constant times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that still a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my question is lets say some constant <expression> <expression> is this a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets try it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see whether this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could factor out that <expression> constant and we get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10307, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and lo and behold we already know", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we know that <expression> is a solution we know that this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <expression> is a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is <expression> <expression> is going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10315, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "or another way to view it is that if <expression> is a solution to this <expression> order linear homogeneous differential equation then some constant times <expression> is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is also a solution to the differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the next property i want to show you and this is all going someplace dont worry", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next question i want to ask you is ok we know that <expression> is a solution to the differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if i were to also tell you that <expression> is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my question to you is is <expression> a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well have <expression> times the <expression> derivative of this thing", "entities": [{"id": 10329, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "well thats straightforward enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just <expression> the <expression> derivative of this thing <expression> times this function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what can we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets distribute all of these constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <expression> times the <expression> derivative of <expression> plus <expression> times the <expression> derivative of <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10342, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 10343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 93}, {"id": 10344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "and now we can rearrange them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve shown that this whole expression  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <expression> is a solution of the differential equation of this <expression> order linear homogeneous differential equation and <expression> is also a solution then if you were to add them together the sum of them is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in general if we show that <expression> is a solution and <expression> is a solution you can add them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we showed before that any constant times them is also a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe the constant in <expression> of the cases is <expression> or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway these are useful properties to maybe internalize for <expression> order homogeneous linear differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the next video were actually going to apply these properties to figure out the solutions for these", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll see that theyre actually straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would say a lot easier than what we did in the previous <expression> order homogeneous difference equations or the exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is much much easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "today im going to continue the idea of setting up integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what well deal with is volumes by slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "by slicing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its lucky that this is after lunch", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its after breakfast for some of you because theres the typical way of introducing this subject is with a food analogy", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a lot of ways of slicing up food", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well give a few more examples than just this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but suppose you have well suppose you have a loaf of bread here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our loaf of bread and i hope that looks a little bit like a loaf of bread", "entities": []}
{"text": "its supposed to be sitting on the kitchen counter ready to be eaten", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to figure out how much bread there is there <expression> way of doing it is to cut it into slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you probably know that bread is often sliced like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are even machines to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and with this setup here ill draw the slice with a little bit of a more colorful decoration", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our red slice of bread", "entities": []}
{"text": "its coming around like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it comes back down behind", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our bread slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what id like to figure out is its volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the only other dimension that im going to give because this is a very qualitative analysis for now is what ill call the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the area on the face of the slice", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the limit thats going to be something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe the areas of the slices vary", "entities": []}
{"text": "there might be a little hole in the middle of the bread somewhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it might change as <expression> changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the whole volume you get by adding up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you should think of it in a sort of intuitive way as being analogous to the riemann sum where you would take each slice individually", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that would look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so thats just a superficial and intuitive way of looking at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its already on your problem set you had an example of a slice of some region", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were only going to talk systematically about something called solids of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea here is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose you have some shape some graph which maybe looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to revolve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case im going to revolve it around the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i can draw it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "its maybe a football", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you had made this copy underneath it still would have been the same region", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we only pay attention to whats above the axis here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the basic idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to apply the method of slices to figure out the volume of such regions and give you a general formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then apply it in a specific case", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre very hard to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its hard to visualize with them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were only going to deal with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "since its much harder to draw", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it starts out being more or less like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then were going to sweep it around", "entities": []}
{"text": "swing around", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that traces out something over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which im going to draw this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "it traces out a disk", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its hard for me to draw and im not going to try too hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i drew it more like a wheel looking like a wheel", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway its this little flat disk here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the method that im describing for figuring out the volume is called the method of disks", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be our <expression> method", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to apply the reasoning that i have up on the previous blackboard here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i need to get the volume of this chunk", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way im going to get the volume of this chunk is by figuring out its thickness and its area its crosssectional area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats not too difficult to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this height so this height is what we usually call <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is usually a <expression> its varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this particular distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the area of the face is easy to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its a circle or a disk if you like with this radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its area is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats if you like <expression> of the dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the thickness is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the incremental volume is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the method of disks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the integrand", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are more peculiar things about this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that im integrating with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i havent yet told you what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that will depend on what <equation> i use", "entities": []}
{"text": "if were actually going to calculate something were going to have to figure that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres another very important point which is that in order to get a definite integral something i havent mentioned were going to have to figure out where were starting and were ending the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets deal with an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well switch over from a football to a soccer ball", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take a circle and well say it has radius <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im putting it in this particular spot for a reason", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can do this in lots of different ways but im picking this <expression> to make a certain exercise on your homework easier for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "because im doing half of it for you right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "appreciate it yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "im sure especially today its appreciated", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again the formula has to do with keeping track of these slices here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were sweeping things around", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what our goal is to figure out what the volume of the ball of radius <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright again as i say the thing sweeps around", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the setup is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres our formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we need to figure out whats going on with that formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to do that what were going to do is just write down the equation for the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now theres <expression> nice thing which is that we really didnt need it to find the formula for <expression> we only needed to find the formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "take a square root thats nice", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression>s cancel", "entities": [{"id": 10423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "these <expression> terms cancel", "entities": [{"id": 10425, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "and so the formula here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright now that is whats known as the integrand", "entities": []}
{"text": "well except for this factor of <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the answer for the volume is going to be the integral of <expression> times this integrand <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just the same thing as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now theres also the issue of the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is a completely separate problem which we also have to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "the range of <expression> is from this leftmost point to the rightmost point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> varies starts at <expression> and it goes all the way up to what whats the top value here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now i have a completely specified integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "again and this was the theme last time the whole goal is to get ourselves to a complete formula for something with an integrand and limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well be able to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have clear sailing to the end of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just finish it off", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the thing whose derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that  <expression> times lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so all told that is lets see <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is maybe a familiar formula <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it worked we got it right", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just point out a couple of other things about this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> is that from this point of view weve actually accomplished more then just finding the volume of the ball", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve also found the volume of a bunch of intermediate regions which i can draw schematically this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve got something which is actually a lot more information", "entities": []}
{"text": "for instance if you plug in <equation> not surprisingly and this is a good idea to do because it checks that weve actually got a correct formula here", "entities": [{"id": 10449, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so if you like you can call this a doublecheck", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you check <expression> this should be the volume of a halfball", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats halfway", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i go over here and i only go up to <expression> thats exactly half of the ball", "entities": []}
{"text": "that had better be half so lets just see", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in this case is <expression> and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that turns out to be <expression> times a total of <expression> which is indeed half", "entities": []}
{"text": "now on your problem set what youre going to want to look at is this full formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "of this chunk", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what its going to be good for is a reallife problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is a problem that really came up over the summer and this fall at a couple of universities near here where people were trying to figure out a phenomenon which is wellknown", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if you have a bunch of particles in a fluid and maybe the size of these things is <expression> micron", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have a bunch of other little particles which are a lot smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "then what happens is that the particles the big particles like to hug each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "they like to clump together theyre very nice", "entities": []}
{"text": "friendly characters", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the explanation for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the explanation is that actually they are not quite as friendly as they might seem", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats really happening is that the little guys are shoving them around", "entities": []}
{"text": "and pushing them together", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they have sharp elbows the little ones and theyre pushing them", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont like them to be around and theyre pushing them together", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres actually another possibility", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that they also will stick to the sides of the container", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you want to get a quantitative handle on how much of this happens it has to do with how much space these things take up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the issue is some kind of overlap between a band around <expression> sphere and a band around the other sphere", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this overlap region is what you have to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to calculate whats in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can do that using this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not even difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youre on your way to figuring out this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the question is which do they prefer", "entities": []}
{"text": "do they prefer to touch each other or do they prefer to touch the wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "do they all cluster to the wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can actually see this in solutions what they do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a real live problem which really comes up", "entities": []}
{"text": "came up just this year", "entities": []}
{"text": "and frequently comes up", "entities": []}
{"text": "for solids of revolution which is called the method of disks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i need to tell you about the other standard method", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is called the method of shells", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is supposed to be a witches cauldron", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops witch witches well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres this shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to figure out how much liquid is in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to plot this", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill put this down just a bit lower here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to make it a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to make the top height be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres my situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to figure out how much liquid is in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason why i presented the problem in this form of course is really to get you used to these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you spin the parabola around you get this kind of shape this kind of solid shape here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to use the same kind of slicing that i did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its going to look totally different", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely ill draw it in red again", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take a little slice over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to imagine what happens if it gets revolved around the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "this time its not a disk", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually if i revolve this around the other way it would have had a hole in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is also possible to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats practically the same as the method of disks", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll maybe discuss that in recitation", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway were going to revolve it around this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again i need to sweep it around swing it around like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill draw the shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to sweep around in a circle and maybe itll have a little bit of thickness to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the thing that people call a shell", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the socalled shell of the method", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would maybe call it a cylinder and another way of thinking about it is that you can maybe wrap up a piece of paper", "entities": []}
{"text": "like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "there it is theres a cylinder you can see", "entities": []}
{"text": "very thin right", "entities": []}
{"text": "very thin", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason why i used the piece of paper as an example of this is that im going to have to figure out the volume of this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its thickness as usual  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its height is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well actually i have to use the diagram to see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now again this is an incredibly risky thing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in disguise when i call this <expression> i mean <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the interesting curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont mean <equation> which is the other part", "entities": []}
{"text": "in general you might think of it as being  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are of course <expression> <expression>s involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "in disguise", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last bit that i have to do i claim in order to figure this out is the circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason for that is that if i think of this thing as like this tube or piece of paper here in order to figure out how much stuff there is here all i have to do is unfold it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its size the whole quantity of paper here is the same whether its rolled up like this or whether its stretched out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i unwrap it it looks like what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it looks like kind of a slab", "entities": []}
{"text": "right it looks like just a slab like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again the thickness is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the height is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can see that the length here is all the way around", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be the circumference when i unwrap it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to figure out the circumference i need to figure out the radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the radius is on this diagram is right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this length here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this circumference is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this height is still ay", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the thickness is still <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in total were just going to multiply these numbers together to get the total volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have in other words <expression>  the product of the <expression> dimension dimension the <expression> dimension and the <expression> dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "incidentally dimensional analysis is very useful and important in these problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see that there are <expression> lengths being multiplied together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well get a volume in end", "entities": []}
{"text": "something cubic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will be coming back to that because its a quite subtle issue sometimes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the formula and lets simplify it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i rewrite that as <expression> <expression> whoops <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "better not get that wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the last little bit here that i had better be careful about in order to figure out what the total volume is is the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the volume is going to be the integral of this quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have to pay attention to what the limits are", "entities": []}
{"text": "now here you have to be careful", "entities": []}
{"text": "i went to it immediately but thats the whole point", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that everything gets read off from this diagram here", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you take this guy and you sweep it around you take care of everything thats to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we only have to count whats to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont have to count anything over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its taken care of when we sweep around", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats where we start", "entities": []}
{"text": "and where we end is the farthest rightmost spot for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve got to watch out about where that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the <expression> variable its up at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in the <expression> variable we can see that its what", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these limits this is where youre going to focus all your attention on the integrand and getting it just right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youre going to lose your steam and not pay attention to the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre equally important", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve no hope of getting the right answer without getting the limits right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again thats just because <equation> and <equation> implies <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats that upper limit there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were ready to carry out this to evaluate this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get <expression> sorry we get <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill leave the <expression>s in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally lets see what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is a total of <expression> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes question", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is why did i integrate only from the middle to this end instead of all the way from over here <expression> all the way to the plus end", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is that you have to look at whats happening with the rotation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this red guy when i swept it around i counted the stuff to the right and the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words if i just rotate the right half of this im covering the left half", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i counted the stuff from <expression> i would be doing it twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would be doubling what i need", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way of saying it is if i wanted to take the whole region if i rotate it around only <expression> degrees only <expression> that would fill up the whole region if i did both halves", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then instead of a circumference instead of a <expression> i could use a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then i would have double what i had", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are <expression> ways of looking at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same goes actually for the football case", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i have that football i didnt count the bottom part", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "ooh good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is when do you know how do you know when to take the rectangle to be vertical or horizontal", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far weve only done vertical rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to do a horizontal example in a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer to the question of when you do it is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can always set it up both ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> way may be a difficult calculation and <expression> way may be an easier calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "yesterday we did it  or sorry the last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah i guess it was yesterday", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did it with and the horizontal and the vertical were quite different in character", "entities": []}
{"text": "so very often <expression> will be easier than the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the difference in difficulty can be extreme", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you dont know that in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is did we just find the volume when you rotate this green region around", "entities": []}
{"text": "or did we find the volume when we rotate this whole region", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words just the right half or the right and the left half", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is both", "entities": []}
{"text": "the region that you get is the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "you always get this cauldron whether you take this right half when you rotate it around or you take both and you rotate it around", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer to both of those questions is the same and its this", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that if you rotated them both around and you only wanted to cover things once you would rotate halfway around", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats true", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can rotate around as many times as you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre still covering the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "over and over and over and over again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a very subtle point that i need to discuss with you in order to go on to the next application", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres my and i do want to get to the point of horizontal crosssections as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue here", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres something a little fishy in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it can be summarized in the character of the answer which is just a little bit not clear", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know that a is in units and we shouldve gotten cubic units", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres something a little bit tricky about this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i want to illustrate the paradox right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose that <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 10549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and suppose the units are centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the formula for the volume is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the units we must take are centimeters cubed", "entities": []}
{"text": "despite the fact that you kind of want to square the centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not what this problem says", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this is the situation that weve got", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you work out what this is to figure out what the volume of this cauldron is what you find is that its <expression> well <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and those are otherwise known as liters", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is approximately <expression> liters which is about <expression> liters", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats how much was in the cauldron under this choice of units", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to make another choice of units now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to make a comparison", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the formula tells us to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a paradox", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a serious paradox", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you really want to apply problems you actually have to understand what your answers mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do you think is going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is how could either of these make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "how am i dealing with the units in either case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to explain to you the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is really quite puzzling", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it has a resolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer to this question is that both answers are correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is correct reasoning in both cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the matter is that you have to interpret the equation <equation> in <expression> different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me explain what they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "for instance you can take <equation> in centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this distance here which is the <expression> value this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what the relationship means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the top of the cauldron if you like this distance here is <expression> centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually very badly drawn to scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually very very deep this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a rather skinny deep <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is very much not to scale this picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other picture the other picture is interpreting <equation> in meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats more like what i had in mind actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "i had in mind this big vat here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this distance here is <expression> meter and then the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this distance here is also <expression> meter", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the top is <expression> meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "now its not that crazy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact its easy to check that its pretty reasonable in terms of scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "that this thing has <expression> liters in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this guy has <expression> liters in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you actually have to know what your symbols mean when youre dealing with these kinds of applied problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if youre ever really going to do some real consequences you have to know what the units mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the problem with the equation <equation> is that its the <expression> that violated scaling rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the question is whether the formula <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the correct answer to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it is not consistent in units", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre all inconsistent", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words this formula violates scaling", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you study each step correctly you will discover that these are the consistent and correct statements what im writing on the blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this makes sense in a unitless sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a mistake to think of this as being 1 meter and cubing the meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will be an error that will cause you problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i encourage you to study this on your own", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to introduce the next problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "well have to solve it next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the reason why i spent all the time on units is that otherwise it would be impossible for you to believe me when i do this next calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "because were trying to get a real answer out of a real question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to make conversions between centimeters and meters back and forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have to get it consistent in order to have the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there was a reason for illustrating this pitfall", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is definitely seasonally appropriate since were approaching halloween", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well work it out fully next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to introduce another feature into the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "well set it all up tomorrow but right now i need you to understand what the new main idea that were going to get", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is the new physical feature that im going to add to this problem is that if when youre boiling when the witches are boiling this water the temperature of the water is not the same at each level in the kettle", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the bottom of the kettle where youre heating it up its at its highest temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is its going to be totally boiling", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> degrees celsius", "entities": []}
{"text": "right its very cold outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact its <expression> degrees outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the temperature at which all witches operate i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so theyre boiling their stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the question that were going to ask is how much heat how much heat do they need to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to heat it up to this temperature configuration here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its rising from <expression> down here to <expression> up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the temperature is varying in height", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for simplicity im going to make the formula for the temperature be <expression> at the top and <expression> at the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the situation that we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the point about this problem is were going to figure out the total temperature the total amount of heat that you need to add in order to heat this thing up", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be temperature times volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "but some places will count more than others", "entities": []}
{"text": "these will be hotter but theres less water down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is wider up here so theres more water up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are various things that are varying in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the only way to set up so that it works is to chop things up horizontally instead of vertically", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its on the horizontal levels that the temperature is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well have an easy calculation for how much it takes to heat up a layer a horizontal layer", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we rotate this guy around the y axis that is which kind of shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a disk", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually this <expression>s going to be an easier problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be a disk problem not a shell problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were going to have to work things out with respect to the dy variation", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the integral will be with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we will do that next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "well figure out how much heat it takes to boil the kettle", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok i filled your brain with a bunch of partial derivatives and <expression>s with respect to <expression>s and <expression>s", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think now its time to actually do it with a real differential equation and make things a little bit more concrete", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i have the differential <expression> the differential equation <expression> plus im already running out of space <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10616, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 10617, "label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "well your brain is already hopefully in exact differential equations mode", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you were to see this pattern in general where you see a function of <expression> and <expression> here this is just some <expression> and <expression> and then you have another <expression> and <expression> <expression> or <expression> <expression> your brain should immediately say if this is inseparable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im not going to try to make it separable just because thatll take a lot of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if its not separable your brain said oh maybe this is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you say let me test whether this is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is an exact equation this is our <expression> which is a <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is our <expression> which is a <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the test is to see if the partial of this with respect to <expression>  the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>  lets see <expression> is so this <expression> is just a constant so its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> plus now whats the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is just a constant whats the derivative of <expression> to the <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its just <expression> to the <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the constant on the outside <expression> times the derivative with respect to <expression> so its <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> or the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> so whats the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy thats <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> is just a constant because <expression> is constant when were taking the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> the derivative of a constant with respect to anything is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> which lo and behold is the same thing as the derivative the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now given that this is an exact equation oh my wife snuck up behind me i was wondering", "entities": []}
{"text": "i thought there was some critter in my house or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so we know that this is an exact equation so what does that tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that tells us that theres some <expression> where the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>  <expression> and the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we know that <expression> then we can rewrite our differential equation as the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10688, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "so lets solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could write that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could have done it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could have said the partial of <expression> the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is this thing over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just do it with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just write that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were integrating with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and normally when you integrate with respect to <expression> youd say ok <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you take the antiderivative you were like oh well there might have been some <expression> here that we lost when we took the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets figure out this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it in blue so <expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the antiderivative of<expression> is just <expression> plus either the <expression> is constant so <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10734, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "the antiderivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "ok so were almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve almost figured out our <expression> but we still need to figure out this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know that if we take the partial of this with respect to <expression> since this is an exact equation we should get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we should get our <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial ill switch notation just to expose you to it the partial <expression> with respect to <expression> is going to be  so here <expression> <expression> is just a constant", "entities": [{"id": 10755, "label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 128}]}
{"text": "<expression> is just <expression> so the derivative of this with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}

{"text": "its going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10768, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "well what did we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "we took <expression> we integrated with respect to <expression> and we said well we might have lost some function of <expression> so we added that to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we took the partial of that side that weve almost constructed and we took the partial of that with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our <expression> is up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh no sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "our <expression> is up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> let me write that <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10781, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was just our <expression> from our original differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see we can delete <expression> from both sides", "entities": [{"id": 10787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 10788, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 54}]}

{"text": "and then what are we left with", "entities": []}
{"text": "were left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were left with <expression>  well it  <expression> plus some constant <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 10796, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "so what is our <expression> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wrote our <expression> up here and we had this <expression> here so we can rewrite it now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is a <expression> and <expression> were actually pretty much almost done solving it <expression> is a <expression> and <equation> oh sorry this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be a <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10810, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so weve solved for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what does that tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you were to integrate both sides of this you would get that <equation> is a solution of that differential equation", "entities": [{"id": 10817, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 10818, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "so if we were to set this is  <expression> thats the differential equation", "entities": [{"id": 10820, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so we could say <expression> now we could say plus this <expression> plus this <expression> you call it <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 10825, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 10826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}, {"id": 10828, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 50}, {"id": 10829, "label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "well you could subtract the <expression>s from both sides and just be left with a <expression> at the end", "entities": [{"id": 10832, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 10834, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "but anyway we have solved this exact equation <expression> <expression> by recognizing it was exact by taking the partial of this with respect to <expression> and seeing if that was  the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "once we saw that they were  were like ok this is going to be exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets figure out <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "since this is exact <expression> is going to be the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then to figure out <expression> we integrated <expression> with respect to <expression> and we got this", "entities": []}
{"text": "to figure out the function of <expression> we then took our <expression> that we figured out took the partial of that with respect to <expression> got this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we had our final <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our final <expression> was this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the differential equation because of the chain rule of partial derivatives we could rewrite the differential equation as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solution is this and so this is the solution to our differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the rest of the term we are going to be studying not just <expression> differential equation at a time but rather what are called systems of differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are like systems of linear equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "they have to be solved simultaneously in other words not just <expression> at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how does a system look when you write it down", "entities": []}
{"text": "well since we are going to be talking about systems of ordinary differential equations there still will be only <expression> independent variable but there will be several dependent variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to call lets say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10863, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "the dependent variables are going to be i will call them <expression> and <expression> and then the <expression> order system something involving just <expression> derivatives will look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the lefthand side will be <expression> in other words", "entities": [{"id": 10869, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 10870, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "on the righthand side will be the dependent variables and then also the independent variables", "entities": [{"id": 10871, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "i will indicate that i will separate it all from the others by putting a semicolon there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same way <expression> the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> will be some other function of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what they depend upon is the independent variable <expression> time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there is still more terminology", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course practically all the equations after the term started virtually all the equations we have been considering are linear equations so it must be true that linear systems are the best kind", "entities": []}
{"text": "and boy they certainly are", "entities": []}
{"text": "when are we going to call a system linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think in the beginning you should learn a little terminology before we launch in and actually try to start to solve these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the <expression> and <expression> the dependent variables must occur linearly", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words it must look like this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but even the <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression> are allowed to be functions of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "they could be <expression> or <expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to distinguish those cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "the case where <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression> are constants that i will call well there are different things you can call it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will simply call it a constant coefficient system", "entities": []}
{"text": "a system with coefficients would probably be better english", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression> this system will still be called linear if these are functions of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "can also be functions of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be a perfectly good linear system to have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would never see something like that but it is okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "what else do you need to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what would a homogenous system be", "entities": []}
{"text": "a homogenous system is <expression> without these extra guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "that doesnt mean there is no <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a linear homogenous", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the kind we are going to start studying <expression> in the same way when we studied higher order equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so linear homogenous means that <equation> and <equation> for all time", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are identically <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are not there", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont see them", "entities": []}
{"text": "have i left anything out", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes the initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "since that is quite general lets talk about what would initial conditions look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in a general way the reason you have to have initial conditions is to get values for the arbitrary constants that appear in the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is how many arbitrary constants are going to appear in the solutions of these equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i will just give you the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the number of arbitrary constants that appear is the total order of the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example if this were a <expression> derivative and this were a <expression> derivative i would expect <expression> arbitrary constants in the system because the total the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you must have as many initial conditions as you have arbitrary constants in the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "i had to specify the initial starting point and the initial velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same thing happens here but the answer is it is more natural the conditions here are more natural", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have to specify the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "why not", "entities": []}
{"text": "well because an initial condition of course would want me to say what the starting value of <expression> is some number and it will also want to know what the starting value of <expression> is at that same point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since this is going to have <expression> arbitrary constants in it it is these initial conditions that will satisfy the arbitrary constants will have to be picked so as to satisfy those initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont have to be the least bit cleaver about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact there are other kinds of conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cannot think of any more general terminology so it sounds like we are going to actually have to get to work", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets get to work", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to set up a system and solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since <expression> of the things in this course is supposed to be simple modeling it should be a system that models something", "entities": []}
{"text": "mixing radioactive decay temperature the motion of temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "heat heat conduction in other words", "entities": []}
{"text": "diffusion", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have given you a diffusion problem for your <expression> homework on this subject", "entities": []}
{"text": "what else did we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all i can think of for the moment but i am sure they will occur to me", "entities": []}
{"text": "when out of those physical ideas are we going to get a system", "entities": []}
{"text": "say you want to have a big tank and a little tank here and you want to put some stuff into the little tank so that it will get mixed in the big tank without having to climb a big ladder and stop and drop the stuff in", "entities": []}
{"text": "or to give something closer to home closer to this backboard anyway suppose you have dah dah dah dont groan at least not audibly something that looks like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and next to it put an <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but suppose it is a <expression> loop circuit", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i need a pair of equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "each of these loops gives a <expression> order differential equation but they have to be solved simultaneously to find the current or the charges on the condensers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i want a system of <expression> equations throw in another loop", "entities": []}
{"text": "now suppose i put in a coil instead", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is this going to lead to", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to give me a system of <expression> equations of which this will be <expression> order <expression> order", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this will be <expression> order because it has a coil", "entities": []}
{"text": "you are up to that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve had coils inductance", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "to find out how complicated it is you have to add up the orders", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is <expression> and <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to return to a problem we considered earlier in the problem of heat conduction", "entities": []}
{"text": "i had forgotten whether it was on the problem set or i did it in class but i am choosing it because it leads to something we will be able to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and because it illustrates how to add a little sophistication to something that was unsophisticated before", "entities": []}
{"text": "a pot of water", "entities": []}
{"text": "external temperature <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am talking about the temperature of something", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i am talking about the temperature of will be an egg that is cooking inside but with a difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "this egg is not homogenous inside", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead it has a white and it has a yolk in the middle", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words it is a real egg and not a phony egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is a small pot or it is an ostrich egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter that is the yoke", "entities": []}
{"text": "the yolk is contained in a little membrane inside", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are little yucky things that hold it in position", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the temperature of the yolk", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh thats the water bath", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is liquid at the beginning at any rate but it certainly has different constants of conductivity than the egg white would", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the condition of heat through the shell of the egg would be different from the conduction of heat through the membrane that keeps the yoke together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it is quite reasonable to consider that the white and the yolk will be at different temperatures and will have different conductivity properties", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to use newtons laws but with this further refinement", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words introducing <expression> temperatures", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets use newtons law", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the yolk is getting all its heat from the white", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is going to be <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 10988, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "here i have a system of equations because i want to make <expression> dependent variables by refining the original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you always have to write a system in standard form to solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case the temperature of the yolk and then the temperature of the white", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that for example what might be some possibilities well suppose the problem was i wanted to coddle the egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think there is a generation gap here", "entities": []}
{"text": "how many of you know what a coddled egg is", "entities": []}
{"text": "how many of you dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im just saying my daughter didnt know", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mentioned it to her", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said i think im going to do a coddled egg tomorrow in class", "entities": []}
{"text": "and she said what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i said a cuddled egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "she said why would someone cuddle an egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said coddle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and she said oh you mean like a person like what you do to somebody you like or dont like or i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "i thought a while and said yeah more like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is why people do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "you heat up the water to boiling the egg should be at room temperature and then you carefully lower the egg into the water", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you turn off the heat so the water bath cools exponentially while the egg inside is rising in temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have a perfect egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for coddling spelled so what will the external temperature be", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason you have it boiling is for calibration so that you can know what temperature it is without having to use a thermometer unless youre on pikes peak or some place", "entities": []}
{"text": "it starts out at <expression> degrees", "entities": []}
{"text": "and after that since the light is off it cools exponential because that is another law", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words you will then be able to solve these equations and know how the temperature rises", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to solve a different problem because i dont want to have to deal with this inhomogeneous term", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets use as a different problem a person cooks an egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "not just to cool it but also because i think it prevents that dark thing from forming that looks sort of unattractive", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets ice bath", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only reason for dropping the egg into an ice bath is so that you could have a homogenous equation to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "now all my work in preparing this example and it took considerably longer time than actually solving the problem was in picking values for a and b which would make everything come out nice", "entities": []}
{"text": "its harder than it looks", "entities": []}
{"text": "the values that we are going to use which make no physical sense whatsoever but <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are called nice numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "can somebody read it off for me", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>  what is it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats good", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other <expression> is <expression> so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a system", "entities": []}
{"text": "now on wednesday i will teach you a fancy way of solving this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but to be honest the fancy way will take roughly about as long as the way i am going to do it now", "entities": []}
{"text": "the main reason for doing it is that it introduces new vocabulary which everyone wants you to have", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also more important reasons it gives more insight into the solution than this method", "entities": []}
{"text": "this method just produces the answer but you want insight also", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is just as important", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for now lets use a method which always works and which in 40 years after you have forgotten all other fancy methods will still be available to you because it is method you can figure out yourself", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont have to remember anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "the method is to eliminate <expression> of the dependent variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is just the way you solve systems of linear equations in general if you arent doing something fancy with determinants and matrices", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you just eliminate variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are going to eliminate <expression> of these variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets eliminate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11026, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "you could also eliminate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11028, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "how do i eliminate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "beg your pardon", "entities": []}
{"text": "is something wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "if somebody thinks something is wrong raise his hand", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do i want to get rid of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i can add them", "entities": []}
{"text": "what good is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11037, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "wherever you see a <expression> put that in and what you will be left with is something just in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to be honest i dont know any other good way of doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is a fancy method that i think is talked about in your book which leads to extraneous solutions and so on but you dont want to know about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will work for a simple linear equation with constant coefficients always", "entities": []}
{"text": "substitute in", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "now here i do not advise doing this mentally", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is just too easy to make a mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i will do it carefully writing everything out just as you would", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i took that and substituted into this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i dont like those <expression>s", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets get rid of them by multiplying", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will become <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11044, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and now write this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is this when you look at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an equation just in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has constant coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is its order", "entities": []}
{"text": "its order is <expression> because <expression> primed", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words i can eliminate <expression> okay but the equation i am going to get is no longer a <expression>order", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats a basic law", "entities": []}
{"text": "even if you have a system of more equations <expression> or <expression> or whatever the law is that after you do the elimination successfully and end up with a single equation normally the order of that equation will be the sum of the orders of the things you started with", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is like all mathematical problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "you say oh i didnt save anything after all", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the law of conservation of mathematical difficulty", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the beginning it looks great youve got these tables take the equation horrible to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "take some transform trivial to solve for capital <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i have to find the inverse laplace transform", "entities": []}
{"text": "and suddenly all the work is there partial fractions funny formulas and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is very hard in mathematics to get away with something", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens now and then and everybody cheers", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write this out now in the form in which it looks like an equation we can actually solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "just be careful", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it is all right to use the method by which you collect terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is only <expression> term involving <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the <expression> that comes from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about the terms in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here there is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i put it on the other side it makes <expression> this <expression> makes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how many <expression>s are there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well none on the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> put on this lefthand side the way we want to do makes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are no inhomogeneous terms so that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i had gotten a negative number for <expression> of these coefficients i would instantly know if i had made a mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "why", "entities": []}
{"text": "why must those numbers come out to be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is because the system must be the system must be fill in with <expression> word stable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why must this system be stable", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the longterm solutions must be <expression> must all go to <expression> whatever they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well because you are putting the egg into an ice bath", "entities": []}
{"text": "or because we know it was living but after being hardboiled it is dead and therefore dead systems are stable", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore the differential equation must have the same property and that means that its coefficients must be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "all its coefficients must be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this werent there i would get oscillating solutions which wouldnt go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is physical impossible for this egg", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the rest is just solving", "entities": []}
{"text": "the characteristic equation if you can remember way way back in prehistoric times when we were solving these equations is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what you want to do is factor it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is where all the work was getting those numbers so that this would factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> and so the solutions are the roots are <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am just making marks on the board but you have done this often enough you know what i am talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the characteristic roots are those <expression> numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore the solution is i could write down immediately with its arbitrary constant as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i have got to get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the <expression> worry is <expression> is going to give me <expression> more arbitrary constants", "entities": [{"id": 11095, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "it better not", "entities": []}
{"text": "the system is only allowed to have <expression> arbitrary constants in its solution because that is the initial conditions we are giving it", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way i forgot to give initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets give initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "realistic numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the thing not to do is to say hey i found <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay i will find <expression> by the same procedure", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will go through the whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will eliminate <expression> instead", "entities": [{"id": 11104, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and that is no good", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the correct solution only has <expression> constants in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that procedure is wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the <expression> we have to have", "entities": []}
{"text": "where is the chalk", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i can have a little thing so i can just carry this around with me", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the relation between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you dont like it either <expression> of these equations will express <expression> in terms of <expression> for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "whichever <expression> you use however you do it thats the way you must calculate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the coefficient is <expression> take <expression> of that that is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "<expression> gives me <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11134, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "take half of that <expression> and add this <expression> to it <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11139, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 11140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice it uses the same arbitrary constants that <expression> uses", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we end up with just <expression> because we calculated <expression> from that formula or from the equation which is equivalent to it not from scratch", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent put in the initial conditions yet but that is easy to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "everybody when working with exponentials of course you always want the initial conditions to be when <equation> because that makes all the exponentials <expression> and you dont have to worry about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> should be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11152, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "now we are supposed to solve these", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is called solving simultaneous linear equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could use kramers rule inverse matrices but why dont we just eliminate", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i multiply by <expression> so <expression> you get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "and if <equation> then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes thats right", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives the answer to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells you in other words how the temperature of the yolk varies with time and how the temperature of the white varies with time", "entities": []}
{"text": "as i said we are going to learn a slick way of doing this problem or at least a very different way of doing the same problem next time but lets put that on ice for the moment", "entities": []}
{"text": "and instead i would like to spend the rest of the period doing for <expression> order systems the same thing that i did for you the very <expression> day of the term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we spent a little while working on such problems because nowadays with computers it is really important that you get a feeling for what these things mean as opposed to just algorithms for solving them", "entities": []}
{"text": "as i say most differential equations especially systems are likely to be solved by a computer anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to be the guiding genius that interprets the answers and can see when mistakes are being made stuff like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the problem is therefore what is the meaning of this system", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i dont know what to do if it does up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a word for these", "entities": []}
{"text": "just curious", "entities": []}
{"text": "autonomous right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an autonomous system", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is not a linear system because these are messy functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "this could be <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be a mess", "entities": []}
{"text": "definitely not linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> means the independent variable appears on the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course it is there", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is buried in the <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it is not on the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets see what does a solution look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "i never even talked about what a solution was did i", "entities": []}
{"text": "well pretend that immediately after i talked about that i talked about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the solution maybe you took it for granted is a pair of functions <expression> <expression> if when you plug it in it satisfies the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what else is new", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solution is <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i draw a picture of that what would it look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do you draw a picture of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does it represent", "entities": []}
{"text": "a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what will be the title of the chapter of the calculus book in which that is discussed", "entities": []}
{"text": "parametric equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a parameterized curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know what the solution looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "our solution is a parameterized curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what does a parameterized curve look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it travels and in a certain direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do i have several of those curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "well because i have several solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact given any initial starting point there is a solution that goes through it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will put in possible starting points", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can do this on the computer screen with a little program you will have <expression> of the visuals youll have", "entities": []}
{"text": "its being made right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put down starter point put down a click and then it just draws the curve passing through that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "didnt we do this early in the term", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there is a difference now which i will explain", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are various possible starting points at time <expression> for this solution and then you see what happens to it afterwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact through every point in the plane will pass a solution curve parameterized curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is then the representation of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is the meaning of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am not going to worry for the moment about the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does this mean by itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is the curve the parameterized motion then this represents its velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is the velocity of the solution at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i think of the solution as being a parameterized motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i have drawn here is the trace the path of the motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "this hasnt indicated how fast it was going", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is a velocity and that velocity changes from point to point", "entities": []}
{"text": "it changes direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know its direction at each point", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i cannot tell is the speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "from this picture i cannot tell what the speed was", "entities": []}
{"text": "too bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is then the meaning of the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "what the system does it prescribes at each point the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at each point there is a certain vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "the vector is always tangent to the solution curve through there but i cannot predict from just this picture what its length will be because at some points it might be going slow", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solution might be going slowly", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the plane is filled up with these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "stop me", "entities": []}
{"text": "not enough here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so on and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "a field of velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "the plane covered with velocity vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a solution is a parameterized curve with the right velocity everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there obviously must be a connection between that and the direction fields we studied at the beginning of the term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there is", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is a very important connection", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we need it i will have to spend some time talking about it then", "entities": []}
{"text": "the topic for today is how to change variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were talking about substitutions and differential equations or changing variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the sad fact is that in some sense those are the only <expression> general methods there are that those are the only <expression> kinds of equations that can always be solved", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what about all the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ultimately as you will see the way the equations are solved is by changing them into a linear equation or an equation where the variables are separable", "entities": []}
{"text": "however thats for a few minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its the most common kind there is and youve already had it in physics class", "entities": []}
{"text": "and scaling simply means to change the coordinates in effect or axes to change the coordinates on the axes to scale the axes to either stretch them or contract them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does the change of variable actually look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the new variable <expression> is related to the old <expression> by an equation of that form", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> are constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are the equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "why does <expression> do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well for a lot of reasons", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe we can list them", "entities": []}
{"text": "you for example could be changing units", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a common reason in physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "changing the units that he used you would have to make a change of coordinates of this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "perhaps the even more important reason is to sometimes its used to make the variables dimensionless", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words so that the variables become pure numbers with no units attached to them", "entities": []}
{"text": "since you are well aware of the tortures involved in dealing with units in physics the point of making variables im sorry dimensionless i dont have to sell that", "entities": []}
{"text": "dimensionless ie no units without any units attached", "entities": []}
{"text": "reduce their number is self explanatory", "entities": []}
{"text": "simplify means make them less either dimensionless also or if you cant do that at least less dependent upon the critical units than the old ones were", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give you a very simple example which will illustrate most of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a version of the cooling law which applies at very high temperatures and it runs", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is the external constant which ill assume now is a constant external temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is valid if big temperature differences newtons law breaks down and <expression> needs a different <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you are free to solve that equation just as it stands if you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are difficulties connected with it because youre dealing with the <expression> powers of course", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before you do that <expression> should scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "how should i scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is very likely to use is <equation> divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11254, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "and therefore by taking the ratio of the <expression> there are no units attached to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is dimensionless", "entities": []}
{"text": "now how actually do i change the variable in the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well watch this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an utterly trivial idea and utterly important", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont slog around doing it this way trying to stuff it in and divide <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11259, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "instead do the inverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words write it instead as <equation> the reason being that its <expression> thats facing you in that equation and therefore <expression> you want to substitute for", "entities": [{"id": 11263, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the new equation will be what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> since this is a constant the lefthand side becomes <equation> so im going to factor out that <expression> and make it <expression> okay", "entities": [{"id": 11269, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 60}, {"id": 11270, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "now i could divide through by <expression> and get rid of <expression> of those and so the new equation now is <expression> <expression>  now i have <expression> <expression> cubed out front here", "entities": [{"id": 11277, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "im going to just give that a new name <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "essentially its the same equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its no harder to solve and no easier to solve than the original <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its been simplified", "entities": []}
{"text": "for <expression> i think it looks better", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to compare the <expression> ill put this <expression> up in green and this <expression> in green too just to convince you its the same but indicate that its the same equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice so <expression> has been rendered is now dimensionless", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i dont have to even ask when i solve this equation oh please tell me what the units of temperature are", "entities": []}
{"text": "how you are measuring temperature makes no difference to this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> still has units", "entities": []}
{"text": "what units does it have", "entities": []}
{"text": "its been simplified because it now has the units of since this is dimensionless and this is dimensionless it has the units of inverse time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and moreover theres <expression> less constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> less constant in the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just looks better", "entities": []}
{"text": "this business i think you know that <expression> the process of forming <expression> out of <expression> is called lumping constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think they use standard terminology in physics and engineering courses", "entities": []}
{"text": "try to get all the constants together like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you lump them there", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are lumped for you and then you just give the lump a new name", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an example of scaling", "entities": []}
{"text": "watch out for when you can use that", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets now go to serious stuff where we are actually going to make changes of variables which we hope will render unsolvable equations suddenly solvable", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to do that by making substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its i think quite important to watch up there are <expression> kinds of substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are direct substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats where you introduce a new variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know how to write this on the board", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just write it schematically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> which says that the new variable  some combination of the old variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other kind of substitution is inverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the reverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "here you say that the old variables are some combination of the new", "entities": []}
{"text": "now often youll have to stick in a few old variables too", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the basic its what appears on the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "now right here we have an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the way i define the new variable which of course you have to do if youre introducing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but when i actually did the substitution i did the inverse substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i used <equation> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason for doing that was because it was the capital <expression>s that faced me in the equation and i had to have something to replace them with", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you see this already in calculus this distinction", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that might have been a year and a half ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you calculate and then you would observe that this the <expression> more or less makes up <expression> apart from a constant factor there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would be an example of direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put it in and convert the integral into an integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what would be an example of inverse substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i take away the <expression> and ask you instead to do this integral then you know that the right thing to do is not to start with <expression> but to start with the <expression> and write <equation> or <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11310, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 11311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 191, "end_offset": 196}]}
{"text": "so this is a direct substitution in that integral but this integral calls for an inverse substitution in order to be able to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice they would look practically the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course as you know from your experience they are not", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre very different", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so im going to watch for that distinction as i do these examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> i want to do is an example as a direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well notice for example if <expression> were <expression> what kind of equation would this be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> we already know how to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if <expression> were  <expression> you could separate variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that too is not exciting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but nonetheless it will be included in what im going to say now", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is <expression> or <expression> or <expression> could be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so anything even <expression> is all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just silly", "entities": []}
{"text": "any number it could be negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be fine also", "entities": []}
{"text": "this kind of equation to give it its name is called the bernoulli equation named after which bernoulli i havent the faintest idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "there were i think <expression> or <expression> of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they fought with each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "but they were all smart", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the key trick if you like method to solving any bernoulli equation let me call another thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "most important is whats missing", "entities": []}
{"text": "it must not have a pure <expression> term in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that goes for a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words it must look exactly like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "everything multiplied by <expression> or a power of <expression> <expression> terms", "entities": [{"id": 11340, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 11341, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "right its very easy to contaminate it into an equation thats unsolvable", "entities": []}
{"text": "its got to look just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now youve got <expression> on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve got several", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is practical in some sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do we got", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea is to divide by <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11348, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "ignore all formulas that youre given", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so <equation> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that certainly doesnt look any better than what i started with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in your terms it probably looks somewhat worse because its got all those ys at the denominator and who wants to see them there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but look at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this very slightly transformed bernoulli equation is a linear equation struggling to be free", "entities": []}
{"text": "where is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is it trying to be a linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "make a new variable call this hunk of it in new variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you like you can think of that as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression> prime", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the direct substitution i am going to use but of course the problem is what am i going to use on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the little miracle happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "as i said you could separate variables if <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the equation then turned into", "entities": []}
{"text": "its linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now solve it as a linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "solve it as a linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you notice its not in standard form not in standard linear form", "entities": []}
{"text": "to do that youre going to have to put the p on the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats okay that term on the other side solve it and at the end dont forget that you put in the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it wasnt in the original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have to convert the problem the answer back in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do a really simple example just to illustrate the method and to illustrate the fact that i dont want you to memorize formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "learn methods not final formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose the equation is lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11368, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "thats a bernoulli equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could of course have concealed it by writing <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it wouldnt look instantly like a bernoulli equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would have to stare at it a while and say hey thats a bernoulli equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay but so im handing it to you a silver platter as it were", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "divide through by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11371, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the substitution then im going to make is for this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11377, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "okay so whats this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only thing is its got a negative sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation> stays <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets put that in standard form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it will turn into <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11387, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so thats the linear equation in standard linear form that we are asked to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the solution isnt very hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "that makes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> to the <expression> so its <expression> to the <expression> which is of course just <expression> itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> for the maybe i shouldnt skip a step", "entities": []}
{"text": "you are still learning this stuff so lets not skip a step", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it becomes <equation> okay", "entities": [{"id": 11400, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "after i multiplied through by the integrating factor this now says this is <expression> and i quickly check that that in fact is what its   <expression> and therefore <equation> plus a constant", "entities": [{"id": 11404, "label": "command", "start_offset": 178, "end_offset": 182}]}
{"text": "and therefore <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can leave it at that form or you can combine terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt matter much", "entities": []}
{"text": "am i done", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> wasnt in the original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was <expression> that was in the original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore the relation is <expression> is the reciprocal of the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore i have to turn this expression upside down", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if youre going to have to turn it upside down you probably should make it look a little better", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets rewrite it as <expression> combining fractions i think they call it in high school or elementary school plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "hows that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> you dont call it constant <expression> because this is just as arbitrary to call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill call that so my answer will be <equation> plus an arbitrary constant", "entities": [{"id": 11418, "label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "but to indicate its different from that <expression> ill call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> the old <expression> but that doesnt really matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has an arbitrary constant in it but you note its not an additive arbitrary constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "the arbitrary constant is tucked into the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you had to satisfy an initial condition you would take this form and starting from this form figure out what <expression> was in order to satisfy that initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "thus bernoulli equation is solved", "entities": []}
{"text": "our <expression> bernoulli equation isnt that exciting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here was the equation and there is its solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope you will find them interesting questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "you already have the experimental evidence from the <expression> problem set and the problem is to explain the experimental evidence by actually solving the equation in the scene", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think youll find it interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe thats just a pious hope", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its unfortunately just the right word to describe them", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is different but nonetheless the <expression> uses of the word have the same common source", "entities": []}
{"text": "the homogeneous differential equation homogeneous newspeak is <expression>  its a question of what the right hand side looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the supposed way to say it is you should be able to write the righthand side as a function of a combined variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words after fooling around with the right hand side a little bit you should be able to write it so that every time a variable appears its always in the combination <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give some examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example suppose <expression> were lets say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11440, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 11441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "well that doesnt look in that form", "entities": []}
{"text": "well yes it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "imagine dividing the top and bottom by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11443, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 11445, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}, {"id": 11446, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "what would you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the way it started out looking but you just said ahha that was a homogeneous equation because i could see it could be written that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about another homogeneous equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that a homogeneous equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course it is otherwise why would i be talking about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it becomes the <expression> which is <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11456, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "its homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you might say hey this looks like you had to be rather clever to figure out if an equation is homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "is there some other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah there is another way and its the other way which explains why its called homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can think of it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an equation which is in modern speak invariant invariant under the operation zoom", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is zoom", "entities": []}
{"text": "zoom is you increase the scale equally on both axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the zoom operation is the <expression> which sends <expression> into a times <expression> and <expression> into a times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11462, "label": "command", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 79}, {"id": 11463, "label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 122}]}
{"text": "in other words you change the scale on both axes by the same factor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what i say is gee maybe you shouldnt write it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "why dont we say we introduce how about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so think of it as a change of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will write it like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can put here an  sign if you dont know what this meaningless arrow means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im making this change of variables and im describing it as an inverse substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course it wouldnt make any difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "its exactly the same as the direct substitution i started out with underscaling", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only difference is im not using different scales on both axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "im expanding them both equally", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what i mean by zoom", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happens to the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what happens to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore the ratio <expression> is the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the lefthand side becomes <expression> and the righthand side becomes <expression> of well <expression> is the same as <expression> over since ive scaled them equally this is the same as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11477, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 11478, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 11479, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 64}, {"id": 11480, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so its <expression> and the net effect is i simply everywhere i have an <expression> i change it to <expression> and wherever i have a <expression> i change it to <expression> which whats in a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the identical equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i havent changed the equation at all via zoom transformation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what makes it homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not an uncommon use of the word homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you say space is homogeneous every direction well that means i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "it means okay im getting into trouble there", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill let it go since i cant prepare any better i havent prepared any better explanation but this is a pretty good <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so suppose weve got a homogeneous equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our equation <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what substitution would you like to make", "entities": []}
{"text": "obviously we should make a direct substitution <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why did he say that this was going to be an example of inverse substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i wanted to confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but look thats fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you write it in that form youll know exactly what to do with the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is why everybody loves to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can testify for many years of looking with sinking heart at examination papers what happens if you try to make a direct substitution like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you say oh i need <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>  well i better use the quotient rule for differentiating that", "entities": [{"id": 11491, "label": "method", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "and it comes out this long and then either a long pause what do i do now", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its not at all obvious what to do at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "or much worse <expression> pages of frantic calculations and giving up in total despair", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason for that is because you tried to do it making a direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "all you have to do instead is use it treat it as an inverse substitution write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11494, "label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "whats the motivation for doing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its clear from the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this goes through all of mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "whenever you have to change a variable excuse me whenever you have to change a variable look at what you have to substitute for and focus your attention on that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay well then i better know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i know what <expression> is do i know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh of course", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i turned with that <expression> stroke the equation has now become <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i solve that", "entities": []}
{"text": "sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "that can be solved because this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just put the <expression> on the other side its <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11508, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 11509, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "and now this side is just a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "separate variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the only thing to watch out for is at the end the <expression> was your business", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve got to put the answer back in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets work an example of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "since i havent done any modeling yet this period lets make a little model differential equations model", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a physical situation which will be solved by an equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and guess what", "entities": []}
{"text": "the equation will turn out to be homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so the situation is as follows", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are in the caribbean somewhere a little isolated island somewhere with a little lighthouse on it at the origin and a beam of light shines from the lighthouse", "entities": []}
{"text": "the beam of light can rotate the way the lighthouse beams", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this particular beam is being controlled by a guy in the lighthouse who can aim it wherever he wants", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the drug boat which has just been caught in a beam of light and feels itd a better escape", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the lighthouse keeper wants to keep the drug boat the light is shining on it so that the us coast guard helicopters can zoom over it and do whatever they do to drug boats i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the drug boat immediately has to follow an escape strategy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the only <expression> that occurs to him is well he wants to go further away of course from the lighthouse", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand it doesnt seem sensible to do it in a straight line because the beam will keep shining on him", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand of course the lighthouse guy keeps the beam always on the boat", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its not clear its a good strategy but this is a differential equations class", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is whats the path of the boat", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the boats path", "entities": []}
{"text": "now an obvious question is why is this a problem in differential equations at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words looking at this you might scratch your head and try to think of different ways to solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what suggests that its going to be a problem in differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is youre looking for a path", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is going to be a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "a curve means a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are looking for an unknown function in other words", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what type of information do we have about the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its slope makes a constant known angle to a known angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you are trying to find a function and all you know is something about its slope that is a problem in differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets try to solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me draw just a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the horizontal", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets introduce the coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words theres the horizontal and heres the boat to indicate where i am with respect to the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the boat", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the beam and the path of the boat is going to make a <expression> degree angle with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the path that we are talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets label what i know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this angle is <expression> degrees", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets call this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what i want to know is what the slope of the whole path is", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats its slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its slope is the tangent of the sum of these <expression> angles <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what do i know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i know that the tangent of <expression> is how much", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words if this was the point <expression> this is the angle it makes with a horizontal if you think of it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the tangent of the angle is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> and theres a formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the hard part", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i get then", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> which is <expression> oh i like that combination <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there is no reason for doing anything to it but lets make it look a little prettier and thereby make it less obvious that its a homogeneous equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i multiply top and bottom by <expression> it looks prettier", "entities": [{"id": 11549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 11550, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 11551, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but notice that let step to make it look pretty has undone the good work", "entities": []}
{"text": "but here its a lot clearer that its a homogeneous equation because its already been written in the right form", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets solve it now since we know what to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to use as the new variable <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and with that lets solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the equation becomes <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11557, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and now as you realize putting it on the other side im going to have to turn it upside down", "entities": []}
{"text": "just as before if you have to turn something upside down its better to combine the terms and make it <expression> tiny little fraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "otherwise you are in for quite a lot of mess if you dont do this nicely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that will be <expression> on the lefthand side and on the righthand side <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 11573, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 49}, {"id": 11574, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "well thats ready to be integrated just as it stands", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about the term <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that integrates to be a logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is more or less the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "therefore i should put a minus sign and i should multiply that by half to make it come out right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is <expression> on the right hand side plus put in that arbitrary constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets now fool around with it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to remember your innocence although probably a lot of you are better calculators than i am", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to change this use as many laws of logarithms as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to put this in the exponent and put this on the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11588, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "or all the <expression> and the <expression> from the <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do you do that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what i could do let me just rewrite it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its gonna be <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11607, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so lets see we can multiply both sides by <expression> and lets see so then were gonna have that cancels with that if we treat it as just a value or as a variable", "entities": [{"id": 11609, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 11610, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "were gonna have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well were not quite done yet", "entities": []}

{"text": "and then were going to talk about related rates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so right now i want to give you some examples of maxmin problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to start with a fairly basic <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the thing about maxmin problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "the main thing is that were asking you to do a little bit more of the interpretation of word problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so many of the problems are expressed in terms of words", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in this case we have a wire which is length <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the problem is to find the largest area enclosed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in all of these cases in all these cases theres a bunch of words", "entities": []}
{"text": "and your job is typically to draw a diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> thing you want to do is to draw a diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case it can be fairly schematic", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres your unit length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when you draw the diagram youre going to have to pick variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are really the <expression> main tasks", "entities": []}
{"text": "to set up the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre drawing a diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is like word problems of old in grade school through high school", "entities": []}
{"text": "draw a diagram and name the variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well be doing a lot of that today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres my unit length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to choose the variable <expression> to be the length of <expression> of the pieces of wire", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes the other piece <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats pretty much the whole diagram except that theres something that we did with the wire after we cut it in half", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely we built <expression> little boxes out of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "like this these are our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and their side lengths are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have to think well we want to find the largest area", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i need a formula for area in terms of variables that ive described", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats the last thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill give the letter <expression> as the label for the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the area is just the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops that strange <expression> got in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the instinct that youll have and im going to yield to that instinct is we should charge ahead and just differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "well find the critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that those are important points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to find the critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words we take the derivative we set the derivative of a with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i do that differentiation i get the well so the <expression> <expression> <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i differentiate this i get well the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are <expression> minus signs in there ill let you ponder that differentiation which i did by the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "hang on a sec ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "just wait until were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "is there a problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so theres a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so its <expression> <expression> sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "which has an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so now this is  to <expression> if and only if <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation> or in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres our critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> is the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the critical value which is what you get when you evaluate <expression> at <expression> is <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were not done yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why arent we done", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we havent checked the end points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets check the end points", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in this problem the end points are really sort of excluded", "entities": []}
{"text": "the ends are between <expression> and <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the possible lengths of the cut", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what we should really be doing is evaluating in the limit so that would be the righthand limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you plug in <equation> what you get here is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11741, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly at the other end thats <expression> from the left we get <expression> which is also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what you see is that the schematic picture of this function and isnt even so far off from being the right picture here is that its level here as <expression> and then it dips down and goes up", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> this is <expression> and this level here is a half that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we did not find when we found the critical point we did not find the largest area enclosed", "entities": []}
{"text": "we found the least area enclosed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you dont pay attention to what the function looks like not only will you about half the time get the wrong answer youll get the absolute worst answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll get the <expression> which is the polar opposite from what you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have to pay a little bit of attention to the function that youve got", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this case its just very schematic", "entities": []}
{"text": "it dips down and goes up and thats true of pretty much most functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre fairly simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "they maybe only have <expression> critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "they only turn around once", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then maybe the critical point is the maximum or maybe its the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "or maybe its neither in fact", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well be discussing that maybe some other time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we find here is that we have the least area enclosed", "entities": []}
{"text": "enclosed is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is true when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and most when theres only <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is more or less the limiting situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> of the pieces disappears", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so thats the <expression> kind of example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just want to make <expression> more comment about terminology before we go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will introduce it with the following question", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lowest value of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer to that question is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the problem with this question and you will so that refers to the minimum value", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then theres this other question which is where is the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer to that is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theyre <expression> separate things", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the problem is that people are sloppy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and especially since you usually find the critical point <expression> and the value that is plugging in for a <expression> people will stop short and theyll give the wrong answer to the question for instance", "entities": []}
{"text": "now both questions are important to answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just need to have a word to put there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a little bit careless", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we say what is the minimum some people will say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats literally wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "they know what they mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its just wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when people ask this question theyre being sloppy", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "they should maybe be a little clearer and say whats the minimum value", "entities": []}
{"text": "or where is the value achieved", "entities": []}
{"text": "its achieved at or where is the minimum value achieved", "entities": []}
{"text": "where is min achieved would be a better way of phrasing this <expression> question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that it has an unambiguous answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when people ask you for the minimum point theyre also  so why is it that we call it the minimum point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this word critical point which is what <equation> is in critical value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so im making those same distinctions here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres another notion of a minimum point and this is an alternative if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats a point on the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the point  well so that graph is way up there but ill just put it on there", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might say min there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might point to this point and you might say max", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly this <expression> might be a max", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words what this means is simply that people are a little sloppy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and sometimes they mean <expression> thing and sometimes they mean another", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats a good  very good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go find the largest area enclosed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats sort of a trick question isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are various  thats a good thing to ask", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats sort of a trick question why", "entities": []}
{"text": "because according to the rules were trapped between the <expression> maxima at something which is strictly below", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words <expression> answer to this question would be and this is the answer that i would probably give is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not really true", "entities": []}
{"text": "because thats only in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression> or as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you like the most is when youve only got <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which breaks the rules of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so essentially its a trick question", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i would answer it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "because thats the most interesting part of the answer which is that its <expression> and it occurs really when <expression> of the squares disappears to nothing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets do another example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is since the question was what was the largest area why did we find the least area", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason is that when we go about our procedure of looking for the least or the most well automatically find both", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we dont know which <expression> is which until we compare values", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually its much more to your advantage to figure out both the maximum and minimum whenever you answer such a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "because otherwise you wont understand the behavior of the function very well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "we answered the question of what the largest and the smallest value was", "entities": []}
{"text": "also im wondering if you can check both the minimum  approaches ", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> can also use the question is can we use the <expression> derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is yes we can", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact you can actually also stare at this and see that its a sum of squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its always curving up", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a parabola with a positive <expression> coefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can differentiate this twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats an acceptable way of figuring it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill mention the <expression> derivative test again in this <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this is going to be another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is when i say minimum or maximum point which will i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just repeated the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is when i say minimum point what will i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is that for the purposes of this class i will probably avoid saying that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i will say probably where is the minimum achieved", "entities": []}
{"text": "just in order to avoid that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i actually sat at i often am referring to the graph and i mean this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill make this very clear when we were doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "however i just want to prepare you for the fact that in real life and even me when im talking colloquially when i say whats the minimum point of something i might actually be mixing it up with this other notion here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an example to get us used to the notion of constraints", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have so consider a box without a top", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you like were going to find the box without a top", "entities": []}
{"text": "with least surface area for a fixed volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the box without a top with least surface area for a fixed volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "the procedure for working this out is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "you make this diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you set up the variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well choose them in a kind of a standard way alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> i have to tell you <expression> more thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is something that we could calculate separately but im just going to give it to you in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that it turns out that the best box has a square bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats going to get rid of <expression> of our variables for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its got a square bottom and so lets draw a picture of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our box", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that goes down like this almost", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should get it a little farther down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our box", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets correct that just a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what about the dimensions of this box", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is going to be <expression> and this is very foreshortened but its also <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11809, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "the bottom is <expression> by <expression> its the same dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the vertical dimension is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to compute the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "the volume is the base is <expression> and the height is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the area the area is the area of the bottom which is <expression> thats the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there are the <expression> sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember theres no top", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats our setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres whats called a constraint here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely weve fixed the relationship between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that means that we can solve for <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have a which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is will you need to know this intuitively", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats something that i would have to give to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its actually true that a lot of things the correct answer is something symmetric", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this last problem the minimum turned out to be exactly halfway in between because there were sort of  demands from the <expression> sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly here what happens is if you elongate <expression> side you get less  it actually is involved with a <expression> variable problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if you have a rectangle and you have a certain amount of length associated with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the optimal thing you can do with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i wont in other words the optimal rectangle the least perimeter rectangle turns out to be a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the little subproblem that leads you to this square bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "but so that would have been a separate maxmin problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "which im skipping because i what to do this slightly more interesting <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres our formula for a and now i want to follow the same procedure as before", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely we look for the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "or points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we set that  <expression> we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11841, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 11843, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how did that happen to change into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "interesting guess thats wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are not done", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not done because we dont even know whether this is going to give us the worst box or the best box from this point of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets check the ends right away", "entities": []}
{"text": "to see whats happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "so can somebody tell me what the ends what the end values of <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"text": "where does <expression> range from", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the smallest <expression> can be yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the claim was that the largest <expression> could be <expression> because somehow theres this <expression> here and you cant get any further past than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a key feature here of this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that a is variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only thing thats fixed in the problem is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <expression> is fixed what do you know about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lower end point thats safe", "entities": []}
{"text": "because that has to do geometrically with the fact that we dont have any boxes with negative dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be refused by the post office definitely", "entities": []}
{"text": "over and above the empty top which they wouldnt accept either", "entities": []}
{"text": "its true that <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats using this relationship", "entities": []}
{"text": "but notice that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> to <expression> i just got a guess there over here thats right", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the upper limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is really important to realize", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is most problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "most problems the variable if it doesnt have a limitation usually just goes out to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is a very important end for the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its usually an easy end to the problem too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a possibility that if we push all the way down to <equation> well get a better box", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be very strange box", "entities": []}
{"text": "a little bit like our vanishing enclosure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe an infinitely long box also very inconvenient <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "might be the best box", "entities": []}
{"text": "well have to see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just take a look at what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were looking at <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <expression> with <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice right here this is going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is infinite", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that turns out to be a bad box", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take a look at the other end", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> <expression> going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again this term here means that this thing is infinite", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the shape of this thing ill draw this tiny little schematic diagram over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the shape of this thing is like this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so when we find that <expression> turnaround point which happened to be at this strange point <expression> <expression> that is going to be the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve just discovered that its the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is just what we were hoping for", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be the optimal box", "entities": []}
{"text": "now since you asked earlier and since its worth checking this as well lets also check an alternative justification", "entities": []}
{"text": "so an alternative to checking ends is the <expression> derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do not recommend the <expression> derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "i try my best when i give you problems to make it really hard to apply the <expression> derivative test", "entities": [{"id": 11885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 70}, {"id": 11887, "label": "method", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "but in this example the function is simple enough so that its perfectly ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take the derivative here remember this was whatever it was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take the <expression> derivative its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing is concave up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats consistent with its being the critical point is a min", "entities": []}
{"text": "is a minimum point", "entities": []}
{"text": "see how i almost said is a min as opposed to minimum point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so watch out", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre <expression> step ahead of me", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is is this the answer to the question or would we have to give <expression> and <expression> and so on and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this is something that i want to emphasize and take my time with right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "because it depends what kind of real life problem youre answering what kind of answer is appropriate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far weve found the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent found the critical value", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent found the dimensions of the box", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to spend a little bit more time on this exactly in order to address these questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and certainly if youre going to build the box you also want to know what the <expression> value is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> value is going to be lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the <expression> value", "entities": []}
{"text": "on top of that we could figure out the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats also a perfectly reasonable part of the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "depending on what <expression> is interested in you might care how much money its going to cost you to build this box", "entities": []}
{"text": "this optimal box", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you plug in the value of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11906, "label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11910, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so if you like <expression> way of answering this question is these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be the minimum point corresponding to the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be the answer to this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the reason why im carrying it out in such detail is i want to show you that there are much more meaningful ways of answering this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me explain that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me go through some more meaningful answers here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that happens to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want to expand the volume youll have to expand the area by the <expression> of the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other dimensionless quantity is the <expression><expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again thats inches divided by inches", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its <expression> which happens to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is actually the best answer to the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it shows you that the box is a <expression><expression> box", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is <expression> and this is <expression> thats the good box", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is just the shape if you like and its the optimal shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "and certainly that aesthetically thats the cleanest answer to the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was a question right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "could you repeat that i couldnt hear", "entities": []}
{"text": "im wondering if youd be able to get that answer if you  square", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is could we have gotten the answer if we werent told that the bottom was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is yes in <expression> with multivariable", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would have to have <expression> letters here an <expression> a <expression> and a <expression> if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youd have to work with all <expression> of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i separated out into <expression> theres a separate <expression> variable problem that you can do for the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this is a <expression> <expression> variable problem for this other thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its just <expression> consecutive <expression> variable problems that solve the multivariable problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "why did i divide <expression> by <expression> rather than <expression> by <expression> or in any", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again what i was aiming for was dimensionless quantities", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> and <expression> are measured in the same units", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also the proportions of the box", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats another word for this is proportions", "entities": []}
{"text": "are something thats universal independent of the volume <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its something you can say about any box at any scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "whether it be you know something by cristo in the common", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe well get in here to do some fancy", "entities": []}
{"text": "the proportions is with geometric problems typically when theres a scaling to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "where the answer is the same at small scales and at large scales", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is capturing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why the ratios are whats capturing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats why its aesthetically the nicest thing to ask", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what exactly does the ratio of the <expression> to the <expression> ratio  tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "unfortunately this number is a really obscure number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is what does this tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only thing that i want to emphasize is whats on the lefthand side here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you do this for example in general with planar diagrams circumferenced area is a bad ratio to take", "entities": []}
{"text": "what you want to take is the square of circumference to area", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the square of circumference has the same dimensions that is say inches squared to area", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is in square inches", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again its these dimensionless quantities that you want to cook up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and those are the ones that will have universal properties", "entities": []}
{"text": "the most famous of these is the circle that encloses the most area for its circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again thats only true if you take the square of the circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "you do the units correctly", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were here weve got a shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve got an answer to this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i now want to do this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets put it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted to do this problem by a different method", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think ill take the time to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to do this problem by a slightly different method here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres example 2 by implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the same example but now im going to do it by implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well ill tell you the advantages and disadvantages to this method here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the situation is you have to start the same way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is the starting place of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the goal was the minimum of a with <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was the situation that we were in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what i want to do is just differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "the function <expression> is implicitly a function of <expression> so i can differentiate the <expression> expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that yields <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 11960, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so this is giving me my implicit formula for <expression> so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or in other words <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i also have the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you may notice im not using primes quite as much", "entities": []}
{"text": "because all of the variables are varying and so here im emphasizing that its a differentiation with respect to the variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 11967, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so again this is using the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can plug in for what <expression> is which is right above it", "entities": [{"id": 11969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so lets gather that together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> and then altogether this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the same thing as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> goes to the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this i claim so you have to decide for yourself", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i claim that this is faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "its faster and also it gets to the heart of the matter which is this scale in variant proportions", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is basically also nicer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it gets to the nicer answer also", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are the advantages that this has", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its faster and it gets to this im going to call it nicer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the disadvantage is it did not check", "entities": []}
{"text": "whether this critical point is a max min or neither", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we didnt quite finish the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we got to the answer very fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so it gives you a candidate", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is  so the question is how would you check it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is that for this particular problem the only way to do it is to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words it doesnt save you that much time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but with many many examples you actually can tell immediately that if the <expression> ends the thing is say <expression> and inside its positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "things like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in many many cases this is just as good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to change subjects here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the subject that im going to talk about next is almost is very very closely linked", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i talked about implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to just talk about dealing with lots of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and rates of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so essentially were going to talk about the same type of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to tell you about a subject which is called related rates", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is really just another excuse for getting used to setting up variables and equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "related rates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres my example for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this is going to be a police problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is going to be a word problem and  sorry im dont want to scare you no police", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there are police in the story but theyre not present", "entities": []}
{"text": "so but im going to draw it immediately with the diagram because im going to save us the trouble", "entities": []}
{"text": "although you know the point here is to get from the words to the diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the road", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre coming along here in your lets see in your car going in this direction here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the police have radar", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is bouncing off of your car", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what they read off is that youre <expression> feet away", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the question is are you speeding", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the threshold here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i want to do now is show you how you set up a problem like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> and because its the distance to a straight line you know that this is a right angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that this is a right triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the question is how do we put the letters in to make his problem work to figure out what the rate of change is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now let me explain that right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will actually do the computation next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> thing is you have to understand whats changing and whats not", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now an important distance here is the distance to this foot of this perpendicular", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to name that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to give that letter <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> is varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason why i need a letter for it as opposed to this <expression> is that its going to have a rate of change with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact its related to the question is whether <expression> is faster or slower than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the thing thats varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres something else thats varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "this distance here is also varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need a letter for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we do not need a letter for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its never changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "were assuming the police are parked", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not ready to roar out and catch you just yet and theyre certainly not in motion when theyve got the radar guns aimed at you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need to know something about the sociology and style of police", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need to know things about the real world", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how fast youre approaching", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats measured along the radar gun", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim that thats d by dt of this quantity here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> is also changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why we needed a letter for it too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so next time well just put that all together and compute <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> correction from last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry to say i forgot a very important factor when i was telling you what an average value is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont put in that factor its only half off on the exam problem that will be given on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i would have gotten half off for missing out on this factor too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember you have to divide by <expression> here certainly when youre integrating over <expression> to <expression> the riemann sum is the numerator here", "entities": [{"id": 12006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "this was meant to illustrate this idea that were dividing by the total here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we are going to be talking about average value in more detail", "entities": []}
{"text": "not today though", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this has to do with average value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well discuss it in considerable detail in a couple of days i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "now today i want to continue", "entities": []}
{"text": "and anyway its very important to write it down on the board twice because you want to see it at least twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "and many more times as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says that the derivative of an integral gives you the function back again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way id like to use it today i started this discussion last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we didnt get into it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is something thats on your problem set along with several other examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that we can use this to solve differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in particular for example we can solve the equation <equation> with this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely using an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the function <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that formula can be taken to be the starting place for the derivation of all the properties of the logarithm function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were going to do right now is were going to take this to be the definition of the logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we do that then i claim that we can read off the properties of the logarithm just about as easily as we could before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so ill illustrate that now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are a few other examples of this where somewhat more unfamiliar functions come up", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is <expression> that in theory we know something about", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> property of this function is the <expression> thats already given", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely its derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get a lot of information just out of the fact that its derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other thing that we need in order to nail down the function besides its derivative is <expression> value of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its really not specified by this equation only specified up to a constant by this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there were getting the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the case with all these definite integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you evaluate them at their starting places the value will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and together these <expression> properties specify this function <expression> uniquely", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the next step is to try to think about what its properties are", "entities": []}
{"text": "now notice that when you have a function which is given as an integral its <expression> derivative is really easy to compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its <expression> derivative well you have to differentiate whatever you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it may or may not be easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "here its relatively easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are the properties that im going to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wont really use very much more about it than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then to get started with the graph since i see i have a value here which is <equation> im going to throw in the value of the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> which i know is <expression> of <expression> thats reading off from this equation here so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im ready to sketch at least a part of the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a sketch of the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the tangent line i know has slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the curve is concave down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "incidentally its also increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats an important property its strictly increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we can get from this the following important definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "which again is working backwards from this definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can get to where we started with a <expression> in our previous discussion", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if i take the level here which is <equation> then that crosses the axis someplace", "entities": []}
{"text": "and his point is what were going to define as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the definition of <expression> is that its the value such that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again the fact that theres exactly <expression> such place just comes from the fact that this <expression> is positive so that <expression> is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "no theres just <expression> other feature of this graph that im going to emphasize to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres <expression> other thing which im not going to check which you would ordinarily do with graphs", "entities": []}
{"text": "once its increasing there are no critical points so the only other interesting thing is the <expression>s", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it turns out that the limit as you go down to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you go over to the right here its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does get arbitrarily high it doesnt level off", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im not going to discuss that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead im going to just remark on <expression> qualitative feature of the graph which is this remark that the part which is to the left of <expression> is below <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just want to remark why is <expression> for <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i dont have room for that so ill just put in here <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to give you <expression> reasons", "entities": []}
{"text": "just that the property that <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you read that backwards if it gets up to <expression> here it must have been negative before <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> way of seeing that <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a <expression> way of seeing it which is equally important", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it has to do with just manipulation of integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "here im going to start out with <expression> and its definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to reverse the order of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i can tell that this quantity is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason that i can tell is that this chunk of it here this piece of it is a positive number", "entities": []}
{"text": "this part is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this part is positive because <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is less than the <expression> and so this is interpreted", "entities": []}
{"text": "the thing in the green box is interpreted as an area", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <expression> is <expression> <expression>s <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so both of these work perfectly well as interpretations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its just to illustrate what we can do", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres <expression> more manipulation of integrals that gives us the fanciest property of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the last <expression> that im going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you have a similar thing on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to prove that this is as i say the fanciest property of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on your homework by the way youre going to check that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well do this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea is just to plug in the formula and see what it gives", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the lefthand side i have <expression> to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then thats certainly  to the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to now split this into <expression> pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is a property of integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "that if you have an integral from <expression> place to another you can break it up into pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to start at <expression> but then go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to continue from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the question that we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent proved this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this <expression> is actually true", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we want this to be true we know by definition <expression> is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know we can see it that <expression> is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question that this boils down to is we want to know that these <expression> things are ", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to know that <expression> is that other integral there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets check it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to rewrite the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the integral from  sorry from <expression> a to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now again to illustrate properties of integrals the key property here that were going to have to use is change of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a kind of a scaled integral where everything is <expression> from what we want to get to this <expression> quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this suggests that we write down <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 12123, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "thats going to be our trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive now substituted in for the integrand", "entities": []}
{"text": "but on top of this with definite integrals we also have to check the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the limits work out as follows", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <equation> thats the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that <expression>  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <equation> this is if and only if", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this lower limit which really in disguise was where <equation> becomes where <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the upper limit here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if you notice were just going to cancel these <expression> factors here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we recognize that this is just the same as the definition of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <expression> is over here in the box", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is what we wanted to show", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last example that im going to discuss of this type i already mentioned last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "it really is not any function that you can express in terms of the functions that we know already", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the approach always to these new functions is to think of what their properties are", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we think of functions in order to understand them is to maybe sketch them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so im going to do exactly the same thing i did over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it that i can get out of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well immediately i can figure out what the derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i read it off from the fundamental theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i also can figure out the value at the starting place", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case the starting place is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the value is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i should check the <expression> derivative which is also not so difficult to compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now i can see that this function is increasing because this derivative is positive its always increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its going to be concave down when <expression> is positive and concave up when <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "because theres a minus sign here so the sign is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is less than <expression> when <expression> is positive and greater than <expression> when <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe to get started ill remind you <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also true that <expression> that just comes right out of this <equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means the tangent line again has slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we do this a lot with functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "we normalize them so that their slopes of their tangent lines are <expression> at convenient spots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the tangent line of slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know this thing is concave down to the right and concave up to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so its going to look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "with an inflection point", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "really you want to know this graph as well as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so there are just a couple more features", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the property that turns out that this function is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats known as an odd function", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason why its odd is that its the antiderivative of something thats even", "entities": []}
{"text": "this function in here is even", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we nailed it down so that it was <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way of interpreting that and let me show it to you underneath is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we look at its derivative its derivative course is the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this shape here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see the slope is <expression> but fairly close to <expression> but positive along here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its getting this is its steepest point", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the highest point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its leveling off again the slope is going down always positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the interpretation of the function thats up above is that the value here is the area from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is area <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill color it in decorate it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this area here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want to show you this odd property by using this symmetry", "entities": []}
{"text": "the graph here is even so in other words whats back here is exactly the same as whats forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now theres a reversal", "entities": []}
{"text": "because were keeping track of the area starting from <expression> going forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we go backwards its counted negatively", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we went backwards to  <expression> wed get exactly the same as that green patch over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "wed get a red patch over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it would be counted negatively", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the property that its odd", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can also check this by properties of integrals directly", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be just like this process here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its completely analogous to checking this formula over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> of the comments i wanted to make about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why does this save us a lot of time if we know this is odd", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know that the shape of this branch is exactly the reverse or the reflection if you like of the shape of this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we want to do is flip it under the axis and then reflect it over that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the symmetry property of the graph of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last property that i want to mention is whats happening with the ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at the end theres an asymptote theres a limit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an asymptote", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same thing down here which will be exactly because of the odd feature thisll be exactly negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the opposite value over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might ask yourself what level is this exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that level turns out to be a very important quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "its interpreted down here as the area under this whole infinite stretch", "entities": []}
{"text": "its all the way out to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do you think it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre all clueless", "entities": []}
{"text": "well maybe not all of you youre just afraid to say", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the square root of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was right on the tip of your tongue wasnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so this is actually very unobvious but its a very important quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its an amazing fact that this thing approaches this number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its something that people worried about for many years before actually nailing down", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what i just claimed here is that the limit as <expression> approaches <expression> of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly if you do it to <expression> youll get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for this reason people introduce a new function because they like the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this function is <expression> short for error function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its <expression> times the integral from <expression> to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words its just our original our previous <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the function which gets tabulated quite a lot", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see it on the internet everywhere and its a very important function", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are other normalizations that are used and the discussions of the other normalizations are in your problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> of them and another <expression> is in your exercises", "entities": []}
{"text": "the standard normal distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are tons of functions like this which are new functions that we can get at once we have the tool of integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill write down just <expression> or <expression> more just so that youll see the variety", "entities": [{"id": 12212, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "heres <expression> which is called a fresnel integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "on your problem set next week well do the other fresnel integral well look at this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these functions cannot be expressed in elementary terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> on your homework for this week was this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> comes up in fourier analysis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to just tell you maybe <expression> more such function", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a function which is called <expression> logarithmic integral of <expression> which is this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reciprocal of the logarithm the natural log", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the significance of this <expression> is that <expression> is approximately  the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact if you can make this as precise as possible youll be famous for millennia because this is known as the riemann hypothesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "exactly how closely this approximation occurs", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its a hard problem and already a century ago the prime number theorem which established this connection was extremely important to progress in math", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "is this stuff youre supposed to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "i love that question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is this is so we launched off into something here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me just explain it to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to be talking a fair amount more about this particular function because its associated to the normal distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to let you get familiar with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "what im doing here is purely cultural", "entities": []}
{"text": "well after this panel what im doing is purely cultural", "entities": []}
{"text": "just saying theres a lot of other beasts out there in the world", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> of them is called <expression> of ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well have a just a very passing familiarity with <expression> or <expression> of these functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there are literally dozens and dozens of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only thing that youll need to do with such functions is things like understanding the derivative the <expression> derivative and tracking what the function does", "entities": []}
{"text": "sketching the same way you did with any other tool", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to do this type of thing with these functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill have to lead you through", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i wanted to ask you a question about <expression> of these functions i have to tell you exactly what im aiming for", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah i did", "entities": []}
{"text": "i called these guys fresnel integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "the guys name is fresnel", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just named after a person", "entities": []}
{"text": "but and this <expression> lis logarithmic integral its not named after a person", "entities": []}
{"text": "logarithm is not somebodys name", "entities": []}
{"text": "so look in fact this will be mentioned also on a problem set but i dont expect you to remember these names", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular that you definitely dont want to try to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is will we prove this limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is yes if we have time", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll be in about a week or so", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not going to do it now", "entities": []}
{"text": "it takes us quite a bit of work to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to change years now im going to shift gears", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to go back to a more standard thing which has to do with just setting up integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this has to do with understanding where integrals play a role and they play a role in cumulative sums in evaluating things", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is much more closely associated with the <expression> fundamental theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is well take today we were talking about how integrals are formulas for functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "or solutions to differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to go back and talk about integrals as being the answer to a question as opposed to", "entities": []}
{"text": "what weve done now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words and the <expression> example or most of the examples for now are going to be taken from geometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "later on well get to probability", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> topic is just areas between curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a couple of curves that look like this and maybe like this and you want to start at a place a and you want to end at a place <expression> then you can chop it up the same way we did with riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "and take a chunk that looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to write the thickness of that chunk", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets give these things names", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the thickness", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the height is the difference between the top value and the bottom value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is if you like base times  whoops backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is height and this is the base of the rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are approximately correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course only in limit when this is an infinitesimal is it exactly right", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order to get the whole area i have add these guys up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to integrate from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12241, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "thats summing them thats adding them up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats going to be my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the story here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me just say <expression> things about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all on a very abstract level before we get started with details of more complicated problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> is that every problem that im going to be talking about from now on for several days involves the following collection of the following goals", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to identify something to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats called an integrand", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to identify what are known as the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "the whole game is simply to figure out what <expression> <expression> and this quantity is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the minute we have that we can calculate the integral if we like", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have numerical procedures or maybe we have analytic procedures but anyway we can get at the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "the goal here is to set them up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to set them up you must know these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> the <expression> and what were integrating", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you leave <expression> of these out its like the following thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i ask you what the area of this region is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i left out this end how could i possibly know", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont even know where it starts so how can i figure out what this area is if i havent identified what the left side is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cant leave out the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "its sitting here in this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i need to know where it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i need to know the top and i need to know this side", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i dont incorporate them into the information ill never get anything out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i need to know everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i need to know exactly those things in order to have a formula for the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when this gets carried out in practice as we will do now in our <expression> example its more complicated than it looks", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is our <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me make sure that i chose the example that i wanted to", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres a <expression> step in figuring these things out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is that you must draw a picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont draw a picture youll never figure out what this area is because youll never figure out whats what between these curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> curve <equation> is a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its pointing this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its this parabola here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes through this place here which is <expression> over and has slope <expression> so it does this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this shape in here is what we mean by the area between the curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that we see what it is we have a better idea of what our goal is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you havent drawn it you have no hope", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to describe <expression> ways of getting at this area here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> <expression> is motivated by the shape that i just described right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely im going to use it in a straightforward way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to chop things up into these vertical pieces just as i did right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now heres the difficulty with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the difficulty is that the upper curve here has <expression> formula but the lower curve shifts from being a part of the parabola to being a part of the straight line", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that there are <expression> different formulas for the lower function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the only way to accommodate that is to separate this up into <expression> halves", "entities": []}
{"text": "separate it out into <expression> halves", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to have to divide it right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "questionso youre <expression> step ahead of me", "entities": []}
{"text": "well also have to be sure to distinguish between the top branch and the bottom branch of the parabola which were about to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we will do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the top part", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill call it top", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are pink and i guess this is blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so now lets see whats happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "well really im going to have to figure out <expression> points i claim", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to have to figure out where this point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "where this point is and where that point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "could you speak up", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is why do we need to split up the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think in order to answer that question further im going to have to go into the details of the method and then youll see where its necessary", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> step is that im going to figure out what these <expression> points are", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is kind of easy its the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can identify them by the following equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to see where these curves intersect", "entities": []}
{"text": "at what well if i plug in <equation> i get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 12295, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "and then i can solve this quadratic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is telling me that <equation> or <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive found <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means this point down here has <expression> entry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to square this <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12305, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so thats the formula for this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other point has <expression> entry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again with his formula <equation> i have to <expression> to get <expression> so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i claim i have enough data to get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need the top the bottom left and the bottom right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the top is the formula for this branch of <equation> which is in the positive <expression> region", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bottom curve part of the parabola so this is the bottom left is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the other branch of the square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is exactly what you were asking before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is we have to distinguish between these <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the point is these formulas really are different", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last bit is the bottom right chunk here which is this pink part", "entities": []}
{"text": "bottom right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im ready to find the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the left part plus the right part", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to figure out what the range of <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> im going to  well lets leave ourselves a little more room than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to be safe", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok heres the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i need to figure out the starting place and the ending place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the starting place is the leftmost place", "entities": []}
{"text": "the leftmost place is over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to travel from this vertical line to the green line", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the difference between the orange curve and the blue curve is what i call top and bottom left over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is what i call top and this was bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "but only the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim thats giving me the left half of this the left section of this diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to do the right section of the diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "i start at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lower limit is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i go all the way to this point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the last bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats going to be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the upper limit here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have to take the difference between the top and the bottom again", "entities": []}
{"text": "the top is <expression> all over again", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the bottom has changed", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bottom is now the quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "please dont forget your parenthesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres going to be minus signs and cancellations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is almost the end of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rest of it is routine", "entities": []}
{"text": "we would just have to evaluate these integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and fortunately im going to spare you that", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not going to bother to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the easy part", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not going to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to show you that theres a much quicker way with this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and with this area calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "the quicker way is what you see when you see how long this is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other device which ill draw over here schematically", "entities": []}
{"text": "no maybe ill draw it on this blackboard here", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw the picture at least schematically", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres our picture that we had before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now instead of slicing it vertically im going to slice it horizontally", "entities": []}
{"text": "like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the dimensions have different names", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the principle is similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "the width we now call <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this distance here from the left end to the right end we have to figure out what the formulas for those things are", "entities": []}
{"text": "so on the left maybe ill draw them color coded again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whoops orange is right i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the left which is this green", "entities": []}
{"text": "is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the right which is orange is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to use this its going to turn out that we want to write <expression> as we want to reverse roles", "entities": [{"id": 12343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so we want to write this as <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so well use it in this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to set up the integral for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "this time the <expression>  an integral in the <expression> variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its starting place is down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its ending place is up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the lowest value of <expression> and this is the top value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and weve already computed those things", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lowest level of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this top value is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this goes from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the difference is this distance here the distance between the rightmost point and the leftmost point", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the <expression> dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again its a rectangle but its horizontal is long and its vertical is very short", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what are they", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the difference between the right and the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "what was the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is it right minus left", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats very important", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is it right minus left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats actually the point that i was about to make", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression> which is the right is bigger than <expression> which is the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you do it backwards youll always get a negative number and youll always get the wrong answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the righthand end minus the lefthand end gives you a positive number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its not obvious actually where you are", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres another doublecheck by the way", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you look at this quantity you see that the ends pinch", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly the crossover points", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats not an accident thats exactly the geometry of the shape that we picked out there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the technique", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is a much more routine integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that this is <expression> evaluated at <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which if you work it out is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were done for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "and tomorrow well do more volumes more things including <expression> dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "then laxfriedrichs if youve noticed has a sort of jagged profile", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe youve realized why that would be", "entities": []}
{"text": "somehow laxfriedrichs kind of operates on a staggered grid", "entities": []}
{"text": "well see actually with ive drawn a staggered grid here so i can say what i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally upwind is also smeared out", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess i was so pleased to see these actually showing on the website and that makes me think of more questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe you too", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all as time goes forward we see this bump beginning to appear", "entities": []}
{"text": "so am i right in thinking that it reaches a certain height and stays there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess im thinking about sort of further questions because every time you do a numerical experiment good additional question show up", "entities": []}
{"text": "ultimately itd be great to be able to predict what it would be", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular does that bump reach a certain height", "entities": []}
{"text": "because you can see it just barely forming and then you see it growing to a certain point", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be does it approach a steady profile", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that height settle down", "entities": []}
{"text": "itd be fantastic to be able to predict that height", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example you always want to know how do things depend on the parameter", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> parameter we have in this problem is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would be computing that value exactly from this value at exactly the right slope on the characteristic and perfection", "entities": []}
{"text": "now as <expression> goes away from <expression> i presume it goes down below <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be on that kind of a staggered grid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so leapfrog youd think of it right away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you see right away the <expression>s cancel", "entities": [{"id": 12409, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "the delta <expression> the <expression> is our old ratio <expression> so this is easily written in terms of <expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does have this <expression> time step issue and of course we have to think about stability", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the dependence on <expression> would be a the profile dependence on <expression> would be a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just emphasize whats the goal", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i say that this upwind <expression> is smeared out i mean that it doesnt satisfy what you really hope for", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just see what this means", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this says figure out the space differences so this this minus this and this minus this and then take the time difference of those", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i see what ill get if i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thatll be this <expression> minus this <expression> and this <expression> plus this <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12469, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 36}, {"id": 12471, "label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "do you see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we have here is <expression> at this point minus <expression> at this point minus <expression> at this point plus <expression> at this point plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12477, "label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": 12478, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 53}, {"id": 12480, "label": "command", "start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 150}, {"id": 12481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 118}]}
{"text": "i claim that we have the same thing here that if i take the time differences <expression> can i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of taking the space differences <expression> ill take this <expression> this time difference this minus this and ill subtract im taking now the space difference ill subtract are you with me", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in a way this throws light on something thats probably something that we take for granted but we wouldnt want to be pressed on too closely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so having that identity allows me to do exactly what i did with the continuous case there and show that this when i eliminate the half levels ive got ordinary leapfrog", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll be leapfrog", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course here we have a <expression> and here a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so altogether an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats leapfrog", "entities": []}
{"text": "so can i summarize leapfrog", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember we had <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason it was a quadratic was there were <expression> time steps involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "we handled that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got stability if <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that led us to a in <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that led us to <expression> ill just remember those steps a less or  <expression> and that let us to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do we have coming up", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe important to say whats coming up", "entities": []}
{"text": "specifically the blackscholes equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you probably know that a lot of effort and a lot of money are going into the valuation of options and other financial derivatives and that this blackscholes equation beautifully produced the heat equation and additional correction terms will produce a convectiondiffusion equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an application that we wouldnt have made some years ago but now its worth focusing on that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its interesting in itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so nonlinear wave equations and those are called conservation laws", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats after these linear cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im ready to tackle the heat equation starting then on to the next section of the notes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me tackle it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the heat equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we already see the big difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres a <expression> <expression> but only a <expression> derivative in time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it will be <expression> comparable with <expression> and thats a very significant difference because thats if <expression> is small <expression> is extremely small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> is constrained by <expression> were looking at small time steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "were looking at stiff systems absolutely", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be a stiff problem because the low frequencies and the high frequencies differ enormously in the decay rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact why dont we see it right away starting as always with exponentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i plug in <expression> and <equation> separating variables as always", "entities": [{"id": 12547, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see thats a very big difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "the difference is enormous here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> energy conserved", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation> energy dissipated", "entities": []}
{"text": "we had a ratio <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now when i put that into here let me just do it <expression> is <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is the pure exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "simple as always because we have constant coefficients but highly informative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess another thing that i read off of that is what frequencies are decaying fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "high frequencies", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is large <expression> is very large and <expression> to the <expression> is decaying very quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so highfrequency noise in this system roughness discontinuities are going to get smoothed out strongly by moving forward in time", "entities": []}
{"text": "physically whats happening is we have our wavefront which stayed a perfect step function in the wave equation will instantly smear", "entities": []}
{"text": "so diffusion smears discontinuity", "entities": []}
{"text": "heat travels", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were back over here if the temperature starts out as <expression> on this side and <expression> on this side then in an instant some heat flows from right to left", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact it flows with infinite speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i now want to write down staying with the differential equation what do we want to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did the exponential case and learned a good bit from that the fast decay of high frequencies", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next step would be to put different frequencies different <expression>s together", "entities": []}
{"text": "by linearity we can add these solutions we can multiply that by any numbers we want depending on <expression> we still have solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can integrate over <expression> so we will actually", "entities": [{"id": 12582, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "that that will be the next step", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write down what that does", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to jump take a little jump here to put on the board what i just said in words", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can multiply this <expression> to the <expression> <expression> to the <expression> thats whats happening to the pure frequency <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12588, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "if i multiply that by the amount of that frequency which is in the initial condition so here is the initial condition <expression> and ive taken its fourier transform", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tells me how much of frequency <expression> is in the problem is in the initial problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tells me how much of frequency <expression> is in the initial problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive said that in words but actually we could just check it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we would like to know that this lefthand side solves the heat equation and we would like to know that it has the correct start the correct <expression> of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets check that", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> at the start this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it does start out correctly", "entities": []}
{"text": "should i say that again", "entities": []}
{"text": "it inverts this transform that we took", "entities": []}
{"text": "secondly does it solve the heat equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you might say ok perfection", "entities": []}
{"text": "do we need finite differences", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is typical of formulas that give the answer exactly but in terms that are not numerically convenient", "entities": []}
{"text": "because to use his formula <expression> of all this this requires an integral an infinite integral to find integral to find for <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to use this formula wed have to find this transform and then we have to do this integral for the inverse transform this integral for the answer <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> infinite integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and not to mention the fact that on a finite interval when <expression> doesnt go all the way from <expression> to <expression> we have to think all over again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a nice formula for the answer but it looks nice but its not numerically terrific", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can get a lot of information out of this and theres <expression> other special solution thats also extremely informative", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if so im going to do a special case but its the big case", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if the initial conditions is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if the initial condition is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "an impulse at time <expression> <equation> an instant source of heat at a point a point source with finite strength you could say", "entities": []}
{"text": "an impulse at times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the wave equation what happened", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was like turning on a flash of light and it went along the characteristics", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the heat equation itll be quite different", "entities": []}
{"text": "there arent characteristics here but this is an extremely important solution and i think you could call it the fundamental solution to the heat equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you may know what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "you may have seen this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "its fantastic that we get a formula for this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could say weve got a formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the fourier transform whats <expression> of <expression> for the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the fourier transform of the <expression> is a constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all frequencies are there in  amounts", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a constant so i can remove it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im left with a specific integral to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the question is can i do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer turns out to be yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can do that integral when this is a constant and that will give you the answer with that starting value", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just say what that answer is", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the key part of the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a solution which starts from a <expression> spreads of course and the shape as it spreads is a bell", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then always here comes that scalar tells us the width of the bell", "entities": []}
{"text": "how far has it spread at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what goes there is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where theres a heat component that goes into the system and theres a work component", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess if i dont write the sums the summation convention is assumed", "entities": []}
{"text": "now having gotten this fundamental relation we can manipulate and write it in different fashion", "entities": []}
{"text": "rather than <expression> we would get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and clearly for this <expression> the natural variables are <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there were other types of these functions that we construct", "entities": []}
{"text": "and by taking various derivatives of equilibrium functions with respect to each other we can express other ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "and via this methodology we can relate to many different things to each other and have mathematical relations between physical observables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so following up on that we then ask what are some other mathematical forms that we can look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and importantly that told us that the intensive variables were not independent of each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you had relationship that you <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that was for a gas isotherm", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the analogue of hydrostatic work for a gas was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12692, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "if you have <expression> component it goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we said that this gives us the relationship along an isotherm", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill come back to that shortly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets start with our initial equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for simplicity lets think of cases where we have a fixed number of particles so that we can write <expression> as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12703, "label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "so this looks like this df that i wrote before for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression> with respect to <expression> at constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an example of the maxwell relation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just to remind you we can always invert these derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do i calculate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> does not appear as a <expression> derivative here but certainly appears as a <expression> derivative here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can look at the <expression> derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want to take a derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12668, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}, {"id": 12670, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "but i want the <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as i said i dont really care what the name of these functions is", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will get converted to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can get rid of the minus sign if i want and i have the answer that i want", "entities": [{"id": 12766, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 12768, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and you can go and construct anything else that you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i know", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh i want to have <expression> in the play so now i have to add <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 12816, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "thats good because i have <expression> as a <expression> derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have <expression> as a <expression> derivative whereas i want <expression> to appear as the work element something like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i will do is i will make this <expression> of <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this converts this to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats fine except that when i do things now i would have calculated things at constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to calculate things at constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not really important", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my maxwell relation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why didnt i get this result", "entities": []}
{"text": "did i make a mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "louder", "entities": []}
{"text": "is this valid for extensive systems", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes this is valid for extensive system", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used extensively in the relation of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i never used extensivity", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i have a system that i tell you its pressure and temperature how is its volume related to the number of particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a box in this room", "entities": []}
{"text": "i tell you pressure and temperature are fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i make the box twice as big number of particles volume will go twice as big", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to apply extensivity i would have to conclude that this is the same thing as <expression> and i would be in agreement with what i had before", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the constraint of constant <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually constraint of constant <expression> <expression> is important because we said that said there it is a kind of gibbsduhem relation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that constraint is the <expression> that tells me that once you have set <expression> and <expression> which are the <expression> variables that i have specified here you also know m<expression>u", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is you know all the intensive quantities", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats whats the condition that i used over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it is only so let me reemphasize it this way i will write <expression> is the same thing as <expression> only if i have <expression> <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i had here <expression> for example i wouldnt be able to use this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was going to build this equation to say look at the elements of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in particular we had that for the certain changes that i wont repeat the change in entropy to be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you are in equilibrium you have this relationship between equilibrium state functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next item that we are going to look at is what are the consequences of having underlying this equality between functions of state some kind of an inequality about certain things being possible and things not being possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that relates to stability conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i find it easier to again introduce to you these stability conditions by thinking of a mechanical analogue", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets imagine that you have some kind of a spring and that this spring has some kind of a potential energy that i will call phi as a function of the extension x", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that its some nonlinear function such as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is no reason why we should use a hook and spring but something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we also discussed last time what happens if i were to pull on this with some force <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i pull on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to make it in the vertical direction you can imagine this as being the potential energy of the mass that was pulling on the spring", "entities": []}
{"text": "once essentially the kinetic energy has disappeared my spring stops oscillating and goes to a particular value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and mathematically that corresponds to subtracting a linear function from this", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually what will it look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets not make this go flat but go up in some linear fashion so that at least i can draw something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i need to do is to minimize this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but especially if you have a spring that has the kind of potential that i drew for you you start increasing the so basically what it says is that you end up at the place where the slope is  the derivative of the potential function", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens if you start increasing this slope if it is a nonlinear type of thing at some point you can see its impossible", "entities": []}
{"text": "essentially its like a very flat noodle", "entities": []}
{"text": "you pull on it too much and then it starts to expand forever", "entities": []}
{"text": "it only depends on the potential energy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says independent of the force that you apply", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this portion of the curve is in principle physically accessible", "entities": []}
{"text": "the portion that corresponds to essentially changing the curvature and going the other way theres no way theres no force that you can put that would be able to access those kinds of displacements", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is this convexity condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you will have the potential energy as a function of many variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "this matrix is positive definite", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just <expression> component that i have been focusing on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so ultimately im going to try to generalize that to this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> thing that i dont quite like in this form is that im focusing too much on the displacements", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is written appropriately using this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have seen over here that whether or not i express things in terms of the displacements or in terms of entropy temperature conjugate forces et cetera these are all equivalent ways of describing the equilibrium system", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to do a slight manipulation of this to make that symmetry between forces and displacements apparent", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre related by this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i were to make a change in <expression> there will be a change in the position of the equilibrium", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can get that by doing a corresponding cange in the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the corresponding change in the derivative is the <expression> derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im saying is that this is a condition that relates the position to the forces", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i make a slight change in the force there will be a corresponding slight change in the position", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the changes in the position and the force given by this equilibrium condition are related by this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you can see that that sum is already present here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really if you go back and i use this condition and do manipulations that are compatible to this you will come up with exactly this stability condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have that in the notes", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is somewhat more mathematically complicated than this because the derivatives involve additional factors of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you have to do slightly more work but you will ultimately come with the same expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "you say why is that of any use", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is possible that youve already seen a particular use of this expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets even be simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "look at the case where <expression> is <expression> <equation> which means that i have a fixed amount of gas at a particular temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could have for example a box in this room which is in equilibrium at the same temperature as the temperature of the room", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its volume im allowed to adjust so that the pressure changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in that process at a particular temperature i will be finding a particular curve in the pressure volume space", "entities": []}
{"text": "this has to be a decreasing function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a curve where <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine you say", "entities": []}
{"text": "nothing surprising about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it turns out that if you cool the gas the shape of this isotherm can change", "entities": []}
{"text": "it can get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there is a critical isotherm at which you see a condition such as this where theres a point where the curve comes with <expression> slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you say that for that particular critical isotherm occurring at <expression> if i were to make this expansion the <expression> term in this expansion is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you say ok lets continue and write down the <expression> term <expression> at constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the problem is that if i multiply this by <expression> which would have made this into <expression> i have a problem because delta v can be both positive or negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can go <expression> direction or the other direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a term that is a cubic can change sign can sometimes be positive can sometimes be negative depending on the sign of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is disallowed by this condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you say ok exactly what have you done here", "entities": []}
{"text": "what you have done here is youve drawn a curve that locally looks like a cubic with the appropriate sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you probably have used this for calculating critical points of van der waals and other gases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will do that ourselves", "entities": []}
{"text": "that statement in order to fully understand and appreciate you have to come to next term where we talk about phase transitions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "essentially this stability condition tells you a lot of things about signs of response functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "it wants to be contracted", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly here you are essentially compressing the gas", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a thermal analogue of that sine which is worth making sure we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets look at the case where we have a fixed number of particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what we would have is that our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am free to choose any set of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "the interesting set of variables well ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i can take a look at this expression and choose any set of variables to express these changes in terms of", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to choose for my variables temperature and xi", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i choose to use <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i substitute these <expression> and <expression> in the general form of the stability condition to get constraints applicable to combinations involving <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so i have to multiply <expression> with <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13009, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "i have to multiply <expression> with <expression> here", "entities": [{"id": 13012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here <expression> is not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then which <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that i have <expression> that is a function of i have <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13020, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so here i would have derivatives <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would have derivatives <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in both cases <expression> is kept fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case additionally <expression> is kept fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case additionally <expression> is kept fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that multiplication", "entities": []}
{"text": "we multiply a <expression> here and we get <expression> at constant <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 13031, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "so what i will do is i will look at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to turn this into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> at constant <expression>  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "its taking the things in this fashion which is <expression> at constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can see that the sum total of these <expression> terms is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly what i have here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this for any choice of <expression>s and <expression>s for any choice it better be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in particular given this nice form that i have over here i can certainly choose all of the delta <expression>s to be <expression> because i do things at constant displacement", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what i have is that the whole thing is proportional to delta t squared and some coefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so entropy should always be an increasing function of temperature at constant displacement", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the consequence of that is that heat capacities measure at constant displacement", "entities": []}
{"text": "the general definition is you put some amount of heat into the system at constant displacement", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to specify the procedure by which heat is applied to the system and see how much this temperature changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can in principle do this sufficiently stability so i can measure precisely the changes in temperature infinitesimally", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> at constant <expression> is precisely the entity that we have looked at to be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the same way that a spring is stable if you pull on it its extension should increase a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the coefficient that relates the change in displacement corresponding to the change in force has to be positive for stability", "entities": []}
{"text": "heat capacities must have this positivity in the sense that if you add heat to a system its temperature should go up", "entities": []}
{"text": "it it went the other way it would actually also violate the <expression> law of thermodynamics", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "im a bit confused about the <expression> notation that we used", "entities": []}
{"text": "the initial equation that we start has only it deals with <expression> but where does <expression> come from", "entities": []}
{"text": "this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "which equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so index <expression> is just a dummy variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets start from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and part of the confusion is that im not really consistent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i meant here is that there may be multiple ways of doing work on the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there could be pressure there could be spring there could be magnetic work", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i do mechanical work on the system the change in energy is the sum total of all different ways to do mechanical works plus the heat that is supplied to the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to add all of these things together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if im again inconsistent this is really what i mean that when you do a change in a function of multiple variables you would write it as <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13091, "label": "command", "start_offset": 127, "end_offset": 138}]}
{"text": "if you use the summation convention i have to really sum over all possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> of the derivatives here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i took another derivative or i looked at the change in this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "this function depends also on variables <expression> through <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to look at the sum over all changes with respect to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that automatically i have kind of assumed some of these things as i write things rapidly", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if it is not clear you have to spend a little bit of time writing things more in detail because its after all kind of simple algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes did i make another mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh not a mistake just yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you were talking about mechanicals you had a nonlinear spring", "entities": []}
{"text": "you start pulling on it", "entities": []}
{"text": "at some point it just increases", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it is a nonlinear spring yes thats right", "entities": []}
{"text": "can you provide example of thermodynamic system which upon some threshold action upon it becomes unstable", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think i more or less had that example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to develop it a little bit further", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i said that typically if i look at the pressure volume isotherms of a gas it looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i told you that there is actually some kind of a critical isotherm that looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you may ask well what do things look below that for lower temperatures", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again you probably know this is that this is the temperature below which you have a transition to liquid gas coexistence", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the isotherms would look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it turns out that while these are true equilibrium things you would have to wait sufficiently long so that the system explores these isotherms it is also possible in certain systems to do things a little bit more rapidly", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you go below you will see a kind of remnant of that isotherm which kind of looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that isotherm would have portions of it that dont satisfy these conditions of stability", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason that you still get some remnant of it not quite the entire thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get actually some portion here some portion here is because you do things very rapidly and the system does not have time to explore the entire equilibrium", "entities": []}
{"text": "but even the nonlinear noodle you cannot really see in equilibrium", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can only see it when youre pulling it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see that it is being extended", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is no equilibrium that you can see that has that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i want to find an analogue of that nonlinear noodle showing instability id better find some nearequilibrium condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the nearequ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now that weve spent some time thinking about what a differential equation is and even visualizing solutions to a differential equations using things like slope field lets start seeing if we can actually solve differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "as well see different types of differential equations might require different techniques and some of them we might not be able to solve at all using analytic techniques", "entities": []}
{"text": "wed have to resort to numeric techniques to estimate the solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets go to what i would argue as the simplest form of differential equation to solve and thats whats called a separable", "entities": []}
{"text": "separable differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that we have the derivative of <expression> with respect to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 13103, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 13104, "label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "so we have this differential equation and we want to find the particular solution that goes through the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i encourage you to pause this and ill give you a hint", "entities": []}
{"text": "perhaps you can find the particular solution to this differential equation that contains this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you cant do it dont worry because were about to work through it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i can multiply both sides times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13153, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 13154, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so i can multiply both sides times <expression> that has the effect of putting the <expression>s on the left hand side and then i can multiple both sides times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 13159, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 13160, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 104, "end_offset": 118}, {"id": 13161, "label": "command", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 142}, {"id": 13162, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 143, "end_offset": 153}]}
{"text": "i can multiple both sides times <expression> and we kind of treat you can treat these differentials as you would treat a variable when youre manipulating it to essentially separate out the variables", "entities": [{"id": 13164, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}, {"id": 13165, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and so this will cancel with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we are left with <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually let me write it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13171, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "actually i might need a little more space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why is this interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we could integrate both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this also highlights why we call it the separable", "entities": []}
{"text": "you wont be able to do this with every differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you wont be able to algebraically separate the <expression>s and <expression>s on <expression> side and the <expression>s and <expression>s on the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this <expression> we were able to", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats why this is called a separable differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "hey can i separate the <expression>s and the <expression>s and as i said this is not going to be true of many if not most differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now that we did this we can integrate both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill find a nice color to integrate with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to integrate both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you integrate the left hand side what do you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get and remember were integrating with respect to <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be <expression> and we could put some constant there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if youre integrating that thats going to be ", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the right hand side were integrating with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if that was a <expression> there and if you dont want to change the value of the integral you put the <expression> right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "this <expression> right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> and then of course i might have some other constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what can i do here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well have a constant on the left hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an arbitrary constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont know what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent used this initial condition yet we could call it", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are both constants arbitrary constants and we dont know what they are yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we could just rewrite this as on the left hand side we have <expression>  on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 13208, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 13209, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "ill write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13211, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "let me write that in blue just because i wrote it in blue before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now this is kind of a general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me separate it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was a part of this original expression right over here but using this initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it tells us when <equation> <expression> needs to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we would have <expression> which is just <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is gonna be <expression> and just like that were able to figure out if you subtract <expression> from both sides <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 13229, "label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 88}, {"id": 13230, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"text": "so the relationship between <expression> and <expression> that goes through this point we could just set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 13234, "label": "command", "start_offset": 101, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"text": "so thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we are left with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can multiply both sides by <expression> and were going to get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 13241, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were gonna get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can take the square root of both sides and you can say well look you know <expression>  this so <expression> could be  the <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but they gave us an initial condition where <expression> is actually positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were finding the particular solution that goes through this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this was a <expression> then we would say <expression> is the <expression> but we know that <expression> is the <expression> its the principal root right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me do that a little bit neater so we can get rid of whoops", "entities": []}
{"text": "i thought i was writing in black", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can get rid of this right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "were only going to be dealing with the positive square root so we could write <expression>  <expression> and that of course  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now today we get to move on from integral formulas and methods of integration back to some geometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is more or less going to lead into the kinds of tools youll be using in multivariable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same as we did with riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the way that were going to approximate this is by taking the straight lines between each of these points", "entities": []}
{"text": "as things get smaller and smaller the straight line is going to be fairly close to the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the main idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just depict <expression> little chunk of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> some increment there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i can figure out what the length of the orange segment is", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the horizontal distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the vertical distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the formula is that the hypotenuse is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is approximately that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were saying is that <expression> is approximately this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its very close to the length of the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the whole idea of calculus is in the infinitesimal this is exactly correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats whats going to happen in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the basis for calculating arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to rewrite that formula on the next board", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to write it in the more customary fashion", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve done this before a certain amount", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i just want to emphasize it here because this handwriting is a little bit peculiar", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i really mean is to put the parenthesis around it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we square it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for whatever reason people have gotten into the habit of omitting the parentheses", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre just going to have to live with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and realize that this is not <expression> or anything like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly this is a single number and this is a single number", "entities": []}
{"text": "infinitesimal", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just the way that this idea here gets written in our notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the <expression> time were dealing with squares of infinitesimals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its just a little different", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the form in which i always remember this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets put it in some brightly decorated form", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is as i say the way i remember it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there are other ways of thinking of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets just write a couple of them down", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> is that you can factor out the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13300, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "so that looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i factored out the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13303, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so this is a variant", "entities": []}
{"text": "in practice its also very often written informally as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula for arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as i say i remember it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "but youre going to have to derive various variants of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll have to use some arithmetic to get to various formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there will be more later", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the question is is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is no", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets just see what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example if <equation> which is an example which will come up in a few minutes then <equation> and <equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whereas <equation>  if i differentiate this another time its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they dont mean the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same thing over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see this <expression> this is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the quantity squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words this thing is supposed to mean the same as that", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is you got a little nervous because i left out these limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed i did that on purpose because i didnt want to specify what was going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course if you write it in terms of another variable you put that variable in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what we do when we change variables right", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have many different choices for these limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the clue as to which variable we use", "entities": []}
{"text": "correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> are not the same thing as <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what <expression> and <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> and <expression> are mileage markers on the road", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when we measure arc length remember its mileage along the curved path", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i need to give you some examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my <expression> example is going to be really basic", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i hope that it helps to give some perspective here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to take the example <equation> which is a linear function a straight line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> would  <expression> and so <expression> is going to be the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 13344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "which is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "of the graph is going to be the integral from <expression> to <expression> of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which of course is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "not very surprising", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just draw a picture of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is something which has slope <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this horizontal is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the vertical is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the dimensions of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula for the hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly the same as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe youre saying duh this is obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the point that im trying to make is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you can figure out these formulas for linear functions calculus tells you how to do it for every function", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we can break things up into these little infinitesimal bits", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the whole idea of all of the methods that we had to set up integrals here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the main point of these integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so lets do something slightly more interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you like thats the graph of a semicircle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe well set it up here this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that the semicircle goes around like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well start it here at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well go over to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well take this little piece of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so down to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the portion of the circle that im going to measure the length of", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we know that length", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to give it a name im going to call it <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>s the arc length along the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets figure out what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in order to do this i have to figure out what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats a calculation that weve done a number of times", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to do it slightly faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have the derivative of whats inside the square root", "entities": []}

{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "which is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve just figured out a geometric interpretation of whats going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is that we went a distance alpha along this arc", "entities": []}

{"text": "this is the <expression> time youre deriving it", "entities": []}

{"text": "then we defined the exponential in terms of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is the same sort of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats really happening here is that if you want to know what radians are you have to calculate this number", "entities": []}

{"text": "and thats looking better", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 173, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "this over here would be <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "now we are getting much closer to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again fancy notation but its asking something pretty pretty pretty simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is my calculator and you could numerically say ok whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this entire time the function whats a getting closer and closer to", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so notice graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 192, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "and then let me draw <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 194, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "this is <expression> and this ones <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and our <expression> is going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the limit as were approaching <expression> were getting closer and closer and closer to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its saying as <expression> gets closer and closer to <expression> as you get closer and closer and this isnt a rigorous definition well do that in future videos", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not actually going to be exactly <expression> this calculator just rounded things up but going to get to a number really really really really really really really really really close to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can do something from the positive direction too", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i did if i got really close <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> what is that approaching as we get closer and closer to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once again thats a numeric way of saying that the <expression> from either direction of <equation> even though right at <expression> the function  <expression> because its discontinuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i would say well youre almost true the difference between <equation> and <equation> right over here is that <equation> can never  <equation> when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> squared", "entities": [{"id": 221, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "when <expression>  <expression> so lets say that and im not doing them on the same scale but lets say that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation> right up there i could do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as <expression> approaches <expression> from this side from the lefthand side or from numbers less than <expression> <expression> is approaching values approaching <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <expression>  <expression> lets say right side is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 266, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}, {"id": 267, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "if you just follow along the curve as you approach <expression> you get closer and closer to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "in another presentation ill give you the more formal mathematical you know the deltaepsilon definition of a limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the expression <expression>  <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now well lets think about the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now its almost the same as this curve except something interesting happens at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 274, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "i just i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this graph kind of goes its just <expression> but instead of <expression>  <expression> <expression> drops down to <expression> but then we keep on going", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> looks something like let me use a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats my introduction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets say i had the limit and ill explain what a limit is in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says <expression> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is pretty easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "we draw a hole because its not defined at <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression>  <expression> <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets evaluate the expression <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 292, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "let me pick a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now all this is saying is what value does the expression <expression> approach as <expression> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a limit is saying as <expression> approaches <expression> from both sides from numbers left than <expression> and from numbers right than <expression> what does the expression approach", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me define <equation> when if <expression> does not  <expression> and lets say it  <expression> when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so its just like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its exactly <expression> until we get to <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually in the very next module im now going to do a bunch of problems involving the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 322, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "similarly as you go from the righthand side make sure my things still working", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an equally neatlooking graph as the one i just drew", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 325, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "in this case the limit as you approach the expression  evaluating the expression of that value", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a gap in the graph which maybe could be called a grap", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case the limit isnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me maybe give you one wrinkle on that and hopefully now youll start to see what the use of a limit is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> looks something like this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me ask you a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets get started with some well first an explanation before i do any problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then as we go into drill derivatives and integrals youll actually understand why people probably even invented limits to begin with", "entities": []}
{"text": "for some reason my brain is working functionally", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i had let me make sure i have the right color and my pen works", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think as you do more and more problems youll get more and more of an intuition as to what a limit is", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome to the presentation on limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might i think already see where this is going and be wondering why were even going to the trouble of learning this new concept because it seems pretty obvious but as <expression> as we get to <expression> closer and closer to <expression> from this direction and as we get to <expression> closer and closer to <expression> to this direction what does this <expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that gap and that gap is defined right here what happens when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <equation> axis of course", "entities": []}
{"text": "so going back to the limit problem what is the limit as <expression> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre probably saying sal this seems like a useless concept because i could have just stuck 2 in there and i know that if this is say this is <expression> that if <expression>  <expression> that <expression>  <expression> and that would have been a nobrainer", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think now youre starting to see why the limit is a slightly different concept than just evaluating the function at that point because you have functions where for whatever reason at a certain point either the function might not be defined or the function kind of jumps up or down but as you approach that point you still approach a value different than the function at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "now normally this would be on this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me graph <expression> now", "entities": [{"id": 345, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "but at <expression>  <expression> and <expression>  <expression> we draw a little hole", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is approaching <expression> as <expression> approaches <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this will give you intuition for what a limit is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should it doesnt look completely right below it but i think you got to get the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "well see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a slight variation on this expression right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well then <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see this graph is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the way you write it is you say the limit oh my color is on the wrong ok let me use the pen and yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 360, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so as you can see as we go closer and closer and closer to <equation> <expression> of whatever number that is approaches <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a gap in the graph and then we keep and then after <expression>  <expression> we keep moving on", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you go from the righthand side you go along the curve and <expression> is also slowly approaching <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i go along the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it essentially  <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is interesting because in this case the <expression> does not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we look at let me at least draw a graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way i think about it is as you move on the curve closer and closer to the expressions value what does the <expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to go this is how i visualize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill stay in this yellow color", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 373, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "this is actually right below this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its like an <expression> curve like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is our new <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well for every value other than <expression>  <expression> you could actually cancel this and this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you very soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}]}

{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then ill show you how to solve this analytical", "entities": []}

{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill go with red", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we saw when <equation> its undefined", "entities": []}
{"text": "its undefined right so heres a case just like what we saw in that first video where the limit actually cant  what the expression  when you substitute <expression> for the number youre trying to find the limit of because you get an undefined answer", "entities": []}

{"text": "now my computers breaking down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we keep going to the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <expression> the graph is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> comes from the lefthand side what does <expression>  well <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that we hopefully have a little bit of an intuition of what a limit is or finding the limit of a function is lets do some problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll probably give you the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what happens when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and do we know what <expression> is well no", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right and you can also try what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well since were just starting with these limit problems let me draw a graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw a line here so you dont get messed up with all of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 420, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so lets say that this is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 422, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so the first thing i would always try to do is just say what happens if i just stick x straight into this expression what happens well whats <expression> when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if were going to do the limit we can just visually say well as x let me do another color now", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the same thing as <expression> and then all of that is over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if using the limit we can come up with a better answer for what its approaching", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think this is going to give you the intuition for what were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel out <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so for every other value other than <expression> the value of this of <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as long as this <expression> and this <expression> dont  <expression> it actually turns out that this function lets say this is <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets say <equation> i think here it might be useful to draw this graph of <equation> because itll give you a visual reason a visual represent actually lets do it both ways", "entities": [{"id": 454, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "you actually just tend to ask what the limit is and this is the way you could solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i draw a graph these are the axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so clearly when <equation> we dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> until we get to exactly <expression> right and similarly when we go from the other hand its the exact same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "some of these you might actually see on your exams or when youre actually trying to solve a general limit problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually another way that you could i mean i often used to check my answers when i used to do it is you could take a calculator and try in what happens when what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im going to try to solve this and in the very next video im going to continue on with this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill actually see you in the next presentation while i figure out why my pen isnt working and then well continue with this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but unless youre asked to you tend not to be asked for a formal solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right because what you want to do is you want to say well what does the <expression>  when i get really close to <expression> and then you could keep going closer and closer to <expression> and see what the <expression> approaches and in this case youll see that it approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so really we see that <equation> when <expression> does not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me see whats a good lets say my expression is ill put it in parentheses so its cleaner", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how would we graph <equation> we showed that <expression>  <expression> when <expression> does not  <expression> and <expression> is <expression> when <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "isnt that the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "substitute <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so theres a hole there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youll see and ill make sure you see it visually here that the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the denominator <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to rewrite this <expression> in a way that maybe i can simplify it", "entities": [{"id": 487, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "actually ill do the graphical and the analytical at the same time", "entities": []}
{"text": "somethings wrong with my tool", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say lets do it the pickingnumbers method because i think thatll give you an intuition and maybe itll help us draw the graph of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and evaluate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 490, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so lets say what is the limit once again my pen is not working", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> this is <expression> this is <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> you get positive <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again obviously you cant just put <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this graph lets draw <equation> and if you have a graphing calculator you should experiment it looks something like this", "entities": [{"id": 502, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so when you go from the lefthand side <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i might actually do a separate presentation on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so from the negative side it approaches <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 506, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "i dont know if you can see the <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you see as <expression> approaches <expression> from the negative direction we get larger and larger or i guess you could say smaller and smaller negative numbers right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 512, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so in this situation ill draw the graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 514, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and as we gets closer and closer to <expression> it spikes up and it goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because for the first time <expression> is a legitimate answer to your problem which i dont know on some metaphysical level got me kind of excited", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> squared is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is as <expression> approaches <expression> from the positive direction from the righthand side well this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets write <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 525, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "but anyway i will do more problems in the next presentation because you can never do enough limit problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say just keeping that last problem we had in mind <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as i approach <equation> from this direction right from this direction what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get you know if its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll get <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as we get to smaller and smaller as we get closer and closer to 0 from the negative side it approaches infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok hopefully my tool is working now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then as we see from what we drew as we approach <equation> we asymptote and we approach <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can just evaluate <equation> yourself right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway so we were saying when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this notation just says the limit as i approach from the negative side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly from positive numbers if you go out to the right really far it approaches <expression> but its still going to be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> is point the thing is frozen again when its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> so were getting closer and closer to <expression> from the negative side <equation> <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as you see as you approach <expression> from the negative direction you get larger and larger negative values or i guess smaller and smaller negative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is why i got excited when i first started learning limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the limit as <expression> this pen this pen the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly if i put if we say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 733, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "evaluate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 547, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "square both sides of <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 550, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so here no matter what value we put into x we get a positive value right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you go from the righthand side it also goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in a couple of presentations i actually give you the formal kind of rigorous mathematical definition of the limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can see this dark blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes to <expression> as you approach <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you go from the positive direction you get larger and larger values", "entities": []}
{"text": "so regardless of whether we put a negative or positive number here we get a positive value", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you put minus you could actually oh let me do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean we could say that from the positive side its positive infinity or from the negative side its negative infinity but they have to  the same thing for this limit to be defined", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll be instructive i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "let us evaluate <expression> youll get <expression> and if we put <expression> youll get <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 558, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "<expression> youd get <expression> <expression> and then <expression> and then <expression> you could imagine the closer and closer you get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly when you go from the other direction when you say what is when <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the limit in general  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as we go from the positive side these are actually symmetric although i didnt draw <equation> that symmetric it also approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "square <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 571, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "so when <expression> is a <expression> as <expression> gets really really really negative as <expression> is like <expression> this is approaching <expression> but its still going to be a slightly negative number", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> there you get <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a case in which the limit oh thats not too bright", "entities": []}
{"text": "you never quite get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another problem and i think this should be interesting now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since im approaching a different value when i approach from one side or the other this limit is actually undefined", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me graph <equation> just to give you a sense of what this graph looks like because this is actually a good graph to know what it looks like just generally", "entities": [{"id": 582, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so in this situation you actually have as <expression> approaches so let me give you a different notation which youll probably see eventually", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see what if there is a limit here youll see what its going to", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to make these sweeping statements", "entities": []}
{"text": "we still get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well usually wed be done", "entities": []}
{"text": "my pen tool is malfunctioning again", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you just substitute <equation> in there", "entities": [{"id": 587, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so its interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do one more", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to think about what happens as you get really large values of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this case these dont matter anymore and then these two <expression> terms grow at the same pace right and theyll always be kind of growing in this ratio of <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats going to grow faster <expression> or <expression> well yeah <expression> going to grow a lot faster than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "evaluate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 598, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "well now this is pretty easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i really encourage you if you have a graphing calculator graph these <equation> that were doing and see and show yourself visually that its true that the limit as you approach say <expression>  <expression> actually does approach the limits that were solving for", "entities": [{"id": 602, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "i know that i kind of just hand waved but thats really how you think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing i like to do whenever i see any of these limits problems is just substitute the number in and see if i get something that makes sense and then wed be done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know what youre thinking", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way you could do it is we divide <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 605, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in the denominator here we set it to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 610, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 611, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "so you could prove it to yourself", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the previous example we saw that it evaluated out when you simplified <equation> to <expression> and in this example it came out to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the denominator whats the fastestgrowing term well in the denominator the fastestgrowing term is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the limit here is actually that easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we have the <equation>>", "entities": [{"id": 617, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so that was interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that this is the same thing as that looks like its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we get a good number", "entities": []}
{"text": "simplify <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 620, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "cross out <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 622, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "if the function is continuous wed be done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and make up your own problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course its very important to remember that this expression is <expression> at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we get the answer after we simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 626, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "well lets define the numerator as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 628, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 629, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so thats the same thing as the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or <expression> well thats a real number so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if theyre the same term then they kind of cancel out and you say the limit approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "evaluate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 636, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "ok lets replace the denominator with <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 638, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 639, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "hell thats what im doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "it actually looks like its <expression> but were just going to write <expression> which is of course <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 643, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "see what happens when <equation> see what happens when <equation> and i think youll get the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do one that i think is pretty interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could actually divide this rational expression <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 648, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "set the denominator to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 650, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 651, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so this denominator as you get larger and larger and larger values of <expression> is going to grow a lot faster than that numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do this fast so i can confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "then lets evaluate the right hand side of <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 654, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 655, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "then cancel out <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 658, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and we can say and im not being very rigorous here but this is kind of how its taught and i think you get the intuition that this is the same thing as the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these problems kind of look confusing sometimes but theyre really easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first time we did it we got the answer <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we dont like having <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no lets say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 684, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "but the way i think about it is in the numerator kind of the fastestgrowing term here is the <expression> right this is the fastestgrowing term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what you do is you just figure out whats the fastestgrowing term on the top whats the fastestgrowing term on the bottom and then figure out what it approaches", "entities": []}
{"text": "so sometimes you might get a more complex thing that isnt as easy to factor as this but a good starting point is to guess that one of the factors is going to be in the bottom expression because thats kind of the trick of these problems to just simplify the expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get that this is just the same thing as the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once again we get <expression> and we have to do something to this maybe to simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 691, "label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "now lets just try to stick the <expression> in and see what we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once again if we assume that <expression> does not  <expression> and this <expression> would not be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 698, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "lets do some more limit examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you can see i do all this in my head and im prone to mistakes", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a very nonrigorous way of doing it but it gets you the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could imagine if the denominators growing much much much faster than the numerator as you get larger and larger numbers youre going to get a smaller and smaller and smaller fraction right its going to approach <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well as you get really large values of <expression> these small terms these ones that dont grow as fast as these large terms kind of dont matter anymore right because youre getting really large values of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 703, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and so as you go to <expression> it approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "well once again if we just evaluate <equation> lets see what happens when <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 710, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "let me clear this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets factor out the top of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 712, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 713, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "whats the <equation> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way i think about these problems as they approach <expression> just think about what happens when you get really really really large values of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get another problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we put the <expression> in the numerator we get <expression> which is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we factor out <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 724, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 725, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "and kind of a cheating way of doing this is if you have a calculator even if you dont have a calculator put in huge numbers here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course theres nothing we can do to change the fact that this function or this expression is <expression> at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  the <expression> right and this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the third one shed given me", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats happening here lets see this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because you can only to not change the value of something you can only multiply <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 737, "label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "and the reason why and what were going to do is were going to multiply <expression> by the conjugate of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 740, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 70}, {"id": 741, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 86}, {"id": 742, "label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "and we have a problem here still", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can divide the numerator and the denominator by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 744, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 745, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 47}]}

{"text": "whats the numerator factored lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "well since were taking <expression> to <expression> and this is what you normally do what you take <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "and so that  <expression> right ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i remember that by saying its not intuitive", "entities": []}
{"text": "subtract <expression> from <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 866, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}

{"text": "im just going in the other direction right so assuming youre comfortable with that everything under the radical sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember anything you do in the numerator you have to do in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this one just like previous problems more than knowing your precalculus or your calculus you need to know your trig identities", "entities": []}
{"text": "im doing this on memory", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats <expression> <expression> is <expression> right so <expression> which is <expression> thats also <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "and then when you take and then of course when you divide something like this by <expression> and you take it to <expression> this will approach <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so lets do them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why does why is that normal why is that useful because we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i might not get the exact numbers shed given me but hopefully i get the exact properties", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that trig problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually thats the first thing you should have done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and really these harder limit problems theyre all about kind of knowing your algebra and your trigonometry really well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing when you want to do when you try a limit problem is well you just try to substitute <expression> into <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 892, "label": "command", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 102}, {"id": 893, "label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"text": "essentially we get the conjugate of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 895, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "now lets do one more problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we cant just multiply it right we have to multiply <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 898, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "as you go to <expression> this term will get really big", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could put <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what can we do well this is where your break out the trig or you brush off your memory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so anyway we divide <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 903, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}

{"text": "and really to do this you have to know a little bit of a trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we are going to do is going to multiply <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 915, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 917, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same thing as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we see a <expression> in the numerator and the denominator that are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we assume that <expression> isnt <expression> its just approaching <expression> we can divide the numerator and the denominator by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  <expression> which simplifies to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were actually dividing by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets multiply <expression> by the conjugate of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 930, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 931, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}, {"id": 932, "label": "method", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "then divide <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 935, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so it becomes this is the <expression> right i hope you understand why were dividing by <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you just evaluate the <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 939, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and in this case our highest degree terms is <expression> right we have an <expression> here and an <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now whats the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "evaluate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 945, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and it seems like this term would overpower this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets divide the numerator and the denominator by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 948, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 949, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "im just dividing the numerator and the denominator by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats <expression> squared thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just doing a little arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression> im just doing a little on the side here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe it approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have what do we have we have cosine well we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "clear image", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets multiply <expression> by the conjugate of <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 959, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 960, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}, {"id": 961, "label": "method", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "replace <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 964, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "and <expression> so cotangents the opposite", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is  what thats  <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just so you know how to manipulate these functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i thought it was worthwhile to make videos on the problems that she had to figure out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and nine times out of 10 when you see a problem like this the solution because both the numerator and the denominator look factorable is to factor the numerator and the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we end up with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if we take the <expression> and we put it into the radical sign it becomes <expression> right this is the same thing as you can say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so for all other values we can divide those because those are going to be the same values", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "replace <expression> by <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 974, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 975, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "and we cant just multiply that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that becomes a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "otherwise youre changing the value", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i remember that its not intuitive", "entities": []}
{"text": "well our factoring of <equation> paid off", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you look at this youre like well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i remember them correctly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is always less than <expression> right so any <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i draw <equation> it would have to be in between those two right so no matter how i draw <equation> if i were to draw <equation> its bounded by those two functions just by definition", "entities": [{"id": 986, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 987, "label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 88}, {"id": 988, "label": "command", "start_offset": 113, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"text": "so thats right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its not defined at that point but the limit as we approach <expression> also has to be at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to do that one because this is a super useful limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because once you understand what the squeeze theorem is we can use the squeeze theorem to prove this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets keep that in the back of our mind the squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont get it maybe you just want to memorize this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we will use that to prove that the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well see in the next video that the squeeze theorem is tremendously useful when were trying to prove this", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this video i will prove to you that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now <expression> could look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and none of these <equation> actually have to even be defined at <expression> as long as these limits this limit exists and this limit exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before i do that before i break into trigonometry im going to go over another aspect of limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats also an important thing to keep in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe <expression> doesnt have to be defined right there but the limit as we approach it is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we have <expression> thats the point that we care about", "entities": [{"id": 1003, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "thats just the dependent access and this is the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "because thats a very useful limit to know later on when we take the derivatives of trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually im going to do it in the next video since were already pushing 8 minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and hopefully that makes a little bit of sense and hopefully my calories example made a little bit of sense to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets draw <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so it has to go through that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me let me graph <equation> for you", "entities": [{"id": 1008, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so you can call it <expression> <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1013, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "its actually a pretty involved explanation but i think youll find it pretty neat and satisfying if you get it", "entities": []}
{"text": "or at least the limit  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does this tell us <expression> is always greater than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or at least it has to approach that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other thing is sometimes you learn the squeeze theorem youre like oh well thats obvious but when is it useful and well see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the squeeze theorem the squeeze theorem is my favorite theorem in mathematics possibly because it has the word squeeze in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me graph <equation> and ill do it in a different color", "entities": [{"id": 1020, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "but when you invert both sides of <equation> you switch the inequality right", "entities": [{"id": 1021, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 1022, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and the same logic in the first and fourth quadrants and thats where were dealing with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the xaxis something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats  so just do this part right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always in between the dark blue and the light blue line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going from <expression> all the way to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this triangle that im tracing in green what is the area of that triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i want to draw another right from that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you might feel were getting close", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a little bit bigger than the triangle we just figured out right", "entities": []}
{"text": "draw a couple of more things just to set up this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it would be  we could take this if we say that this is the right triangle it would be this length the opposite of <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in another color", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me ask you a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this red line is always in between it so it also approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is always positive we can get rid of the absolute value signs there and just write that", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "the green triangle the area of the green triangle so <expression> thats the area of the green triangle its less than the area of this wedge", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats close enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase all of this down here now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the fourth quadrant <expression> is negative <expression> is negative and the angle is negative so <expression> is also negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "right like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1036, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "let me see if i can graph <equation> thing", "entities": [{"id": 1038, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "now when is this true", "entities": []}
{"text": "erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this area right hand side is going to be  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the unit circle right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it and actually we have to go with obviously they got our trigonometry and its actually a visual proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "divide both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1040, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1041, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "just so you believe me", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway back to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said that <expression> is always greater than <expression> which is always greater than <expression> between negative <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if this angle is <expression> radians what fraction of that is out of the entire unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill draw <equation> like that", "entities": [{"id": 1049, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so that first small triangle that green triangle we did is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that may be the most obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might want to think about it a little bit why it doesnt change anything in the second quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me draw <equation> <equation> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1056, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "because this looks a lot like this its just inverted", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this green triangle here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "that should erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "this light blue line right here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <equation> the radius is <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1079, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "whats this base of this larger triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "we cant forget this though", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im running out of space so let me erase some of this stuff up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill trace it in green", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write <equation> down", "entities": [{"id": 1064, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that hopefully gives you a little intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if that doesnt make sense to you think about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry thats the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first let me pick a relatively small triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the area of this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the length of that line", "entities": []}
{"text": "or another way of saying it <expression>  the left side over <expression> or <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but whats the adjacent length", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it should be clear just looking at this diagram no matter where i drew this top line that this green triangle has a smaller area than this wedge which has a smaller area than this large triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is always going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre both less than the area of this large triangle right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets go like right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well expand <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we are using the squeeze theorem based on this and this", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me ask you a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then right from this point i want to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the right hand side  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1075, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "lets see if we can play around with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do that in magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the height of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take the absolute value of everything in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1081, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 1082, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 31}, {"id": 1083, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "so its going to be a positive again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are ready to use the squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me ask you a slightly harder one", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill show you the graph of <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1085, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "our formula is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and hopefully this makes sense to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets take the area of that larger triangle of this big triangle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted to do it right from this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "will there ever be a time when <expression> is in the first or the fourth quadrant is there ever a time that <expression> is a negative expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you go negative as long as we take the absolute value then the distance will still hold and we still have positive areas and all that kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "this blue line right here thats the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is the area of not that green triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> between <expression> or the fourth and the first quadrants the red line is always in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "right hand side is going to be  the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1093, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 1094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "well first of all what happens when you invert <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1096, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "lets see let me see if i can i should draw <equation> pretty big", "entities": [{"id": 1098, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "now lets think about the area of a couple of parts of this figure that ive drawn here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that another way to view it as this line gets smaller and smaller as it approaches <expression> as <expression> approaches <expression> that this area and this area converge so the area in between kind of has to converge to the both of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we are ready to use the squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the slightly larger area of this wedge is we figured out just now is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is less than the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see that i actually typed it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that we have hopefully a decent understanding of the squeeze theorem well use that to prove that the limit ill do it in yellow the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the limit as this light blue line approaches <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> approaches <expression> <expression> is just <expression> and as you get you know its a continuous function so the limit is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets call this length over here lets call this o for opposite", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats the area of that green triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "get the absolute value of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1114, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 1115, "label": "method", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so to get to this lets invert <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so we have this inequality", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area of the entire circle is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "toa", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tells us what fraction we are of the circle and were going to want to multiply that times the area of the whole circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the absolute value of both sides of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1121, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so we could erase everything that took us so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we are ready to go", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets go back to our sohcahtoa definition of tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since we know that the absolute value of <expression>  <expression> we know that these less than signs dont change right", "entities": []}
{"text": "is <expression> ever negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there are <expression> radians in a total unit circle right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation> so the area of the circle so the area of this wedge right here is just going to be  these <expression> cancel out its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "left hand side  the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1133, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so the distance from here to here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to run out of space so let me draw an <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "what is tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "nope that doesnt erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we just figured out that this height right here that this height is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw <equation> a well it is a radius but im going to go beyond the unit circle", "entities": [{"id": 1140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "and this is the graph of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a circle with a radius of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel <expression> from both sides in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1147, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "and so this is just an intuition of what happens with the squeeze theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know if i say <equation> and i invert both sides of <equation> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1151, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 41}, {"id": 1152, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "well in the first quadrant <expression> is positive and <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its just a radius again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and simplify <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1156, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "but we can figure out the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets divide both sides by the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1159, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 1160, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and if you want to see it graphically ive graphed it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats kind of the fraction that this is of you know if you did it in degrees the <expression> that this is over <expression> times <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say the right hand side  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1166, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 1167, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "so the opposite side this right side is going to be  the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1169, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}, {"id": 1170, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "and you know you could say that thats the same thing as the absolute value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the xaxis would look something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do this triangle right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if this is an angle <expression> in radians whats the length of this line right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always going to be a little bit bigger because it includes this area between that triangle and the arc right", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope you see well thats not a different enough color", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is always going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then let me draw the <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1178, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and then what is the limit as <expression> approaches <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats this length right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully that gave you the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the fourth quadrant <expression> is going to be a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were in the fourth and first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the absolute value signs are kind of redundant", "entities": []}
{"text": "this gives a lot of space", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is less than whats the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know and it has <expression> sides a left middle and right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or im going there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to invert it what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope i havent confused you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is that right there is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as long as were in the first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did i say", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope i didnt confuse you by taking the absolute value", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its the unit circle right", "entities": []}
{"text": "erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <equation> this <expression> is in between the two", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you must be bubbling over with anticipation now because ive said this so many times", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in oh ill do it in red", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should have drawn it a little bigger but i think well be able to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "were dealing with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should draw <equation> like quite big", "entities": [{"id": 1194, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so as <expression> approaches <expression> this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that shouldnt change anything especially if youre in the first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know the limit as this top dark blue line approaches <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get absolute value of <expression> which is less than the absolute value of the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1203, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 1204, "label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "well the <equation> is always  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is true as long as were in the first quadrant right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we take the absolute value of everything it still holds in the fourth quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "nope thats not what i wanted to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this whole triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if thats the unit circle what does it mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <equation> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going on the arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the area of that arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all lets just multiply everything by <expression> and get rid of the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1213, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 1214, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 45}, {"id": 1215, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "so the distance from here to here that distance is also going to be <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have this inequality", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the area of the whole circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you approach from the lefthand side you approach <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1218, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "what do i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in order for this limit to exist in order for this limit i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then you could just simplify it", "entities": [{"id": 1226, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "you know theres a little dirty secret about limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "replace the right side to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1228, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 1229, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "so how can we think about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> was an <expression> it would be a simple problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its approaching from the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully that makes sense to you right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets figure out these two limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre probably going to get like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ive taken <expression> minutes of your time", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel out <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1236, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and why", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just we have an <expression> instead of an <expression> but that doesnt make a difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets confirm that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that almost looks like <expression> but i have these squared terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it looks like this limit doesnt exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is approximate", "entities": []}
{"text": "invert colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully youve found it vaguely useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "this isnt going to change with the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets try to substitute", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets take this case down here when were approaching from the negative side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same thing as <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then slightly smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you were to take this out youd square the numerator square the denominator and youd get this", "entities": [{"id": 1245, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}, {"id": 1246, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 54}, {"id": 1247, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 61}, {"id": 1248, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "well thats the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not a dirty secret but in theory you should never get a limit problem wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how can we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me actually let me see if i can let me get the graphing calculator and confirm", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make a substitution in magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "so set this to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1250, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "and once again if you get this answer and youre not so sure take your calculator out and try calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if <expression> approaches <expression> here thats going to make <expression> approach <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1256, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "let me type it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "we proved that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well actually youre at <expression> the whole time on the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive been asked to do some more limit problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so set the right hand side  <expression> right i just took this out of the denominator and it flips right because its <expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1264, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1265, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "now this looks almost like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont think you can see it yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway lets do another problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "let us say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1267, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so essentially we can say well this is going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "substitue <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1270, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take that youre going to get a number thats awfully close to this number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can take the limit within the base i guess you could say and get here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this has an absolute value so you cant just directly manipulate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the limit as <expression> approaches <expression> from the positive side of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just a constant term so we can take it out of the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to get a single variable here instead of a <expression> times a variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets substitute <expression> to <expression> and do this", "entities": [{"id": 1280, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so we simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so this is is this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "try numbers that are just slightly larger then whatever your limit number is", "entities": []}
{"text": "although it connects them and it makes you think the it somehow approaches here", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the absolute value of <expression> if <expression> is a negative number", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that also means that so divide both sides by <expression> and we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1288, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 39}, {"id": 1289, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be great if we could get it into that form and then wed be done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression> squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could factor <expression> out", "entities": [{"id": 1292, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "now this looks a lot like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this <expression> is this is a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this if we approach <expression> from the left we get some number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is what we have to solve for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so another way to rewrite this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if we know were approaching <expression> from the positive side what do we know about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now this is interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "because how do you deal with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you should be able to solve it analytically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "zoom out", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am approaching a different number when i approach it from the lefthand side", "entities": []}

{"text": "so this the base is the only thing thats going to change as i take as <expression> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i approached this function from the lefthand side or from the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what if were able to get rid of this absolute value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that  the limit as <expression> approaches <expression> from the positive side", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the limit does not exist at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the absolute value of <expression> is the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then just numerically if you have a calculator see what its approaching", "entities": []}
{"text": "and sometimes you dont even need a calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see if we can simplify <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1311, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "even the oh", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you dont know how to solve it analytically just put it really really small numbers here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression>> this one looks a lot like the previous one although we have some exponents here of", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means <expression> lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as you see as you approach from the righthand side you approach <expression> right", "entities": []}

{"text": "now what immediately confuses most people is this absolute value thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could take this <expression> right its in the denominator out", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could probably calculate this in your head with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats just because it picks points and just plots them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we set the right hand side  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1329, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 1330, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 33}]}

{"text": "what can i do", "entities": []}

{"text": "simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "well thats just going to  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if they have the same answer then we have the answer to our original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does it mean to take the slope of a curve now", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw it in a different color", "entities": [{"id": 1369, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so <equation> looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there is no slope for the entire curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we go to a point back here even though this is a really badly drawn graph the slope would be something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "my pen is malfunctioning", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im going to ask you is what is the slope of this curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but how can we figure out what the slope is when <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at this point <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that <expression> is this <expression> coordinate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we just use the standard slope formula like before we would say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "so let me draw that secant line <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1381, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "i think youre going to find that this is when math starts to become a lot more fun than it was just a few topics ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "very straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the slope at a given point would be the same as the slope of a tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next presentation ", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a curve youre probably pretty familiar with it by now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now we can take any continuous curve or most continuous curves and find the slope of that curve at an exact point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well know the exact slope at the instantaneous point along the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example let me pick a green the slope at this point right here would be the same as the slope of this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "really we just want to if we want to find the slope of this tangent line we just have to find the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we could try to do is we could try to find the slope of a secant line", "entities": []}
{"text": "how are we going to figure out what the slope is at any point along the curve <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel out <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1386, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and of course this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "secant line looks something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "another coordinate axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in general if i have a straight line let me see if i can draw a straight line properly if i had a straight line thats my coordinate axes which arent straight this is a straight line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think you know where im going", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it just touches that curve and at that exact point they would have this blue curve <equation> would have the same slope as this green line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would be an approximation for what the slope is at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know it sounds very complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the slope of this secant line", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in this line the slope was the same throughout the whole line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is super useful because for the first time everything weve talked about to this point is the slope of a line", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what we could try to do is figure out what the slope is at a given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how are we going to figure this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me try to redraw the curve <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1394, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "the slope would be a negative slope and here its a positive slope but if we took a point here the slope would be even more positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1396, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1398, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and if you go really far out it gets extremely steep", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we want to get the slope of the tangent line we would just have to find what happens as <expression> gets smaller and smaller and smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then draw the slope <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 1407, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "because this line is tangent to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets get started with our derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you look at this curve doesnt the slope change right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so right now were saying that the slope between these two points it would be the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the tangent slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "for a line there is a slope for the entire line because the slope never changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we set the right side to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 1414, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "well this is an easy limit problem right ", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the last presentation i hopefully gave you a little bit of an intuition of what a derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the slope at that point well we now know the slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this point here is of course <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a point along <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "when at the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im also going to show you how to find the derivatives for a whole set of other functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if i were to draw let me pick a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats why we can get the instantaneous change at that point in the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to find the slope between these <expression> points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well just take the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats pretty neat and ill show you how in future presentations how we can apply this to physics and optimization problems and a whole other set of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont take my word on it on lagrange", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this point right here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this point right here is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 1430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and this  <expression> so ake the derivative of <expression> which is the denoted by <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do a separate module on physics", "entities": []}

{"text": "and i want to know what is the slope of this curve", "entities": []}

{"text": "so if you actually did a traditional rise over run the slope this <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i keep it abstract as <expression> because as you know were going to take the <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "thats the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you didnt need to know calculus to know that", "entities": []}

{"text": "so whats this derivative right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me do that ill do that in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its sometimes its fun to just think about things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an explicit function", "entities": []}

{"text": "its not a trick problem but its actually something that i think i first saw it either when i was practicing for the ap calculus exam or actually saw it on the ap calculus exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could cancel <expression> out", "entities": [{"id": 2042, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "we just rewrite it to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 2044, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}

{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "right it just pops out of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we feel really uncomfortable having this <expression> here if we dont like that what we could do is we can substitute", "entities": []}

{"text": "so example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets rewrite <expression> using this property", "entities": [{"id": 2052, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so let me i could clear this guy out up here clear that out clear all of this stuff out there we go", "entities": []}

{"text": "thats where we started from", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats something interesting for you to think about as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "right if i said define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 2059, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 22}]}

{"text": "well anyway im at my time limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative of the outside ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully this will connect everything together", "entities": []}
{"text": "it probably gave you more intuition of how to actually do the problem but it probably gave you less intuition of how it applies to the chain rule", "entities": []}

{"text": "i mean how do we do that well thats where the chain rule comes in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think sometimes it helps develop the intuition", "entities": []}

{"text": "and so whats our final answer ", "entities": []}
{"text": "then this is the same thing and i just made this stuff you know this could have been any letters", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take the derivative of the outside", "entities": [{"id": 2080, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 2081, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 2082, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 42}]}

{"text": "ill give another example with a concrete <expression> and a concrete <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take the derivative of kind of this composite function its the same thing that  the derivative of the inside function which is <expression> times the derivative of the outside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you saw an integral like this youd probably be daunted and youd be surprised many people well into college calculus courses are still daunted by this problem", "entities": []}

{"text": "and this review of chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 2188, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so ill show you a technique called integration by substitution which is essentially the exact same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "right and the reason why we could just treat the <expression> like its just like kind of a variable instead of a function is because we had its derivative sitting right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we learned in the previous indefinite integral module right and then its <expression> something to the third power and then we know from the chain rule that something is the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2192, "label": "method", "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 151}]}
{"text": "same thing but i like to think of it this way because its not a new notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just rewriting the chain rule but im writing in an integral form that this  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2194, "label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "but all you have to recognize is this is the reverse chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 2195, "label": "method", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "so lets say i have the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "now you say sal this completely confused me because it probably did", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we keep the <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "clearly im making up these problems on the fly", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to take the integral and actually you can see kind of how im thinking about these problems im going to take the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2200, "label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 114}]}
{"text": "so the whole thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral if i have <expression> then that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we see the derivative of the <expression> here right which is <expression> so we can just treat <expression> like a variable and take its integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "we say well we have a function and its derivative so let me let <expression>  the function that we have the derivative of", "entities": [{"id": 2208, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "now this might look a little familiar", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of the outside function is <expression> times it coefficient so its <expression> times the whole thing to <expression> less exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats often written like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens if we want to reverse the chain rule well if we wanted to reverse it were essentially saying that we want to take the integral of something where we have the derivative of kind of the inner function and then we have the derivative of a larger composite function", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the same thing i just took the <expression> out", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we have this kind of more complicated part the <expression> and we have the derivative <expression> because we learned the derivative <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all this is saying that the derivative of this is you take the derivative of the inside function <expression> in this example which is <expression> and you multiply it times the derivative of the outer function or the parent function", "entities": [{"id": 2219, "label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}, {"id": 2220, "label": "method", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 73}, {"id": 2221, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 96}, {"id": 2222, "label": "command", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 164}, {"id": 2223, "label": "method", "start_offset": 178, "end_offset": 188}, {"id": 2224, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 196, "end_offset": 210}]}

{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know if ive already forgotten to do it once but dont forget to do the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and essentially what im going to be doing if i could actually substitute for", "entities": [{"id": 2345, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "why is this the reverse chain rule well this is the same thing as the <expression> whoops this should be <expression> right the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2349, "label": "method", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "let me rewrite that", "entities": [{"id": 2350, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}

{"text": "i know this might seem complicated if you arent too comfortable with this type of notation but done in kind of an example form it makes a lot of sense", "entities": []}

{"text": "well whats the derivative of the <expression> if you remember from the derivative module its <expression> right let me write that down in the corner here", "entities": []}

{"text": "so let me see if i can draw that graphically", "entities": [{"id": 2593, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "thats all the mean value theorem is", "entities": []}

{"text": "and now the mean value theorem tells us that there must be some point thats between these <expression> maybe including <expression> of those where the slope at that point is exactly  <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "looks like the slope there could look something like could be parallel as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully that makes a little sense to you", "entities": []}

{"text": "this is going back to our original intuition of what even a derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so before i leave lets do this analytically just to work with numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say we have the function <equation> and the interval that i care about here is between is a closed interval so im including <expression> from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2608, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "let me make sure of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "position", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is time and i call this position or distance or it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could take the derivative and the derivative is continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "the interval that we care about is from here to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we said the average slope so the closed interval that we care about between <expression> and <expression> its from <expression> here to <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see what value of <expression>  the average slope between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this isnt too hard to draw for myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "where does the slope  <expression> and you get <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets say i had a varying velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at <expression> were at point <expression> so the vertex is at the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so this could be you know i have a variable velocity and this could be my position as a function of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason why i have mixed feelings about the mean value theorem its useful later on probably if you become a math major youll maybe use it to prove some theorems or maybe youll prove it itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of <expression> is <expression> right so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in reality if youre driving a car you are always at a variable velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i accelerate again decelerate accelerate et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point <expression> is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "nope thats not neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i was moving at a constant velocity my position as a function of time would just be a straight line right and the velocity is actually your slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "the average slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at the point <expression> the slope is exactly <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at <equation> the slope  the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me see if i can let me get the graphing calculator here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know sounds complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 2639, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "its just the derivative operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway if youve got to know it youve got to know it and it tells you something else about the world so its interesting that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "these lines should be parallel", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this slope is my average velocity and the way i drew it theres probably <expression> points lets see probably right around here i was probably going <expression> miles per hour the slope is probably <expression> there the instantaneous velocity probably there as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what the mean values theorem says is ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets figure out what point that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets begin with a bit of a review of the actual derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the derivative because the derivative at <expression> is going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2646, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"id": 2647, "label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "the domain of this is actually all real numbers i could put any number here so obviously its going to be defined over this interval", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what can you say you could say that my average velocity  just change in distance divided by change in times", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the interval <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> looks like right around there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can make it a little bit bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill let you think about that for a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in a blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you might want to experiment with it at different points in time because its going to be dependent on where we are and kind of what does the right triangle look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is some function <expression> and im going to put a few conditions on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is my yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i were to draw a line that has that average slope it would look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "that could be <expression> or who knows", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the units", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thatd be the run right and this would be the rise", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway back to the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that in this video", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does the mean value theorem say let me draw some axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the mean value theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what does differentiable mean differentiable means that at every point over the interval that we care about you have to be able to find the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like maybe this point right here just the way i drew it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this calls for magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could make it go through those <expression> points but it really doesnt have to", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the run would be this distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually in this video im going to show you an example of a function that is continuous but not differentiable and because of that the mean value theorem breaks down", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do a visual explanation first", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if the function is continuous continuous continuous and then it jumps that disconnect that would make this function discontinuous or it would not be a continuous function", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is going to the right so its change is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is very inexact", "entities": []}
{"text": "is there any point along this curve where the slope looks very similar to this average slope that we calculated well sure lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means an interval for all the numbers between <expression> and <expression> but not including those", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would go like this and it would start up here go like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what else does that mean well that means that if you were to graph the derivative of this function that it is also continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know a lot of you probably get intimidated when you hear these words", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means you can take the derivative of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the slope the average slope between point a and point b well slope is just rise over run right so what is it let me see if i can draw the average slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its going to be meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have mixed feelings about the mean value theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so back to the mean value theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean really this is kind of just the <expression> and <expression> velocities of those different points", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of neat but what youll see is it might not be obvious to prove but the intuition behind its pretty obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway that is the classic rate of change problem the ladder problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully this video will clarify that little bit and im curious to see what you think of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd write <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2676, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "unless you know youre doing limit problems and they try to make these things break down", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive gotten several requests to explain or teach the mean value theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i shouldnt have written it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here this is the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know you can think about it a little bit that at least at that point in time while the xvalue is increasing at <expression> meters per second the yvalue is moving even faster downward", "entities": []}
{"text": "if that was our yaxis and that was our xaxis just to give you the reference for what i drew", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so this would be an example of a function lets say same axes let me draw it in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the point right here thats the point a f of a", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this function meets all of these requirements", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means it has to be defined at all of the <expression> values from <expression> to <expression> including <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right at least the way i drew it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets ignore that for now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway lets get back to the mean value theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when people talk about a closed interval defined on a closed interval that means that the function needs to be defined at every number between <expression> and <expression> and the function needs to be defined at <expression> and at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> has to be continuous and differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "it sounds like what a mathematician would say and it sounds very abstract", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here the conditions are over a closed interval", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is another very mathy term youll see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does that mean so we can look at it visually", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats as good as any", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write it that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that point looks like the slope you know i could say the slope is something like that right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "most of the functions we deal with satisfy all <expression> of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say i have some function <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2714, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "if that was our <expression> no thats not a good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a function just has to be continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the average slope between a and b well its rise over run", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> i mean you could whatever meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say this is <expression> right here let me <expression> right here", "entities": [{"id": 2719, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "lets say thats be", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw here a function thats not continuous", "entities": [{"id": 2720, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so thats where that negative value comes from because it has a negative velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a function that is not continuous would look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we dont know what analytically this function is but visually you could see that at this point <expression> the derivative so i just picked that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it has to be continuous differentiable and lets say its defined over the closed interval and this is just the notation for it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know hopefully what continuous means", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you might say hey why is there that minus there well it makes sense because while the xvalue its rate of change with respect to time its going in the positive direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youll often say on a closed interval from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it was an open interval you would write it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "all continuous means is that the curve is connected to itself as you go along it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but whats happening to the yvalue the yvalue you could say its velocity is downward", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats something to think about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the run whats this distance well its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw my <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2730, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "it gives a little bit more intuition why this really just is the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do the ladder in a different color still", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the change of <expression> with respect to time is <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the rate of change at which <expression> is changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just doing it right below the line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "times and this is what were solving for", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i just want to give you the intuition that if you were to put a roller here and put a roller there that thats what a ladder would do", "entities": []}
{"text": "right this is <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then we can solve for the rate of change of <expression> with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the derivative of this expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully youre satisfied with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": " and we have to do it to both sides of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "how fast is that moving down right so how do we think about this well lets call this distance right here <expression> because it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "were <expression> meters away so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you get the change in <expression> with respect to time  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right at that point it would either stop but if someones pulling it then it could continue to go at <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the derivative with respect to <expression> of this entire expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "subtract <expression> from both sides we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 2752, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 2753, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "do we know y well i think we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to figure out is the rate of change of this point of the ladder the top point of the ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how much does <expression> move in a very small amount of time and what are we looking for were looking for how fast is this yvalue moving downward", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just substitute the values", "entities": [{"id": 2760, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so this right here describes if youve watched the video on implicit functions or implicit differentiation this is kind of an implicit function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what do we know we know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just draw it really messy real quick on this side", "entities": [{"id": 2764, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so we know <expression> we know the rate of change of <expression> versus time", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would slide down", "entities": []}
{"text": "right or an implicit function of <expression> really", "entities": []}
{"text": "this point right here is moving to the right at <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "right if we take this <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my question to you is what is the rate of change of this point of the kind of top of the ladder what is its rate of change downwards when the left point of the ladder right here is going to the left at <expression> meters per second and this distance right here let me do it in a different color is <expression> meters actually let me do the mirror image of that just because i dont want to use negative numbers and all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually weve actually already drawn that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just realized that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then we can simplify up here", "entities": [{"id": 2774, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so lets take the derivative with respect to time of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2776, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 2777, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "that was given in the problem <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> is <expression> what is <expression> well we could just use this formula right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me erase my woops", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression> but we know that were only dealing with positive values at least in this example right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of the horizontal displacement", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what can we do now well were dealing with rates of change with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the greatest common factor i think its a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the change in <expression> with respect to time at this moment in time its <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me erase some stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rate of <expression> with respect to time well it never changes so its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i tend to try to crowd too much into <expression> window making things confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets call this distance up here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the ground thats the wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why i did that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats essentially what the question is asking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right we know <expression> is what <expression> is at this point in time <expression> meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  <expression> which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so at any given point in time how does <expression> <expression> and <expression> relate well this is a right angle so we can use the pythagorean theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right this point would go down", "entities": []}
{"text": "times the change in so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just figured out that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you found this to be a little confusing you might want to watch the video that we actually just did on implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then how much does <expression> change with respect to time well this <expression> value is never going to change because frankly the length of the ladder is never going to change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <expression>  what its  the hypotenuse squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "how fast is <expression> changing as a function of time when <expression> is changing at a function of time at <expression> meters per second and the value of <equation> meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so were looking for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually im going to do the horizontal component as <expression> and i wanted this to be a positive xvalue instead of a negative xvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "but hopefully you get this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative with respect to time of <expression> well its the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 2820, "label": "method", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "so what is this <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this point would go out to the left until the ladder is in something like this position", "entities": []}
{"text": "until it is flat on the ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression> were saying well what is the rate of change of <expression> with respect to time when <expression> is <expression> so we get <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "times the derivative of <expression> with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats where that <expression> comes from", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i know that seems very complicated but essentially all we do is we take the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think that is good enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the rate of change or this <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when it slides down this point would go to the base of the floor right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that my ladder is <expression> meters long", "entities": [{"id": 2834, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so the bottom of this ladder is moving to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "when this point right here is moving to the left at <expression> meters per second as long as we have some height here you know at some point this whole thing is going to fall down", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats too thin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to know is what is the rate at which the area thats kind of included by this ripple this entire area how fast is that changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have shown that and visually it shows that this is the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is my yellow wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the wall this is the ground thats a ladder leaning against the wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets think about a couple of things whats happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we did that is we said well the point <expression> comma <expression> is on this green line as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we just used our algebra <expression> skills to figure out the equation of that line", "entities": []}
{"text": "all we have to do to figure out the rate at which <expression> is changing with respect to time is we have to figure out the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the ladder for whatever arbitrary reason will just be sliding along the ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will do the ground in brown", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we already know this piece right we already know the rate at which <expression> is changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be an actual circle which isnt what i drew but close enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before the latter completely falls to the ground while this is being pulled out this way this point right here is going to be coming down", "entities": []}
{"text": "right think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its not by chance that thats also for radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can look it up on wikipedia or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were not going to worry all about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is where i dropped the rock and then this is a ripple in the pond", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we just have to solve for the yintercept", "entities": []}
{"text": "were just going to do the classic ladder problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the ripple is spreading out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me say that lets call <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2844, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "well are we done yet well no because we havent substituted yet for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "something even more interesting is to figure out what the antiderivative is of the area and compare that to the volume of a sphere", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just <expression> times the rate at which <expression> is changing with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does a chain rule tell us the chain rule tells us that the rate at which a changes with respect to <expression>  the rate at which a changes with respect to <expression> times the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe someones pulling it or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression> is just right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get <expression>  whats the derivative with respect to <expression> here well thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how did we do that we knew the slope because thats just the derivative at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we figured that out from the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we multiply out the units we would have gotten the same thing right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> meters so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say its moving to the left at <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to give a side view of the ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the ripple is moving out at <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im now going to actually do a couple more rates of change problems because i think the first <expression> i did was probably a little bit more complicated than i wanted and the hard part was actually the geometry and not the calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to figure out the rate at which area changes with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the ground and then i have a yellow wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that for whatever reason ive kind of greased up this wall and the floor here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so going back to our original thing we now know that the rate at which a changes with respect to <expression>  the rate at which a changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well do we know any relation between the area of the circle essentially and the distance of the ripple or the radius well yes we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact thats probably whats causing it to slide to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is that <expression> is <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or even compare that to the surface area of the sphere and just keep picking derivatives and integrals and theyll be some pretty interesting relationships", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we figured out the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rate at which <expression> is changing with respect to <expression> is <expression> meters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "im looking at it from the side", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is mildly fascinating", "entities": []}
{"text": "when the ripple is lets say <expression> meters from the center", "entities": [{"id": 2879, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "r is the distance that the ripple is from the center from where it started from the get go", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and its meters squared per second because its the rate at which area square meters is changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> meters per second we figured that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then leaning against that yellow wall and the ground i have a ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the ripple spreads out itll probably have multiple ripples but lets just say we focus on <expression> ripple", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> something", "entities": []}
{"text": "a thicker ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just right here right the rate at which a changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i figure i would do one because it really is the classic rate of change problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the next video im going to do a slightly harder rate of change problem just so that you see that it doesnt only apply to kind of purely geometric things", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hope you found that vaguely useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next module", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so a normal ladder would just kind of stay where it is but especially because this floor is all greased up the bottom of this ladder is moving to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw", "entities": [{"id": 2885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "lets say this is the ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the ladder rate of change problem so lets say i have the ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats pretty interesting by itself that the rate at which the derivative of the area formula really is what this formula by itself looks interesting right thats a formula for the circumference of a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually itll do it at an accelerating rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative with respect to <expression> do it of both sides of <expression>  the derivative with respect to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when the ripple  <expression> meters", "entities": []}
{"text": "it applies to pretty much anything that you can find a relationship between <expression> values", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of an area of a circle with respect to the radius is a circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw an arrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just say i drop a rock into a pond and it has a ripple", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rate at at which <expression> is changing with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "r is not for ripple", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> well i wont include the units because that might confuse you right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its part of any complete calculus education", "entities": []}
{"text": "where am i going to draw my wall this is the ground", "entities": []}
{"text": "not to go on too far of a tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "back to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the point <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont like these <expression>s there you could replace that with the number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can substitute <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to know equation of the tangent line at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the product rules help us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the slope is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you may want to watch this again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> is just <expression> times the <expression> times <expression> plus the first function <expression> times the derivative of the second function", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the equation of the tangent line it is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets substitute those points back in here or this point back into this equation and then solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2910, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 2911, "label": "command", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "we say <equation> well thats just  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 2914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "<expression> et cetera and this would become <expression> point something and this would just be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this function is going to look something like i actually graphed it because its not a trivial function to graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the equation of the tangent line so lets go ahead and take this form the equations going to be <expression>  im just writing it in the you know not the point slope the <expression> form that you learned in algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets confirm", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of this thing is going to be  the derivative of the first expression of the first function", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets subtract <expression> from both sides", "entities": [{"id": 2921, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 2922, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "<expression> something centimeters per second is the rate at which the height of the water level is going to change as i put <expression> centimeter cubed of volume into this cup per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we said ok the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "we figured out the derivative evaluated <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> <expression> right thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to do is figure out the equation of the line tangent to this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> point this is <expression> right here the point <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>  well this looks like a job for the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were saying at the point at the point <expression> comma <expression> so at the point <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were going to do is were going to solve it by figuring out its slope which is just the derivative at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its worthwhile", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope at any point of this curve  the value of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what we did here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can figure out what this number is its going to be like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it graphed it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just using a graphing calculator and you can see i just typed it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> this is what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative of this so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let us graph this line", "entities": [{"id": 2944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "i dont know if that helps", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the derivative of this function at the point <equation> or at the point <expression> comma <expression> so we just evaluate it", "entities": [{"id": 2948, "label": "command", "start_offset": 126, "end_offset": 134}]}
{"text": "and by definition the tangent line is going to go through that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what point thats this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we know how to figure out the derivative of <expression> we know how to figure out the derivative of <expression> and theyre just multiplying by each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just get an intuition of what were even looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just learned that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i realize ive never actually done that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope at when <equation> and <equation> the slope at that point  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me type it in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the point <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the point <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what this is asking us is ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we can figure out the yintercept of this line we are done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative of <expression> and thats what i find so amazing about the number <expression> or the function <expression> is that the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the equation of the tangent line its slope is going to be the derivative at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we solved the derivative of this function and evaluated it at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this looks neater", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know we could figure out what that number <expression> is just a constant number but we write <expression> because its easier to write <expression> than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the equation of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the derivative when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> whatever there but were not doing that because this is cleaner", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>  <expression> thats just the slope at that point times <expression> times <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the slope of the equation or this is the slope of the curve when <equation> or at the point <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> something", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <equation> <expression> is <expression> right you can just substitute back into the original equation to get that", "entities": [{"id": 2989, "label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "but if you look here so this red this is our original equation <expression> thats this curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do a couple more videos with these rates of change problems because these tend to confuse people but once you get the hang of it i think youll see that theyre not so bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "it might confuse you because <expression> youll say oh <expression> is that a variable no its a number remember its like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we use what we learned from algebra <expression> to figure out its equation and well graph it here just to confirm that we actually figured out the equation of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets use this little graphing calculator to confirm that that really is the equation of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is going to be someplace up here and actually <expression> is going to be  <expression> right because <expression>  what <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that that line that green line i dont know if you can maybe i need to make this bigger for it to show up bolder", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point where were trying to find the tangent line right so this point <expression> comma <expression> this is where we want to find the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to figure out the derivative at exactly this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that well if we knew a <expression> or an <expression> where this equation goes through we could then solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have probably confused you", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> whatever whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know a <expression> and <expression> that satisfies this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing we want to know is the slope of the tangent line and thats just the derivative at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says find the equation of the tangent line to the function <equation> at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <equation> or at the point <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have figured out the equation of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> et cetera and an infinite number of digits so we just write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3017, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so thats this part", "entities": []}
{"text": "assuming that ive lets say <expression> centimeters of water", "entities": [{"id": 3019, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and there you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> times the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats where the water is in this cone", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression> the height i just replaced it for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> centimeter cubed per second squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the volume of water that i put in the cone well if you dont know it and i sometimes well actually later when we do rotations of solid into integration modules i can actually prove this to you but the volume of a <equation> where the base is actually you can kind of view it as the surface area of the water", "entities": []}
{"text": "it might not seem obvious but all were doing is the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the volume assuming that the height is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we solve for <expression> we get let me make sure not to confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre saying sal what have you now done", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just kind of solid geometry review", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want you to think about this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i have a cone", "entities": []}
{"text": "so with that out of the way lets use this to solve something kind of hopefully a little bit neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate at which the height of water is changing with respect to time is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way i taught you whats the change of <expression> with respect to <expression> well thats just <expression> and whats the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression> well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative with respect to time of the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully this make sense to you that these are just <expression> different ways of writing the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 3039, "label": "method", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 109}]}
{"text": "but if we figure it out if we took the rate of change with respect to time off of both sides of this equation something interesting might happen", "entities": [{"id": 3040, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "and whats the radius in this case its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "very interesting now lets start doing some calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that this just give us a static picture of if we know the height we can figure out the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this part is just still see i can rewrite in this new color <expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the base well thats just  <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this actually makes sense just from a fractions point of view that this term and that term cancels out and you get you know that this  that rate at which <expression> changes with respect <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is <expression> the rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to know this is an interesting question how fast is the water level rising", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "fascinating", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i wrote is the traditional but the way ive taught you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats our answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "we said the height is <expression> right then so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the top of the cup", "entities": []}
{"text": "i changed colors really for no reason", "entities": []}
{"text": "how fast is <expression> changing the height of the water at the moment when <equation> centimeters", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just complicated not complicated really just a little bit hairy solid geometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i could just rewrite this in the traditional chain rule format", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you know its a fixed cone these are lines on both sides", "entities": [{"id": 3055, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "so just to start off with some you maybe never even learned this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <expression> centimeters per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> something something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets then just solve that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take the derivative with respect time on both sides", "entities": [{"id": 3058, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 3060, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59}, {"id": 3061, "label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so can this solve the problem for us well what do we know we know the rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the volume of lets say im filling water up to height <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that ratio stays fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will help us with the problem later on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre saying sal this looks completely foreign to me", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets say were pouring <expression> centimeter cubed per second into this cup", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this is where the water line is", "entities": []}
{"text": "just for other frames of reference but i like to stay in centimeters cubed per second because were going to work with centimeters in multiple dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> you know plus some other points then we have the cheapest container to produce", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this example i said that the radius is <expression> of the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just say that <expression> actually is a function of <expression> which as you know it is", "entities": [{"id": 3070, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "ill change colors again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this isnt really the traditional", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression>  the rate at which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to get rid of the units", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say at any point in the clone the ratio of the radius of the cone to the height if this is the height then the radius is <expression> of height", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this cancels out and we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its <expression> of those cups you have at the water cooler", "entities": [{"id": 3077, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so what im going to do is im going actually write this in a way that might be a bit foreign to you but i think with a little bit of explanation youll realize that this is the same thing as the chain rule that we all know and love", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we simplify that we get volume  lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for you metric jocks youll know sometimes doctors or nurses will say <expression> cc and thats also  <expression> millimeter", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to change colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think what was this this is either lagrange or leibnizs notation and this the other guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just dvdt", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i am pouring water into this cup at a rate of <expression> cubic centimeter per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get <equation> and then <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent done any calculus yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said the rate of which the volume is changing with respect to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i forget", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>  the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know what <expression> is right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is just simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <equation> where <expression> is the radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this might blow your mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "most physics instructors would cringe", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one you could think about what i just said and i think itll make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little confusing because i had no <expression>s in this equation before and all of a sudden im picking a derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just start with a review of the chain rule and im going to write in a different way", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you found that vaguely useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i had the function <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3110, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "at any point", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the chain rule up here", "entities": [{"id": 3111, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "sometimes i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the derivative with respect to time of this side of the equation well its the rate which <expression> changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> so we can just write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill tell you a little you know", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you need to review it just rewind the video", "entities": []}
{"text": "we were able to solve that because they gave us constraint on the volume of the box", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they already said that the volume is <expression> meters cubed so that gives us a good constraint", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me start drawing this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "the length of its base is twice its width", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you understand all of this so let me get rid of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive been sent another maximization or minimization problem and this seemed to be an interesting twist on what weve already done so lets do this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats its base", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> times the area of the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "material for the sides costs <expression> per square meter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> <expression> and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know that this is either going to be a maximum or a minimum or at least a local maximum or minimum or if you try another <expression> and if its greater then you have a minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of <expression> and this is a fun nonhairy derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the cost of the material on the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets see what the cost of the material the total cost of the material is going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just for fun lets figure out what that is actually ", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so whats the area of each of these sides its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "or the other thing is well you know if theres only <expression> critical point and they ask you to find the cheapest container that critical point is probably going to be the minimum point", "entities": []}
{"text": "a rectangular storage container with an open top is to have a volume of <expression> meters cubed", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so now we have to figure out this side here and that side over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me clear up some space", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think we should be able to find a constraint on this because we know what the volume has to be right it says materials for the sides of cost <expression> per square meter", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets divide both sides by <expression> and so what do we get", "entities": [{"id": 3134, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 3135, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so we want to set the derivative to find the minimum or maximum point at minimum or maximum point on the curve the slope is <expression> so the derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do a couple things", "entities": []}
{"text": "the length of its base is twice its width", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this base right here the material costs <expression> per square meter", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the cost of materials for the cheapest such container", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then lets see what you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to make this too messy", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so ill do it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can even say as <expression>  what", "entities": [{"id": 3142, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and the first thing i would do is just you could divide both sides by <expression> and you get <equation> divided by <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3147, "label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 55}, {"id": 3148, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "its a rectangular storage container with an open top", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the minimum or maximum point are going to be where this  <expression> so lets set that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the volume of a rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres <expression> of these sides im going to multiply them by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "length times width times height", "entities": []}
{"text": "com and lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets figure that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we want to add the cost of the material on the sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is so we could write this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the base and if i call this the width so this is <expression> the length is twice that this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i dont know lets multiply both sides of this equation by <expression> so you get <equation> or <equation> or <equation> or we could just say <expression> whatever that could be", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets simplify this", "entities": [{"id": 3162, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the cost of putting the fabric or the material on this on this open rectangle is see <expression> whats this <expression> is <expression> plus lets see <expression> <expression> and so we can further simplify that as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "first lets figure out what the height is in terms of <expression> and then we can find an equation for the cost in terms of <expression> and then take the derivatives and find the minimum et cetera et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could just say we want <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3177, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and let me do it in a brown maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> right <expression> is <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have just solved that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see let me do it a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the cost of the base its going to be area of the base times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we take this equation we divide both sides by <expression> we get <equation> which  we could say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3192, "label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 3193, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "if you see this in a class or maybe you want to prove that for yourself on a test but an easy way to test that is just try some other <expression> right we have the cost function right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you add <expression> to both sides you get <equation> or <expression> right thats the same thing is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3199, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"id": 3200, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "actually i like the drawing but its got to go because i need the room", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that has to  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where gets a little bit interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the surface area of the sides oh no they tell the material for the base first", "entities": []}
{"text": "the cost of the material", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the area of the base its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill actually go to google", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill do that in magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the cost and it said it was an open top so theres no theres no fabric we need for the top", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> right base times height times width whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we care about this side up in front and then that side back there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the length of its base is twice the width right so this is the length of the base this is the width", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and do we know that this is a minimum or a maximum point well we could go and take the second derivative and then confirm that were concave upwards at this point and then we would know that we are at a minimum point and this is the cheapest such container", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were ready to just take the derivative and find out what the minimum point is of this curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "length times the width times the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres <expression> sides that are <expression> this side and this side are the same size", "entities": []}
{"text": "try some other <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok material and then the height for now is unknown", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres <expression> sides and then what is it its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now to start out today were going to finish up what we did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "which has to do with partial fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "i told you how to do partial fractions in several special cases and everybody was trying to figure out what the general picture was", "entities": []}
{"text": "but id like to lay that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill still only do it for an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it will be somehow a bigger example so that you can see what the general pattern is", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial fractions remember is a method for breaking up socalled rational functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "which are ratios of polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it shows you that you can always integrate them", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats really the theme here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is whats reassuring is that it always works", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats really the bottom line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats good because there are a lot of integrals that dont have formulas and these do", "entities": []}
{"text": "it always works", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe with lots of help", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe slowly", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres a little bit of bad news and i have to be totally honest and tell you what all the bad news is", "entities": []}
{"text": "along with the good news", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> step which maybe i should be calling step <expression> i had a step <expression> <expression> and <expression> last time is long division", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you do that by long division", "entities": [{"id": 3218, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "and the quotient is easy to take the antiderivative of up because its just a polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that you can do the next step", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the next step which i called step <expression> last time thats great imagination its right after step <expression> step <expression> was to factor the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 3223, "label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 150}, {"id": 3224, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 155, "end_offset": 166}]}
{"text": "and im going to illustrate by example what the setup is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know maybe well do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "some polynomial here maybe cube this <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3226, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "so here ive factored the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what i called step <expression> last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now heres the <expression> piece of bad news", "entities": []}
{"text": "in reality if somebody gave you a multiplied out degree whatever polynomial here you would be very hard pressed to factor it", "entities": []}
{"text": "a lot of them are extremely difficult to factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats something you would have to give to a machine to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its just basically a hard problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so obviously were only going to give you ones that you can do by hand", "entities": []}
{"text": "so very low degree examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just the way it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is really a hard step in disguise in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway were just going to take it as given", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets count up what its degree has to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is degree <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all together its this which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this thing is of degree <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the way up to degree <expression> thats the possibilities for the numerator here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the extra information that i want to impart right now is just this setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "which i called step <expression> last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the setup is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now its going to take us a while to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this factor here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have another factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have another term with the square", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have another term with the cube", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have another term with the <expression> power", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is whats going to happen whenever you have linear factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll have a collection of terms like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have <expression> constants to take care of", "entities": []}
{"text": "now with a quadratic in the denominator you need a linear function in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats if you like <expression> <expression> this quadratic term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i didnt show you last time was how you deal with higher powers of quadratic terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the way you did in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then youre going to have to do the same thing with the next power", "entities": []}
{"text": "now notice just as in the case of this top row i have just a constant here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even though i increased the degree of the denominator im not increasing the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "its staying just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not linear up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its better than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here it stayed a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i stayed a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly here even though im increasing the degree of the denominator im leaving the numerator the form of the numerator alone", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a linear factor and a linear factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the key to this pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have quite as jazzy a song on mine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is so long that it runs off the blackboard here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue it on the next", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve got this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess i have room for it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to talk about this in just a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so heres the pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me just do a count of the number of unknowns we have here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression> is no coincidence", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the degree of the polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the number of unknowns that we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the number of degrees of freedom in a polynomial of degree <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is a very complicated system of equations for unknowns", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the other bad news", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll be able to evaluate this in no time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the only simplification of your previous method", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont have a method for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just showing what the whole method looks like but really youd have to have a machine to implement this once it gets to be any size at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an equation theres this function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these things are known", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you crossmultiply on the other side what you have is well its <expression> if you cancel this denominator with that youre going to get <expression> the term for <expression> etc", "entities": [{"id": 3281, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 31}, {"id": 3282, "label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 102}, {"id": 3283, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 119}, {"id": 3284, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "its a monster equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats a good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you notice i didnt write it down", "entities": []}
{"text": "why didnt i write it down", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its incredibly long", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact you probably so how many pages of writing would this take", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is about a page of writing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just think of your machine how much time you want to spend on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is that you have to be realistic", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre a human being not a machine", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so theres certain things that you can write down and other things you should attempt to write down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so do not do this at home", "entities": []}
{"text": "it gets more and more complicated as time goes on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the pieces still need to be integrated", "entities": []}
{"text": "we simplified this problem but we didnt get rid of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we still have the problem of integrating the pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "now some of the pieces are very easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "this top row here the antiderivatives of these you can just write down", "entities": []}
{"text": "by advanced guessing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is why im mentioning this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this kind of ingredient is something you already covered", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you do this <expression> by advanced guessing although you it as the method of substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "you realize that its going to be of the form <expression> roughly speaking", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were going to fix that", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you differentiate it you get <expression> thats <expression> this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the other piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it always works but maybe slowly", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way theres even another horrible thing that happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is if you handle this guy here whats the technique", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is another technique that you learned supposedly within the last few days", "entities": []}
{"text": "completing the square", "entities": [{"id": 3336, "label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so this it turns out you have to rewrite it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the evaluation is going to be expressed in terms of im going to jump to the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to turn out to be expressed in terms of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what will eventually show up in the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all of these things will be involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the last message that i have for you is just this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this thing is very complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "were certainly never going to ask you to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you should just be aware that this level of complexity we are absolutely stuck with in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason why were stuck with it is that this is what the formulas look like in the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the answers look like this the formulas have to be this complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate this you get some ratio of polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the things that come up when you take antiderivatives of those rational functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were just stuck with these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so dont let it get to you too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its not so bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact there are computer programs that will do this for you anytime you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you just have to be not intimidated by them", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre like other functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats it for the general comments on partial fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to change subjects to our last technique", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this technique is called integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 3338, "label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "please just because its name sort of sounds like partial fractions dont think its the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its totally different", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> is called integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 3340, "label": "method", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "now unlike the previous case where i couldnt actually justify to you that the linear algebra always works", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claimed it worked but i wasnt able to prove it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a complicated theorem which im not able to do in this class", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i can explain to you whats going on with integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the fundamental theorem of calculus if you like coupled with the product formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "sort of unwound and read in reverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres how that works", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take the product of <expression> functions and you differentiate them then we know that the product rule says that this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im just going to rearrange in the following way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "that is this term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this other term <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus the other piece", "entities": [{"id": 3346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "so i just rewrote this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to integrate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral of the lefthand side  the integral of the righthand side", "entities": [{"id": 3347, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 33}, {"id": 3348, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 69}, {"id": 3349, "label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 3350, "label": "method", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "well when i integrate a derivative of i get back the function itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the fundamental theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this it", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry i missed the <expression> which is important", "entities": []}
{"text": "i apologize", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets put that in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the integration by parts formula", "entities": [{"id": 3352, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "im going to write it <expression> more time with the limits stuck in", "entities": [{"id": 3354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "its also written this way when you have a definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the same formula written twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright now im going to show you how it works on a few examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to give you a flavor for how it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "but itll grow as we get more and more experience", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it looks like theres sort of nothing we can do with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we dont know what the solution is", "entities": []}
{"text": "however i claim that if we fit it into this form we can figure out what the integral is relatively easily", "entities": []}
{"text": "by some little magic of cancellation it happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> is a more manageable function than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what were using is that when we differentiate the function its getting nicer", "entities": []}
{"text": "its getting more tractable for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order for this to fit into this pattern however i need a function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what in the world am i going to put here for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is well <expression> is almost the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is that that makes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it makes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that this is <expression> but its also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which was what i had on the lefthand side", "entities": [{"id": 3372, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "so its both <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now all im going to do is read off what the formula says", "entities": []}
{"text": "what it says is this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is this and <expression> is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> <expression> so that again this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "except in the other order <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im integrating and what do i have to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so look up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> with a <expression> sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here is <expression> thats <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that <expression> is easy to integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the integral of <equation> if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the antiderivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so heres our answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "our answer is that this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do <expression> more slightly more complicated examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then really the main thing is to get yourself used to this method", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres no <expression> way of doing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "just practice makes perfect", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so well just do a few more examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and illustrate them", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> example that im going to use is the integral of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is just slightly more recalcitrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely im going to let <expression> be <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 3406, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and again <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that matches up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well just see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not going to win us the whole battle but it will get us started", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "applying the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 3413, "label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and so the formula is that this is <equation> minus the integral of well its <equation> right thats what i have to put over here", "entities": [{"id": 3416, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 51}, {"id": 3417, "label": "method", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "so <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now you notice something interesting happening here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just demarcate this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let you see what it is that im doing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so notice this is the same integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve already solve that part", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now know notice that the <expression> and the <expression> cancel", "entities": [{"id": 3423, "label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "so were back to the previous case", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt win all the way but actually we reduced ourselves to this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "to the integral of <expression> which we already know", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i can copy that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> and then i have to throw in a constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the end of the problem here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this piece i got from example <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this illustrates a principle which is a little bit more complicated than just the <expression> of integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is a little bit simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the example is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that way i can get all the way back down to the final answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same discussion as before <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the setup is similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have here <expression> the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres <expression> times it turns out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "and then theres a <expression> which cancel", "entities": [{"id": 3446, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "so im going to explain this also abstractly a little bit just to show you whats happening here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you use the notation <expression> is the integral of <expression> and were going to forget the constant here", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the relationship that we have here is that <expression> im sorry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the <expression> term over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times the preceding <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3454, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 3455, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "this <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the idea is that eventually we can get down", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we can reduce to the <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the idea of a reduction formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> step would be to evaluate the <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3473, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "which is if you like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats very easy thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats applying this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just put it in a box here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the method of induction", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im applying it for <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i plugged in <equation> here", "entities": [{"id": 3479, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so here i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what i put right here on the righthand side", "entities": [{"id": 3481, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "and thats going to generate for me the formula that i want which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the answer to this problem over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was example <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice i dropped the constants because i can add them in at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill put in parentheses here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what would happen at the end of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just summarizing what i did on that blackboard right up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same thing but in much more compact notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take <expression> thats going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3489, "label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "again this is box for <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i plug it in what im getting here is <equation> twice this stuff here", "entities": [{"id": 3492, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}, {"id": 3493, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "which is right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill leave the <expression> off", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how reduction formulas work in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to give you <expression> more example of a reduction formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess we have to call this example <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets be fancy lets make it the sine", "entities": []}
{"text": "no no no lets be fancier still", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets make it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would also work for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same sort of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i should mention that on your homework you have to do it for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i decided to change my mind on the spur of the moment", "entities": []}
{"text": "in a later homework youll even do this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "you need the practice", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so how am i going to do it this time", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is again a reduction formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its very important to pick which function is the <expression> and which function is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the only decision you have to make if youre going to apply integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 3509, "label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 64}, {"id": 3510, "label": "method", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "how is it simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats making progress for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand this function here is going to be what ill use for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i differentiated that if i did it the other way around and i differentiated that i would just get the same level of complexity", "entities": []}
{"text": "differentiating <expression> just gives you back <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats boring", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt make any progress in this process", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so im going to instead let <expression> and sorry this is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3524, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "make it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at least it isnt any worse when i went backwards like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i have <expression> and <expression> and now i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this again is <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it happens that <equation> so its a little confusing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is the <expression> were calling <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now minus the integral and i have here <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3537, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "and i have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this recurrence is a new recurrence", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me summarize it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its saying that <expression> should be the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again im dropping the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the reduction formula is that <expression>  this expression here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our reduction formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to illustrate this if i take <expression> if you think about it for a <expression> thats just theres nothing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the antiderivative of <expression> thats going to be <expression> that getting started at the real basement here", "entities": []}
{"text": "again as always <expression> is my favorite number", "entities": []}
{"text": "not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i always start with the easiest <expression> if possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a very very fancy way of saying the following fact", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill put it over on this other board", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that the integral of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is this statement true", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did that in my head", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i did was i <expression> wrote down the formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which was <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because theres an <expression> in there which is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i know the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is only by experience", "entities": []}
{"text": "you must get practice doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look in your textbook youll see hints as to what to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other hint that i want to say is that if you find that you have <expression> factor in your expression which when you differentiate it it gets easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when you antidifferentiate the other half it doesnt get any worse then thats when this method has a chance of helping", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there is theres no general thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "the thing is though if you it with <expression> especially on <expression> those are examples where it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "this power of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a mistake here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was thinking in the back of my head of the following formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is another <expression> which weve just done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the types of formulas that you can get out of integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 3577, "label": "method", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "theres also another way of getting these which im not going to say anything about", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is called advance guessing", "entities": []}
{"text": "you guess in advance what the form is you differentiate it and you check", "entities": []}
{"text": "that does work too with many of these cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to give you an illustration", "entities": []}
{"text": "just because you these formulas are somewhat dry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to give you just at least <expression> application", "entities": []}
{"text": "were almost done with the idea of these formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to get back now to being able to handle lots more integrals than we could before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats satisfying is that now we can get numbers out instead of being stuck and hamstrung with only a few techniques", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have all of the techniques of integration that anybody has", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we can do pretty much anything we want thats possible to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres if you like an application that illustrates how integration by parts can be helpful", "entities": [{"id": 3579, "label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "and were going to find the volume of an exponential wine glass here", "entities": []}
{"text": "again dont try this at home but", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be this beautiful guy here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so whats it going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "this graph is going to be <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 3581, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and the top lets say is <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 3585, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so that the horizontal here coming down is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there are <expression> ways to set up this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so there are <expression> methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is also a good review because of course we did this in the last unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> methods are horizontal and vertical slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the <expression> ways we can do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if we do it with so lets start out with the horizontal ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this shape here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the whole thing evaluated at <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3596, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and that is if i plug in <expression> here i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3599, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "except theres a factor of <expression> there sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "missed the <expression> factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i subtract off well at <expression> this is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3605, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so it cancels", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres nothing left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we get to compare that with what happens if we do it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the vertical", "entities": []}
{"text": "so by vertical slicing we get shells", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that starts thats in the <expression> variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what are the shells", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bottom value is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so id like to begin the <expression> lecture by reminding you what we did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was our geometric point of view and we also did a couple of computations", "entities": []}
{"text": "we worked out that the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we also computed the derivative of <expression> to the nth power for <equation> <expression> etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what we did last time and today i want to finish up with other points of view on what a derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is extremely important its almost the most important thing ill be saying in the class", "entities": []}
{"text": "but youll have to think about it again when you start over and start using calculus in the real world", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again were talking about what is a derivative and this is just a continuation of last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as i said last time we talked about geometric interpretations and today what were gonna talk about is rate of change as an interpretation of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember we drew graphs of functions <equation> and we kept track of the change in <expression> and here the change in <expression> lets say", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then from this new point of view a rate of change keeping track of the rate of change of <expression> and the rate of change of <expression> its the relative rate of change were interested in and thats <expression> and that has another interpretation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the average change", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so thats the point of view that id like to discuss now and give you just a couple of examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get to use the example of this very building to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im cheating here but theres a special case thats obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "i didnt throw it in over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at the bottom at that point of impact we have <equation> and so <expression> which is the derivative  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is why the police are there at midnight on halloween to make sure youre all safe and also why when you come you have to be prepared to clean up afterwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "so anyway thats what happens its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "an easy limit is something like the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and with this kind of limit all i have to do to evaluate it is to plug in <equation> because so what i get here is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3663, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "and thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the end of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are the easy limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> kind of limit  well so this isnt the only <expression> kind of limit but i just want to point this out its very important  is that derivatives are are always harder than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cant get away with nothing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the formula for the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "now notice that if you plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 3671, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so it just basically never works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we always are going to need some cancellation to make sense out of the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can display it visually", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does this mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <expression> is bigger than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that <expression> has the minus sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just a little dyslexic and i hope youre not", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i may have gotten that wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "its much more convenient to have this extra bit of description of limits than to just consider limits from both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so i want to give an example of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also an example of how youre going to think about these sorts of problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill take a function which has <expression> different definitions", "entities": []}
{"text": "say its <expression> when <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3691, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "so maybe put commas there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now draw <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3694, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "its gonna be kind of a little small because im gonna try to fit it down in here but maybe ill put the axis down below", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "today i want to get started by correcting a mistake that i made last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this was mistaken terminology", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said that what we were computing when we computed in this candy bar example was energy and not heat", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its both", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact energy heat and work are all the same thing in physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was foolishly considering the much more  what am i trying to say  the intuitive feeling of heat as just being the same as temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in physics usually heat is measured in calories and energy can be in lots of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is lifting some weight some distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these all have conversions between them", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre all the same quantity in different units", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so these are the same quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "different units", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats about as much physics as well do for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "and sorry about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the example that i was starting to discuss last time and that im going to carry out today was this dartboard example", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going over an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im really going to try to make them pretty realistic assumptions", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is suppose you imagine the question is what does this lefthand side mean", "entities": [{"id": 3731, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that the question thats youre asking", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i try to understand what the distribution of dartboard hits is i should imagine my dartboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "and very often therell be a whole bunch of holes in some places", "entities": []}
{"text": "and fewer holes else", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to figure out what the whole distribution of those marks is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so some places will have more hits on them and some places will have fewer hits on them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what i want to measure is on average the number of hits", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats where this constant comes in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what were saying", "entities": []}
{"text": "so having discussed the setup this is a pretty standard setup oh <expression> more question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can answer this with an analogy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact the person hits rather rarely near the center", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not a ridiculous thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "that actually happens a lot", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> more question", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact that requires further justification", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an interesting issue", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its something which really has to be justified", "entities": []}
{"text": "in certain circumstances it is justified", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so anyway heres our part", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be our chunk for now that were going to estimate the importance the relative importance of", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate that you get a <expression> which cancels the minus sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were evaluating it at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so with the minus sign thats going to get reversed", "entities": [{"id": 3749, "label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "so this is what our part gives us", "entities": []}
{"text": "and more technically if you wanted to multiply through by <expression> it would be <expression> times this", "entities": [{"id": 3755, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 46}, {"id": 3756, "label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "ill say that in just a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now i want to work so if you like the part  maybe even ill call it <expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3760, "label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "thats what it really is if i put in this factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now theres no prejudice as to how many attempts we make", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the most important <expression> feature here of these kinds of modeling problems is there is always some kind of idealization", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the next thing that i want to discuss with you is the interpretation of the whole", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is whats the family of all possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this case what im going to claim is that the reasonable way to think of the whole is its that r can range all the way from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you may not like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so infinity is a really useful concept", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course its nonsense in the context of the darts", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you think of the basement wall where the kid might miss a target hed probably hit the wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "so by doing this im idealizing the problem but im actually making the numbers come out much more cleanly", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is just always done in mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what we did when we went from differences to differentials to differentiation and infinitesimals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "because it makes things easier not because it makes things harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets just see what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3777, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "which is that negligibly small number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this number is <expression> and this other number is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just <expression> in the parentheses there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can tell you from these <expression> numbers what the probability is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the probability that we landed on the target in a radius between <expression> and <expression> so thats this annulus here is the ratio of the part to the whole", "entities": []}
{"text": "which in this case just cancels the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3787, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the formula for the probability", "entities": []}
{"text": "its all gone", "entities": []}
{"text": "now again let me just emphasize the way this formula is supposed to work", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is some fraction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you like its a percent", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "this gives you the probability of the ring but this is a very very wide ring", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then going all the way out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this corresponds to everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "this corresponds to a ring", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "where do i want to go from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to make progress here i still have to give you <expression> more piece of information", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is again supposed to be realistic", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is between <expression> oclock and <expression> oclock", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this section is the part the chunk that we want to see about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a and then this distance here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the longest distance here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the longest distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of the probability that were between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the number that were looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we made a very very bold assumption here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we assumed that this human being who is actually standing the floor is about down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe he wasnt that tall", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway so hes really a little bigger than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the part of him that was close to the target covered about this section here between radius <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as youll see actually from the computation because the likelihood drops off pretty quickly whatever of him was standing outside there wouldnt have mattered anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were just worried about the part thats closest to the target here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i made it a clock", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i made it from <expression> oclock to <expression> oclock so its <expression> of the <expression> hours of a clock", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a way of me making a section that you can visibly see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now so heres what were trying to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to figure this out i need <expression> more item", "entities": []}
{"text": "here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe ill leave myself a little bit of room", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to figure out something about what our information gave us", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that the probability sorry this probability was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets remember what this is", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3818, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats whats this probability is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which means that <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what ill use", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to calculate this other probability here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the probability right up there is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats going to be the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what we calculated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to use some of the arithmetic of exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its really <expression> is <expression> the quantity is <expression> and then i bring that exponent out", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus <expression> to the <expression> power thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this comes out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "this part here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is actually why these tails as you go out to infinity dont really matter that much", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a much smaller number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the probability of the whole band is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can answer the question up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is about <expression> or about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i stood there for <expression> attempts then my chances of getting hit were pretty high", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a typical example of a problem in probability", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me just make <expression> more connection with what we did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is connected to weighted averages or integrals over weights", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the weight thats involved in this problem was <expression>  so lets just look at what happened in all of those integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happened in all the integrals was we had this factor here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i include this <expression> it was really <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was the weight that we were using", "entities": []}
{"text": "the relative importance of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is not the same as the <expression> that we started out with", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is the <expression>dimensional histogram", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that also connects with the question at the beginning which had to do with this paradox that it looks like these places in the middle are the most likely", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the plot <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3850, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "if you actually look at this plot here you see that as <expression> goes to <expression> its going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a different graph here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually so this is whats happening really", "entities": []}
{"text": "in terms of how likely it is that youll get within a certain distance of the center of the target", "entities": []}
{"text": "again its not the area under that curve that were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its that volume of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to change subjects now", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok <expression> more question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a question of which variable youre using", "entities": []}
{"text": "according to pure radius its not", "entities": []}
{"text": "it turns out that there are some bands in radius which are more important more likely for hits than others", "entities": []}
{"text": "it really has to do with the fact that the center or the core of the target is really tiny", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its harder to hit", "entities": []}
{"text": "whereas a whole band around the outside has a lot more area", "entities": []}
{"text": "many many ways to hit that band", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a much larger area", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a competition there between those <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to move on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to talk now about a different kind of weighted average", "entities": []}
{"text": "these weighted averages are going to be much simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they come up in whats called numerical integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are many many methods of integrating numerically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre important because many many integrals dont have formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you have to compute them with a calculator or a machine", "entities": []}
{"text": "they turned out to be incredibly inefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre lousy", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next rule that im going to describe is a little improvement", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called the trapezoidal rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "unfortunately its actually also pretty lousy", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres another rule which is just a slightly trickier rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its actually amazing that it exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its called simpsons rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> is actually pretty good", "entities": []}
{"text": "its clever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get started with these", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way ill get started is by reminding you what the riemann sum is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a good review because you need to know all <expression> of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre going to want to see them all laid out in parallel", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have our graph we have our function it starts out at <expression> it ends up at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe goes on but were only paying attention to this interval", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we split it up when we do riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> this is riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "we go all the way over to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which are the step sizes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have these little steps of size <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> thats the point above <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 3873, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "in order to figure out the area you really need to know something about the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "you need to be able to evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what weve done", "entities": []}
{"text": "enumerated <expression> through <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and those are the numbers out of which were going to get all of our approximations to the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so somehow we want average these numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our goal", "entities": []}
{"text": "our goal is to average or add im using average very loosely here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i was going to say add up these numbers to get an approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "to average or add the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to get an approximation to the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "which we know is the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres what the riemann sum is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the following thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3881, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and you multiply by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3884, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this <expression> is the <expression> with left endpoints", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the lefthand sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres also a right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is if you start at the righthand ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "although if theyre curved they miss by a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is called the trapezoidal rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a trapezoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this being a trapezoid i can figure out its area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you think about if you work out what happens when you do something with a straight line on top like that youll get this average", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the average height of the trapezoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to add up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> times the <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3904, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the <expression> trapezoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this keeps on going", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at the end i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then last of all i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a very long formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to simplify it quite a bit in just a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats this ", "entities": []}
{"text": "well notice that i get <expression> to start out with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now <expression> got mentioned twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "each time with a factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get a whole <expression> in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same thing is going to be true of all the middle terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then the last <expression> is unmatched", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is whats known as the trapezoidal rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "now id like to compare it for you to the riemann sums which are sitting just to the left here", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the left <expression> and heres the right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you actually do it in practice its not very efficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "although its way better than a riemann sum its still not good enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i need to describe to you the fancier rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now it always needs n to be even", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres delta <expression> and heres delta <expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to study the area of this piece here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me focus just on that part", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets reproduce it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course there are various heights", "entities": []}
{"text": "they dont switch", "entities": []}
{"text": "they dont have inflection points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a lousy at this scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "but when we get to a smaller scale this becomes really fantastic", "entities": []}
{"text": "as an approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i need to tell you what the arithmetic is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to save time its on your problem set what the actual formula is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to tell you how to think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want you to think about it as follows", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area under the parabola is going to be a base times some kind of average height", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the base here you can already see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> delta <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the base is <expression> delta <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the average height is weird", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it turns out to be the following formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has to be an average but its an interesting weighted average", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was the punchline if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that they are such things as interesting weighted averages", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its still interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "it turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its supposed to be an average", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it emphasizes the middle more than the sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a computation which is on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can put this together for the full simpsons rule formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "which ill put up over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have here <expression> and we divide by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3960, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "and then we have <expression> plus thats the <expression> chunk", "entities": [{"id": 3963, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "now the <expression> chunk maybe ill just put it in here starts this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it goes all the way to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next <expression> involves the indices <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh oh oh oh no", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think ill get rid of these <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have too many <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets get rid of them here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take them out", "entities": []}
{"text": "put them out here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the way to the end which is <expression> sorry plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 3980, "label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "so here are all the chunks", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does this pattern come out to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "this comes out to be the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then here i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "it keeps on going and keeps on going and keeps on going", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the end its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this weird weighted average is way better", "entities": []}
{"text": "as i will show you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just trying to show you as many examples as possible of solving exact differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> trying to figure out whether the equations are exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if you know theyre exact how do you figure out the <expression> and figure out the solution of the differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just the way it was written this isnt superficially in that form that we want right", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the form that we want", "entities": []}
{"text": "were close", "entities": []}
{"text": "how could we get this equation into this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just divide both sides of this equation by <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 4009, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 4010, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "and then we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have written this in the form that we need in this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we need to prove to ourselves that this is an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the partial of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> function right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was a plus here", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be <expression> and then just a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of this with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be <expression> this would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are dealing with an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we have to find <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the antiderivative with respect to <expression> on both sides and you get <expression>  <expression> to the <expression> <expression> because <expression> is just a constant plus <expression> plus some function of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4057, "label": "command", "start_offset": 179, "end_offset": 183}, {"id": 4058, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 4059, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we know <expression> is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you take a derivative when you take a partial with respect to just <expression> a pure function of just <expression> would get lost", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its like the constant when we <expression> learned taking antiderivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now to figure out <expression> we just have to solve for <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets take the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4072, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 4073, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "thats going to be  this right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> this is <expression> this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> this is <expression> is going to be able to what", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be  our <expression> of <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be able to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we can solve for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can add <expression> to both sides to get rid of this and this", "entities": [{"id": 4085, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 4086, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and then were left with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "antiderivative so <expression>  what is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could put <expression> there but the plus <expression> merges later on when we solve the differential equation so you dont have to worry about it too much", "entities": [{"id": 4094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "so what is our function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill write it in a new color", "entities": []}
{"text": "our function <expression> as a function of <expression> and <equation> to the <expression> minus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4101, "label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "plus <expression> which we just solved for", "entities": [{"id": 4103, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression> to the <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theyre could be <expression> there but youll see that it doesnt matter much", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually i want to do something a little bit different", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not just going to chug through the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to kind of go back to the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i dont want this to be completely mechanical", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just show you what the derivative using what we knew before you even learned anything about the partial derivative chain rule what is the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we just use our implicit differentiation skills", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just <expression> prime right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> times the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> which is just <expression> prime", "entities": [{"id": 4128, "label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the derivative of this with respect to <expression> is easy <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "plus the derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4133, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "well lets take the derivative of this with respect to <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4136, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 4137, "label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "were just doing implicit differentiation of the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 4138, "label": "method", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "so this is plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4140, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and then were using the chain rule so we took the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4142, "label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and then you have to multiply that times the derivative of <expression> with respect <expression> which is just <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "plus the derivative of this with respect to why is <expression> times were just doing the chain rule the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4150, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "so thats <expression> prime", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to see if we can simplify this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this term this term and this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus lets just put the <expression> outside <expression> times lets see you have a negative sign out here <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 4158, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "so this is the derivative of our <expression> as we solved it", "entities": []}
{"text": "look at this closely and notice that that is the same hopefully its the same as our original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "what was our original problem that we started working with", "entities": []}
{"text": "the original problem was <expression> plus <expression> times <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4164, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 4165, "label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "so this was our original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> just using implicit differentiation is exactly this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully this gives you a little intuition of why we can just rewrite this equation as the derivative with respect <expression> of <expression> which is a function of <expression> and <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4173, "label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "because this is the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wrote out here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same thing this right here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we take the antiderivative of both sides we know that the solution of this differential equation is that <expression> of <expression> and <equation> as the solution", "entities": [{"id": 4180, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 4181, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 32}, {"id": 4182, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "and we know what <expression> is so we just set that  <expression> and we have the implicit we have a solution to the differential equation ill just define implicitly", "entities": [{"id": 4186, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "so the solution you dont have to do this every time", "entities": []}
{"text": "this step right here you wouldnt have to do if youre taking a test unless the teacher explicitly asked for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just wanted kind of make sure that you know what youre doing that youre not just doing things completely mechanically", "entities": []}
{"text": "that you really see that the derivative of <expression> really does give you we solved for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then thats how we know that that the derivative of <expression> with respect <equation> because our original differential equation was  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take the antiderivative of both sides of this you get <expression>  <expression> is the solution of the differential equation", "entities": [{"id": 4196, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 4197, "label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 4198, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "or if you wanted to write it out <expression> is this thing", "entities": [{"id": 4200, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "our solution to the differential equation is <expression> to the <expression> minus <expression> plus <expression> plus <expression> to the <expression> plus <expression>  <expression> is the implicitly defined solution of our original differential equation", "entities": [{"id": 4209, "label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 101}, {"id": 4210, "label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 83}, {"id": 4211, "label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 119}, {"id": 4212, "label": "command", "start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 157}]}
{"text": "anyway ive run out of time again", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going on to the <expression> unit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were getting started with unit <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is our intro to integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "its basically the <expression> half of calculus after differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "today what ill talk about is what are known as definite integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually it looks like are we missing a bunch of overhead lights", "entities": []}
{"text": "is there a reason for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "hmm", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "aah", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats a little brighter now", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the idea of definite integrals can be presented in a number of ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i will be consistent with the rest of the presentation in the course", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to start with the geometric point of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the geometric point of view is the problem we want to solve is to find the area under a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so keep that in mind that theres a lot going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are many different interpretations of what the integral is", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so lets draw a picture here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have some curve here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i have in mind is to find this area here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course in order to do that i need more information than just where we start and where we end", "entities": []}
{"text": "i also need the bottom and the top", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have a notation for this which is the notation using calculus for this as opposed to some geometric notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the following expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called an integral but now its going to have what are known as limits on it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we write in the function <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4224, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so this is whats known as a definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its interpreted geometrically as the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in order to understand what to do with this guy im going to just describe very abstractly what we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to compute this area were going to follow initially <expression> steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of all were going to divide into rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing were going to do is to add up the areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing were going to do is to rectify this problem that we didnt actually hit the answer on the nose", "entities": []}
{"text": "that we were missing some pieces or were choosing some extra bits", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way well rectify that is by taking the limit as the rectangles get thin", "entities": []}
{"text": "infinitesimally thin very thin", "entities": []}
{"text": "pictorially again that looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to chop it up", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> im going to chop up the <expression> axis into little increments", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to chop things up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill decide on some rectangle maybe some staircase pattern here", "entities": []}
{"text": "like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i dont care so much", "entities": []}
{"text": "in some cases the rectangles overshoot in some cases theyre underneath", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the new area that im adding up is off", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not quite the same as the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this region here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it includes these extra bits here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its missing this little guy here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this little bit there is missing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as i say these little pieces up here this a little bit up here is extra", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why were not really dividing up the region into rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "were just taking rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre going to be negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "already you can see its kind of a thin piece of area so were not missing by much", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as these get thinner and thinner the problem goes away and we get the answer on the nose in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to do anything more complicated than <expression> example because this is a real labor here what were going to go through", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to make things easier for myself im going to start at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets draw the graph and start breaking things up", "entities": [{"id": 4240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so heres the parabola and theres this piece that we want which is going to stop at this place <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means well graphically ill just mark the <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe there are going to be many of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is ill make us this staircase pattern here like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my choice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im overshooting with each rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have to write down formulas for what these areas are", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres <expression> big advantage that rectangles have", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the starting place", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that its easy to find their areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the reason why we can get started with rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this case these distances im assuming that theyre all  equally spaced intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill always be doing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the spacing the bases the base length is always <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all  intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the base length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and next i need the heights", "entities": []}
{"text": "well my next job is to add up these areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ive already prepared that by finding out what the base and the height is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im sorry is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it just keeps on going", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the last <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its very important to figure out what the general formula is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here we have a base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok this is a very complicated gadget", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing i want to do is simplify it and then im actually going to evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but actually im not going to evaluate it exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to evaluate the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "turns out limits are always easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point about calculus here is that these rectangles are hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the limiting value is an easy value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were heading for is the simple formula as opposed to the complicated <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so the <expression> thing im going to do is factor out all these <expression> factors", "entities": [{"id": 4289, "label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "as a common factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is everybody with me here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that im going to write <expression> just to see that theres a general pattern here", "entities": [{"id": 4305, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "going to write <expression> as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4308, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and lets put in the <expression> here why not", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to use a trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "this trick is not completely recommended but i will say a lot more about that when we get through to the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to understand how big this quantity is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to use a geometric trick to draw a picture of this quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely im going to build a pyramid", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is if you like the top view", "entities": []}
{"text": "but perhaps we should also think in terms of a side view", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the same picture were starting at n and we build up this layer here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were going to put a layer on top of it which is a little shorter", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to pile them up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we pile them up", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the way to the top which is just <expression> giant block of stone", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going backwards in the sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i have to build this whole thing up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get all the way up in this staircase pattern to this top block up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the trick that you can use to estimate the size of this and its sufficient in the limit as n goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im ready to take the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look at what our goal is we want to have an expression like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to this was the massive expression that we had", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually im going to write it differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4346, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <expression> divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4349, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 4350, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "alright so the right thing to do is to divide what i had up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "divide by <expression> in this set of inequalities there", "entities": [{"id": 4352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "and what i get here is <expression> is less than <expression> plus", "entities": [{"id": 4355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "and thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i claim were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this also goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the result from this whole computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is why did we leave the <expression> out for this step", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a part of the answer is malice aforethought", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words we know what were heading for", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know we understand this quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "its all <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "this thing is a sum which is growing larger and larger", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not whats called a closed form", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the thing thats not known or not well understood is how big is this quantity here", "entities": []}
{"text": "whereas this is something thats quite easy to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we factor it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we analyze carefully the piece which we dont know yet how big it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we discovered that its very very similar to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its more similar to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its almost identical to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this extra piece here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we match that", "entities": []}
{"text": "since this thing is very similar to <expression> we cancel the <expression> and we have our result", "entities": [{"id": 4379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "let me just mention that although this may seem odd in fact this is what you always do if you analyze these kinds of sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "you always factor out whatever you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you still are faced with a sum like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this will happen systematically every time youre faced with such a sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now i want to say <expression> more word about notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that this notation is an extreme nuisance here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its really sort of too large for us to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so mathematicians have a shorthand for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "unfortunately when you actually do a computation youre going to end up with this collection of stuff anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want to just show you this summation notation in order to compress it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea of summation notation is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing tends the ideas are the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a capital sigma", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this quantity here for instance is <expression> times the sum <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4389, "label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 60}, {"id": 4390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "so thats what this thing ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the way the summation notation is used", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a formula for each of these coefficients each of these entries here or summands", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this is just an abbreviation for what the sum is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the reason why i stuck in that <expression> at the beginning so that you could see that the pattern worked all the way down to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it isnt an exception to the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same as all of the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "now over here in this board we also had <expression> of these extremely long sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> can be written in the following way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i hope you agree this is rather hard to scan", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a way of abbreviating this massive formula into <expression> which is just a lot shorter", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the manipulation that i performed with it which is to factor out this <expression> is something that im perfectly well allowed to do also over here", "entities": [{"id": 4404, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "this is the distributive law", "entities": []}
{"text": "this if i factor out <expression> im left with the sum <equation> to <expression> of <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 4409, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so these notations make it a little bit more compact", "entities": []}
{"text": "what were dealing with", "entities": []}
{"text": "the conceptual phenomenon is still the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the mess is really still just hiding under the rug", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the notation is at least fits with fewer symbols anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive given you <expression> calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to fit it into a pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the thing that id like to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do <expression> more examples but theyre going to be much much easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then things are going to get much easier from now on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> example is going to be the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i draw that thats this function here thats the line with slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this area here is the same as the area of the triangle with <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <equation> so this is the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "we also know how to find the area of triangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the formula is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> example notice by the way i didnt have to do this elaborate summing to do that because we happen to know this area", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> example is going to be even easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "by far the most important example", "entities": []}
{"text": "remarkably when you get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> multivariable calculus you will forget this calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "somehow", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know why but it happens to everybody", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the function is just horizontal like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we stop it at <expression> then the area were interested in is just this from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know that this is height <expression> so this is area is base which is <expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets look now at the pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to look at the pattern of the function and its the area under the curve which is this has this elaborate formula in terms of so this is just the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have <expression> which turned out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4439, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "and we have <expression> which turned out to be well let me write them over just a bit more to give myself some room", "entities": [{"id": 4441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "<expression> which turns out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4445, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and then we have <expression> which turned out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4450, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "so this i claim is suggestive", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you can figure out the pattern <expression> way of making it a little clearer is to see that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the case <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you want to guess what happens when <expression> is <expression> well if its <expression> you do <expression> if its <expression> you do <expression> if its <expression> you do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its reasonable to guess that this should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a reasonable guess i would say", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the strange thing is that in history archimedes figured out the area under a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was a long time ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was after the pyramids", "entities": []}
{"text": "and he used actually a much more complicated method than i just described here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and his method which is just fantastically amazing was so brilliant that it may have set back mathematics by <expression> years", "entities": []}
{"text": "because people were so it was so difficult that people couldnt see this pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "and couldnt see that actually these kinds of calculations are easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they couldnt get to the cubic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even when they got to the cubic they were struggling with everything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it wasnt until calculus fit everything together that people were able to make serious progress on calculating these areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "even though he was the expert on calculating areas and volumes for his time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is really a great thing that we now can have easy methods of doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the main thing that i want to tell you is thats we will not have to labor to build pyramids to calculate all of these quantities", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will have a way faster way of doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the slow laborious way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will be able to do it so easily that it will happen as fast as you differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats coming up tomorrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want you to know that its going to be however were going to go through just a little pain before we do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill just tell you <expression> more piece of notation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need to have a little practice just to recognize how much savings were going to make", "entities": []}
{"text": "but never again will you have to face elaborate geometric arguments like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just add a little bit of notation for definite integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this goes under the name of riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the general procedure for definite integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "we divide it up into pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so heres our <expression> and heres our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what were going to do is break it up into little pieces", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to give a name to the increment", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we divide up into these", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how many pieces are there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it has to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will for these riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now theres only <expression> bit of flexibility that we will allow ourselves", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what that means is let me just show it to you on the picture here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i go up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have the level which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the rectangle that i choose", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i couldve chosen some level in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "which would have meant that the staircase wouldve been quite a bit lower", "entities": []}
{"text": "so any of these staircases will work perfectly well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were just going to add them all up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the sum of the areas of the rectangles because this is the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "this notation is supposed to be now very suggestive of the notation that leibniz used", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that in the limit this becomes an integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that the <expression> gets replaced by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4491, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "so this is what happens in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "as the rectangles get thin", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats as delta <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these gadgets are called riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is called a riemann sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we already worked out an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "this very complicated guy was an example of a riemann sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well give you a chance to get used to it a little more when we do some numerical work at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last thing for today is i promised you an example which was not an area example", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to be able to show you that integrals can be interpreted as cumulative sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "integrals as cumulative sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so heres the way it goes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to consider a function <expression> were going to consider a variable <expression> which is time", "entities": []}
{"text": "in years", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well consider a function <expression> which is in dollars per year", "entities": []}
{"text": "right this is a financial example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is going to be a borrowing rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "it allows us to change variables it allows this to be consistent with units", "entities": []}
{"text": "and allows us to develop meaningful formulas which are consistent across the board", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i want to emphasize the units in this when i set up this modeling problem here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now youre borrowing money lets say every day", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats almost <expression> from the point of view of various purposes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how much youre borrowing", "entities": []}
{"text": "in each time increment youre borrowing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that you borrow your rate varies over the year", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean sometimes you need more money sometimes you need less", "entities": []}
{"text": "certainly any business would be that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so here you are youve got your money", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre borrowing but the rate is varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so how much did you borrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "here was your borrowing rate times this quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dollars per year", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is if you like i want to emphasize the scaling that comes about here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have dollars per year", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is this number of years", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that comes out to be in dollars", "entities": []}
{"text": "this final amount", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the amount that you actually borrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you borrow this amount", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i want to add up how much you get youve borrowed in the entire year", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "which ill just leave as delta t here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is total amount borrowed", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is kind of a messy sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact your bank probably will keep track of it and they know how to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how much you spend and how much you invest", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the scale of <expression> its probably <expression> its probably enough for many purposes", "entities": []}
{"text": "now however theres another thing that you would want to model", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is equally important", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is how much you borrowed but theres also how much you owe the back at the end of the year", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the amount that you owe the bank at the end of the year im going to do it in a fancy way", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the interest well say is compounded continuously", "entities": []}
{"text": "say", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> per year", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if you want to understand how much money you actually owe at the end of the year", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the end of the year what you owe is well you borrowed these amounts here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now you owe more at the end of the year", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is what you have to add up to see how much you owe", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is essentially the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so when you start computing and thinking about whats the right strategy youre faced with integrals of this type", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and see you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember to think about questions that youll ask next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "in todays lecture i want to develop several more formulas that will allow us to reach our goal of differentiating everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are derivative formulas and they come in <expression> flavors", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> kind is specific so some specific function were giving the derivative of", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that would be for example <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the ones that we did a couple of lectures ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there are general formulas and the general ones dont actually give you a formula for a specific function but tell you something like if you take <expression> functions and add them together their derivative is the sum of the derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so these kinds of formulas are very useful both the specific and the general kind", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example we need both kinds for polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "and more generally pretty much any set of formulas that we give you will give you a few functions to start out with and then youll be able to generate lots more by these general formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so today we wanna concentrate on the trig functions and so well start out with some specific formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre going to be the formulas for the derivative of the sine function and the cosine function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what well spend the <expression> part of the lecture on and at the same time i hope to get you very used to dealing with trig functions although thats something that you should think of as a gradual process", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so in order to calculate these im gonna start over here and just start the calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets check what happens with the <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i take <expression> i subtract <expression> and i divide by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4539, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 33}, {"id": 4540, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 62}, {"id": 4541, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "right so this is the difference quotient and eventually im gonna have to take the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres really only <expression> thing we can do with this to simplify or change it and that is to use the sum formula for the sine function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> oh thats not what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok good", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4548, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so which is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright lets take a vote", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it <expression> <expression> or is it <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right you better remember these formulas alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok turns out that its <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go no gotta do <expression> here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so now theres lots of places to get confused here and youre gonna need to make sure you get it right", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so were gonna put those in parentheses here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats just the <expression> part", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just this part of the expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "i still have to remember the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that comes at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to remember the denominator which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so now", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next thing were gonna do is were gonna try to group the terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the difficulty with all such arguments is the following <expression> any tricky limit is basically <expression> when you set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 4572, "label": "command", "start_offset": 125, "end_offset": 128}]}
{"text": "if i set <equation> this is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4575, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so its a <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we have various things which are <expression> and various things which are non<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we must group the terms so that a <expression> stays over a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "otherwise were gonna have no hope", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we get some <expression> term well get something meaningless in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that the right thing to do here is to notice and ill just point out this <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> goes to <expression> this <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to use this common factor and combine those terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is really the only thing youre gonna have to check in this particular calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now does anyone remember from last time what this thing goes to", "entities": []}
{"text": "how many people say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how many people say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my favorite number alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the easiest number to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this goes to <expression> and thats what happens as <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> goes to <expression> my <expression> favorite number almost as easy to deal with as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these things are picked for a reason", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the simplest numbers to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so altogether this thing as <expression> goes to <expression> goes to what", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want a single person to answer a brave volunteer", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright back there", "entities": []}
{"text": "it cancels and this factor has a <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now i still wanna label these very important limit facts here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> well call <expression> and this <expression> were going to call <expression> because we havent checked them yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "i promised you i would do that and ill have to do that this time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were relying on those things being true", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im gonna do the same thing with the cosine function except in order to do it im gonna have to remember the sum rule for cosine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were gonna do almost the same calculation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna see that that will work out but now you have to remember that <equation> no its not <expression> because there are <expression> different quantities here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so youll have to be willing to call those forth at will right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do the <expression> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok theres the difference quotient for the <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im gonna do the same thing i did before except im going to apply the <expression> rule that is the sum rule for <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4622, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 72}, {"id": 4623, "label": "method", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 115}]}
{"text": "and thats gonna give me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to remember again to subtract the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4626, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "and now im going to regroup just the way i did before and i get the common factor of <expression> multiplying <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4629, "label": "command", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 109}]}
{"text": "and here i get the <expression> but actually its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only difference is this minus sign which i stuck inside there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats not the only difference but its a crucial difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok again by <expression> we get that this is <expression> as <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the properties i called <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the result here as <expression> tends to <expression> is that we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this guy is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill put a little box around that too", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright now these formulas take a little bit of getting used to but before i do that im gonna explain to you the proofs of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well get ourselves started by mentioning that", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe before i do that though i want to show you how <expression> and <expression> fit into the proofs of these theorems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just make some remarks here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just a remark but its meant to help you to frame how these proofs worked", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take the rate of change of <expression> so in other words this derivative at <equation> then by definition this is a certain limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so which <expression> is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have to subtract <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4658, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "thats the base point but thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to divide by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4661, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and lo and behold you can see that this is exactly the limit that we had over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> that we know is <expression> by what we call property <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly if i take the derivative of <equation> then thats going to be the limit as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be <expression> by our property <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4671, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so thats really what this argument is showing us is that we just need <expression> rate of change at <expression> place and then we work out all the rest of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats really the substance of this proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "that of course really then shows that it boils down to showing what this rate of change is in these <expression> cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now theres enough suspense that we want to make sure that we know that those answers are correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets demonstrate both of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill start with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to figure out property <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we only have <expression> alternative as to a type of proof that we can give of this kind of result and thats because we only have <expression> way of describing sine and cosine functions that is geometrically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to give a geometric proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to write down a geometric proof we are going to have to draw a picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets draw a picture of what it is that were going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here is the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres some little angle well ill draw it a little larger so its visible", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres theta alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wont write that down on here but thats the unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now sin theta is this vertical distance here", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill draw it in a different color so that we can see it all", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so heres this distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "this distance is sin theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "that little piece in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe ill use a different color for that to indicate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats orange and thats this little chunk there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in order to persuade you now that the limit is what its supposed to be im going to extend the picture just a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so that youll remember this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to take a theta angle below and ill have another copy of <expression> down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the total picture is really like a bow and its bow string there", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we have here is a length of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe ill write it this way <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4690, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "i just doubled it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i have underneath whoops i got it backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "trying to be fancy with the colored chalk and i have it reversed here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the vertical", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the green", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try that again", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you like this is the bow and up here we have the bow string", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course we can cancel the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4697, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now why does this tend to <expression> as theta goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its because as the angle theta gets very small this curved piece looks more and more like a straight <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you get very very close here the green segment and the orange segment would just merge", "entities": []}
{"text": "they would be practically on top of each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they have closer and closer and closer to the same length", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess ill articulate that by saying that short curves are nearly straight", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so thats the principle that were using", "entities": []}
{"text": "or short pieces of curves if you like are nearly straight", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you like this is the principle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so short pieces of curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i also need to give you a proof of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the property <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i want to interpret it as a length im gonna want a positive quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna write down <expression> here and then im gonna divide by <expression> there", "entities": [{"id": 4706, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 4707, "label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "again im gonna make some kind of interpretation", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this time im going to draw the same sort of bow and arrow arrangement but maybe ill exaggerate it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the vertex of the sector but well maybe make it a little longer", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so here it is and here was that middle line which was the unit whoops", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok i think im going to have to tilt it up", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets try from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright well you know on your pencil and paper it will look better than it does on my blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so here we are", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres this shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this angle is supposed to be theta and this angle is another theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same as in the other picture except weve exaggerated a bit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have this vertical line which again im gonna draw in green the bow string", "entities": []}
{"text": "but notice that as the vertex gets farther and farther away the curved line gets closer and closer to being a vertical line", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats sort of the flip side by expansion of the zoom in principle", "entities": []}
{"text": "the principle that curves are nearly straight when you zoom in", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you zoom out that would mean sending this vertex way way out somewhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "the curved line the piece of the circle gets more and more straight", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now let me show you where this numerator <expression> is on this picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this whole distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the distance from the vertex to the green is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this little tiny bitty segment here is basically the gap between the curve and the vertical segment", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gap  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now you can see that as this point gets farther away if this got sent off to the stata center you would hardly be able to tell the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bow string would coincide with the bow and this little gap between the bow string and the bow would be tending to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the statement that this tends to <expression> as <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the scaled version of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "in my strange analogy with zooming in what i did was i zoomed out the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words if you imagine youre taking this and youre putting it under a microscope over here and youre looking at something where theta is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now because i want my picture i expanded my picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the ratio is the thing thats preserved", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i make it so that this gap is tiny", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me say this <expression> more time", "entities": []}
{"text": "im afraid ive made life complicated for myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want to keep on blowing up the picture so that i can see the difference between the vertical and the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats very much like if you are on a video screen and you zoom in zoom in zoom in and zoom in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is what would that look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "that has the same effect as sending this point out farther and farther in that direction to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so im just trying to visualize it for you by leaving the <expression> at this scale but actually the scale of the picture is then changing when i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theta is going to <expression> but i im rescaling so that its of a size that we can look at it and then imagine whats happening to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok does that answer your question", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the ratio of this little short thing to this longer thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is getting much much shorter than this total length", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre absolutely right that were comparing <expression> quantities which are going to <expression> but <expression> of them is much smaller than the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the other case we compared <expression> quantities which were both going to <expression> and they both end up being about  in length", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the previous <expression> was this green <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here its this little tiny bit here and its way shorter than the <expression> distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i wrote minus that that is i replaced <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4733, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "but then i wrote this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is the negative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i show that this goes to <expression> its the same as showing the other <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah ok so this is a very important point and in fact its the very next point that i wanted to make", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely notice that in this calculation it was very important that we used length", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means that the way that were measuring theta is in what are known as radians", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we measure them in degrees for example it would be completely wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "the correct measure is the length along the unit circle which is what radians are", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is only true if we use radians", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again a little warning here that this is in radians", "entities": []}
{"text": "now here <expression> is in radians", "entities": []}
{"text": "the formulas are just wrong if you use other units", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is that the relationship between this picture up here and this picture down here is that im drawing a different shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely what im really imagining here is a much much smaller theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im blowing that up in scale", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this scale of this picture down here is very different from the scale of the picture up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if the angle is very very very small then <expression> has to be very very long in order for me to finish the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words this length is <expression> because thats what im insisting on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im claiming that thats how i define this circle to be of unit radius", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me let me take you through a couple of steps because i think probably other people are also having trouble with this visualization", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> part of the visualization im gonna try to demonstrate on this picture up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> part of the visualization is that i should think of a beak of a bird closing down getting narrower and narrower", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words the angle theta has to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats the <expression> step", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the process that were talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in order to draw that once theta gets incredibly narrow in order to depict that i have to blow the whole picture back up in order be able to see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "otherwise it just disappears on me", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact in the limit <equation> its meaningless", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a flat line", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the whole problem with these tricky limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "its only just a little away that theyre actually useful that you get useful geometric information out of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were just a little away", "entities": []}
{"text": "its supposed to be that theta is open a tiny crack just a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the smallest i can draw it on the board for you to visualize it is using the whole length of the blackboard here for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive opened a little tiny bit and by the time we get to the other end of the blackboard of course its fairly wide", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this angle theta is a very small angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im trying to imagine what happens as this collapses", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when i imagine that i have to imagine a geometric interpretation of both the numerator and the denominator of this quantity here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i claimed the numerator is this little tiny bit over here and the denominator is actually half of this whole length here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the factor of <expression> doesnt matter when youre seeing whether something tends to <expression> or not", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i claimed that if you stare at this its clear that this is much shorter than that vertical curve there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im claiming so this is what you have to imagine is this as it gets smaller and smaller and smaller still that has the same effect of this thing going way way way farther away and this vertical curve getting closer and closer and closer to the green", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that the gap between them gets tiny and goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so not only does it go to <expression> thats not enough for us but it also goes to <expression> faster than this theta goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i hope the evidence is pretty strong here because its so tiny already at this stage", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are going to move forward and youll have to ponder these things some other time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna give you an even harder thing to visualize now so be prepared", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now the next thing that id like to do is to give you a <expression> proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "because it really is important i think to understand this particular fact more thoroughly and also to get a lot of practice with sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna give you a geometric proof of the formula for sine here for the derivative of sine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a geometric proof of this fact", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is for all theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far we only did it for theta  <expression> and now were going to do it for all theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a different proof but it uses exactly the same principles", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want do this by drawing another picture and the picture is going to describe y which is sin theta which is if you like the vertical position of some circular motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im imagining that something is going around in a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "some particle is going around in a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so heres the circle here the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the unit distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "and right now it happens to be at this location p", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe well put p a little over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the angle theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were going to move it", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how far did we move it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we moved it by an angle delta theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we started theta theta is going to be fixed in this argument and were going to move a little bit delta theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were just gonna try to figure out how far the thing moved", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in order to do that weve got to keep track of the height the vertical displacement here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this distance here is the change in y", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the picture is we have something moving around a unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "a point moving around a unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "it moves from angle theta to angle theta plus delta theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the formula for <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats telling us the rate of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright well so lets just try to think a little bit about what this is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all ive already said this and im going to repeat it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how far <expression> moves", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the change in <expression> thats what i said up in the right hand corner there", "entities": []}
{"text": "oops", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright thats not a good idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to draw the diagram again <expression> time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what id like to do is draw this curve here which is a piece of the arc of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really what i want to keep in mind is something that i did also in all these other arguments", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is maybe i should have called this orange that im gonna think of the straight line between", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the straight line approximation to the curve that were always interested in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the straight line is much simpler because then we just have a triangle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact its a right triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so we have the geometry of a right triangle which is going to now let us do all of our calculations", "entities": []}
{"text": "that distance there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so next thing we need is the exponential distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve been talking about continuous distributions", "entities": []}
{"text": "we talked about the uniform and the normal", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression> famous continuous distributions", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve already done all the discrete distributions we need for the entire semester", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we only have <expression> continuous distributions so we kinda have to catch up on the continuous stuff okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next most important <expression> is called the exponential distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <expression> of the biggest topics for the next homework and its <expression> of the most important distributions in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "now weve already seen the exponential distribution a couple of times its just like as part on the previous homework with waiting for the book to be released", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i used it to illustrate universality of the uniform but we havent formally introduced it yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this will be our formal introduction of exponential distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the traditional and im gonna call this a rate parameter", "entities": []}
{"text": "because you dont have to call it lambda its just lambdas the usual terminology", "entities": []}
{"text": "im gonna call it a rate parameter because intuitively we can think of it as the rate at which some type of event occurs okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what special about this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so we say <expression> is exponential lambda thats our notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its always positive so continuous positive random variable thats the pdf", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see why its called the exponential distribution cuz theres an exponential function with a couple constants stuck in there exponential decay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get <expression> just integrating exponential so that means its valid", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we can talk more about what are the special properties of this distribution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>  the integral so i will start the integral at <expression> because this is a positive random variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> up to <expression> of lambda <expression> again thats a very easy integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will just get <expression> <expression> for <expression> greater than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its easy to check that this is correct cuz if you take the derivative of this lambda comes down and you get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you go that way right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and approaches <expression> if you go that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually an easier way to get the mean of course we can just write down the integral and do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before we do that its useful to try to standardize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember what the normal we can reduce any normal to a standard normal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were gonna show right now that if we let <expression>  <expression> then were gonna show that <expression> is exponential of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4803, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "so thats kind of analagous to standardization of the standard normal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that were multiplying i mean its not exactly the same cuz for the normal we subtracted the mean by a standard deviation", "entities": []}
{"text": "here were just saying multiply by something to make it exponential of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if i can get exponential of <expression> its gonna be a lot easier right", "entities": []}
{"text": "then if the lambdas are not there so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since lets just do a quick calculation to show that thats true okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "cuz once we have this relationship than a lot of the times we can just work with exponential of <expression> and then stick in the lambda when we need it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just compute the cdf of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4808, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "<expression> less than or  <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just this is an very easy calculation if you understand cdfs that the cdf of <expression> a <expression> is lambda <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> less than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we take the cdf and plug in <expression> then we just get <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 4820, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "<expression> thats <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the cdf of an exponential of <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just plugged in <expression> here and <expression> cancel okay", "entities": [{"id": 4826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "so its just that <expression> short equation proves that his statement is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "and find the mean and variance and then we can get the general case okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that case now so were letting <expression> be exponential of <expression> and we wanna find the mean and variance okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get the mean <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just by definition expect the value <expression> so its just the integral of <expression> times the pdff <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 4836, "label": "command", "start_offset": 90, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "okay now this is a very standard integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 4837, "label": "method", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "this is the kind of interval youd see in ap calculus when youre learning integration by parts right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all we have to do is let <equation> and let <expression>  this part", "entities": [{"id": 4840, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 4841, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "remember your integration by parts <expression> so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> and <expression>  just integrate this thing right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im just gonna do a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> evaluated from <expression> ero to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its gonna be plus the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4853, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so now weve made it into an easy integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> part is <expression> because if we plug in <equation> we just get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4858, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "so the exponential parts dominant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this part is just <expression> and this part its just <expression> cuz thats an easy integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "or an even cuter way to do it is to say were integrating the exponential <expression> pdf it has to be <expression> otherwise that wasnt a valid pdf", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this course there are actually a lot of integrals we can do not using calculus directly but by recognizing thats a pdf or that kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course thats an easy integral anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay therefore the mean is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for the variance for the variance we can just do <expression> the other way as usual", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is the lotus<expression> while by lotus its immediate of that integral of <expression> this thing we just computed as <expression> okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this integer well then we have to use integration by parts again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im not gonna write out the integration by parts again probably because were gonna learn better ways to do this later", "entities": []}
{"text": "or were gonna actually avoid doing this and get them movements a different way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is called the <expression> moment by the way <expression> is called the <expression> movement that is called the <expression> movement", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay but this is an easy integration by parts in the sense that if let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 4879, "label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "basically its gonna reduce reduce it back down in to an integral that looks like this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its gonna lower the power from <expression> to <expression> so this is like when youre doing integration by parts twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont actually have to do it twice cuz you do it once and then you reduce it to the <expression> we just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre actually doing integration by parts once", "entities": []}
{"text": "and wwe do that we also get <expression> and thats pretty easy to remember okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now coming back to this general exponential so just continuing the notation here <equation> so <equation> and thats gonna have the mean just take expected value of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lambda is a constant that comes out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it has mean <expression> and it has variance", "entities": []}
{"text": "well for the variance take the variance of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember the variance constant comes out squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> but the variance of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the variance is <expression>d", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now we know the mean and the variance", "entities": []}
{"text": "we do not yet know why the exponential is important okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres different reasons why its important", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what i consider the most important reason is whats called the memory list property", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youve already seen the memory list property in the discrete case if you did that practice midterm question", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we havent talked about it in the continuous case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so memoryless property so exponential distribution is memoryless", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to tell you what that means and then check that is true okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so memoryless property means that see if we can remember that midterm practice problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is said something about memorylessness it said no matter how long youve waited then its like youre starting over from fresh okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats what it said right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says that if you have a random variable that intuitively its a random variable that we interpret as a waiting time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre waiting for something to happen right", "entities": []}
{"text": "no just have a concrete example in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose youre just waiting for a phone call right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now is time <expression> okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre waiting to get a call okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "which could come at any time in continuous time right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the geometric is discrete like flipping coins waiting for success right", "entities": []}
{"text": "bernoulli trials wait for success in discrete times cuz they have discrete trials", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is in continuous time youre waiting for the phone call", "entities": []}
{"text": "and suppose that this waiting time has the property that no matter how long you waited just like that time is gone", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not giving you progress towards getting your phone call", "entities": []}
{"text": "its like starting from fresh every time okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the memoryless property means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as an equation what it says is the probability that <expression> is greater than or  <expression> given that <expression> is greater than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "imagine that <expression> is measured in minutes or whatever unit you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "this says youve already waited at least <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve already waited <expression> minutes and you havent gotten your phone call", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know <expression> is greater than or  <expression> okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the probability you would have to wait at least an additional <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "is just the same as the probability x is greater than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because youve started over with the fresh exponential distribution with the same parameter", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the definition of the memoryless property but i hope that this equation kind of intuitively make sense to capture that intuition of memorylessness", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now lets prove that in fact that this equation is satisfied by the exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for the exponential lambda this is the general definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now were assuming <expression> is exponential lambda and lets check that the equation holds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets find the probability that <expression> is greater than or  <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont have to worry about whether its strict inequality here cuz its a continuous random variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just <expression> and this is the <expression> this is called the survival survival function", "entities": []}
{"text": "because whatss the probability that if you think of <expression> rather than thinking of a waiting time thinking of it as like how long someone is gonna live", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then thats the probability that they will live more than at least s seconds so thats a survival thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is actually extremely important in whats called survival analysis in bio statistics as well as in engineering", "entities": []}
{"text": "you wanna figure out how long is a certain piece of electronics gonna last things like that then you need to look at survival functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "well anyway thats just <expression> but the cdf was <expression> so thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve already seen scenarios where we start with a differential equation and then we generate a slope field that describes the solutions to the differential equation and then we use that to visualize those solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i want to do in this video is do an exercise that takes us the other way start with a slope field and figure out which differential equation is the slope field describing the solutions for", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i encourage you to look at each of these options and think about which of these differential equations is being described by this slope field", "entities": []}
{"text": "i encourage you to pause the video right now and try it on your own", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im assuming you have had a go at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets work through each of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way im going to do it is im just going to find some points that seem to be easy to do arithmetic with and well see if the slope described by the differential equation at that point is consistent with the slope depicted in the slope field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know just for simplicity les define <equation> and <equation> for all of these", "entities": [{"id": 4914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "so when <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> differential equation right over here if <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression> then <expression> would be negative <expression> over <expression> or negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> would be negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now is that depicted here", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <equation> and <equation> our slope isnt negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our slope here looks positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can rule this <expression> out", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets try the next <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <equation> and <equation> well then <expression> would be  <expression> minus <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and once again i just picked <expression> and <equation> for convenience", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could have picked any other", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could have picked negative <expression> and negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this just makes the arithmetic a little easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again when you look at that point that weve already looked at our slope is clearly not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a positive slope here so we can rule that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again for this magenta differential equation if <expression> and <expression> are both  <expression> then <expression> minus <expression> is once again going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 4950, "label": "command", "start_offset": 124, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"text": "and weve already seen this slope is not <expression> here so rule that <expression> out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now here we have <expression> plus <expression> so when <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression> our derivate of <expression> with respect to <expression> is going to be <expression> which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this looks interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like this slope right over here could be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this looks like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this looks like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would want to validate some other points but this looks like a really really good candidate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can also see what is happening here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were to just hold <expression> constant at <expression> but increase <expression> along this line we see that the slope is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is getting steeper", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we were to keep <expression> constant and increase <expression> across this line we see that the slope increases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in general we see that the slope increases as we go to the top right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we see that it decreases as we go to the bottom left and both <expression> and <expression> become much much more negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im feeling pretty good about this especially if we can knock this <expression> out here if we can knock that <expression> out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well then when <equation> and <equation> <expression> would be  <expression> and this slope looks larger than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like <expression> but since we are really just eyeballing it lets see if we can find something where this more clearly falls apart", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets look at the situation when they both  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in that case <expression> should still be  <expression> because you have negative <expression> over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "do we see that over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our derivative here looks negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like negative <expression> which is consistent with this yellow differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope here is definitely not a positive <expression> so we could rule this <expression> out as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we should feel pretty confident that this is the differential equation being described", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now that weve done it we can actually think about well okay what are the solutions for this differential equation going to look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it depends where they start or what points they contain", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a solution that contains that point it looks like it might do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you had a solution that contained this point it might do something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course it keeps going", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like it would asymptote towards <equation> this downward sloping", "entities": []}
{"text": "this essentially is the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually no that is not the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the line <equation> so thats this line right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it looks like if the solution contained say this point right over here that would actually be a solution to the differential equation <equation> and you can verify that", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hopefully you found that interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "right now were finishing up with the <expression> unit and id like to continue in this lecture lecture <expression> with some final remarks about exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what id like to do is just review something that i did quickly last time and make a few philosophical remarks about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think that the steps involved were maybe a little tricky and so id like to go through it <expression> more time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we showed was that the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> thing that id like to do is just explain the proof a little bit more clearly than i did last time with fewer symbols or at least with this abbreviation of the symbol here to show you what we actually did", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill just remind you of what we did last time and the <expression> observation was to check rather than the limit of this function but to take the log <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is typically whats done when you have an exponential when you have an exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we found was that the limit here was <expression> as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so last time this is what we did", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just wanted to be careful and show you exactly what the next step is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you exponentiate this fact you take <expression> to this power thats going to tend to <expression> which is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we just observe that this is the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the basic ingredient here is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because the log function is the inverse of the exponential function", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes question", "entities": []}
{"text": "who said it was", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont really know yet from this expression in fact we did some cleverness with limits and derivatives to figure out this limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was a very subtle thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the thing that id like to say  im sorry im going to erase this aside here  but you need to go back to your notes and remember that this is what we did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i want to have room for the next comment that i want to make on this little blackboard here", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we just derived was this property here but i made a claim yesterday and i just want to emphasize it again so that we realized what it is that were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i looked at this backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> way you can think of this is were evaluating this limit and getting an answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "but all equalities can be read both directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can write it the other way <equation> as <expression> goes to <expression> of this expression here", "entities": [{"id": 5028, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so thats just the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we read it backwards what were saying is that this limit is a formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is very typical of mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "you want to always reverse your perspective all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "equations work both ways and in this case we have <expression> different things here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> was what we defined as the base which when you graph <expression> you get slope <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it turns out to be  this limit which we can calculate numerically", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you do this on your calculators you of course will have a way of programming in this number and evaluating it for each <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll have another button available to evaluate this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so another way of saying it is it that theres a relationship between these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of calculus is a matter of getting these relationships", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can look at these things in several different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed thats what were going to be doing at least at the end of today in talking about derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "a lot of times when we talk about derivatives were trying to look at them from several perspectives at once", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so i have to keep on going with exponents because i have <expression> loose end", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> loose end that i did not cover yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres <expression> very important formula thats left and its the derivative of the powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "we actually didnt do this  well we did it for rational numbers <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now were going to check this for all real numbers <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so including all the irrational ones as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is also good practice for using base <expression> and using logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me do this by our <expression> methods that we can use to handle exponential type problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i just rewrite this base <expression> again thats just this formula over here", "entities": [{"id": 5048, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "<equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now i can differentiate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get that <expression> now im going to use prime notation because i dont want to keep on writing that <expression> here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what i can do is i can use the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 5054, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 34}, {"id": 5055, "label": "method", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "the chain rule says that its the derivative of this times the derivative of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of the exponential is just itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the derivative of this guy here well ill write it out once is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5057, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "so whats that ", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this derivative here is well the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just factors out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> now has derivative whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> so this is going to be times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we rewrite it in the customary form which is <expression> we put the <expression> in front <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5069, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just derived the formula for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it didnt matter whether <expression> was rational or irrational its the same proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now i have to show you how method <expression> works as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do method <expression> which we call logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i differentiate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill leave that in the middle because i want to remember the key property of logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> ill differentiate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "later on what im going to use is that this is the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> way of evaluating a logarithmic derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other is to differentiate the explicit function that we have over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is just as we said <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again you can now see by comparing these <expression> pieces of arithmetic that theyre basically the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "pretty much every time you convert to base <expression> or you do logarithmic differentiation itll amount to the same thing provided you dont get mixed up", "entities": []}
{"text": "you generally have to introduce a new symbol here", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand youre dealing with exponents there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its worth it to know both points of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so now i want to make <expression> last remark before we finish with exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill try to sell this to you in a lot of ways as the course goes on but <expression> thing that i want to try to emphasize is that the natural logarithm really is natural", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that the natural log is natural", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the example that were going to use for this illustration is economics", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you are imagining the price of a stock that you own goes down by a dollar thats a totally meaningless statement", "entities": []}
{"text": "it depends on a lot of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular it depends on whether the original price was a dollar or <expression> dollars", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres not much meaning to these absolute numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always the ratios that matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example i just looked up an hour ago the london exchange closed and it was down <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which as i said is pretty meaningless unless you know what the actual total of this index is", "entities": []}
{"text": "it turns out it was <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the change in the price divided by the price which in this case is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is what matters", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this case it happens to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what happened today", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5099, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the  let me put a little box around it  the formula of logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me just emphasize that it has an actual significance and its the <expression> thats used by economists and people who are modeling prices of things all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "they never use absolute prices when there are large swings", "entities": []}
{"text": "they always use the log of the price", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres no point in using <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those give you junk", "entities": []}
{"text": "they give you an extra factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the natural log thats the obvious <expression> to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "its completely straightforward that this is a simpler expression than using <expression> and having a factor of <expression> there which would just mess everything up", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so this is just <expression> illustration", "entities": []}
{"text": "anything that has to do with ratios is going to encounter logarithms", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats pretty much it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all i want to say for now anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres lots more to say but well be saying it when we do applications of derivatives in the <expression> unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what id like to do is to start a review", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to run through what we did in this unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you approximately what i expect from you on the test thats coming up tomorrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well so lets get started with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a review of unit <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im just going to put on the board all of the things that you need to think about anyway keep in your head", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are what are called general formulas for derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there are the specific ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me just remind you what the general formulas are", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres what you do to differentiate a sum a multiple of a function the product rule the quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are several general formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres <expression> more which is the chain rule which im going to say just a little bit more about", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of a function of a function is the derivative of the function times the derivative of the other function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here ive abbreviated <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so this is <expression> of <expression> ways of writing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other way is also <expression> that you can keep in mind and you might find easier to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "its probably a good idea to remember both formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the last type of general formula that we did was implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you do implicit differentiation you have an equation and you dont try to solve for the unknown function", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just put it in its simplest form and you differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we actually did this in particular for inverses", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was a very very key method for calculating the inverses of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its also true that logarithmic differentiation is of this type", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a transformation", "entities": []}
{"text": "were differentiating something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "were transforming the equation by taking its logarithm and then differentiating", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so there are a number of different ways this is applied", "entities": []}
{"text": "it can also be applied anyway these are <expression> of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe in parenthesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are just examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill try to give examples of at least a few of these rules later", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the specific functions that you know how to differentiate well you know how to differentiate now <expression> thanks to what i just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what youll find is that its much more convenient to remember the derivatives of these as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so memorize all of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right and then we had <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we had the inverses of the trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are the ones youre responsible for", "entities": []}
{"text": "you should have enough time anyway to work out anything else if you know these", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so basically the idea is you have a bunch of special formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have a bunch of general formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put them together and you can generate pretty much anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so lets do a few examples before going on with the review", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so i do want to do a few examples in sort of increasing level of difficulty in how you would combine these things together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all you should remember that if you differentiate the <expression> function thats just  oh i just realized that i wanted to say something else before  so forget that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well do that in a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted to make some general remarks", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres <expression> rule that you discussed in my absence which is the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i do want to make just a couple of remarks about the chain rule now to remind you of what it is and also to present some consequences", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a little bit of extra on the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> thing that i want say is that we didnt really fully explain why its true", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i do want to just explain it by example okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so imagine that you have a function which is say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5130, "label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then obviously <expression> is changing <expression> times as fast as <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the issue is this number here <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if <expression> is a function of something say <expression> shifted by some other constant here then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now these terms dont matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "the constant terms dont matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the consequence if we put them together is that <equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so this is in a nutshell why the chain rule works", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why these rates multiply", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> thing that i wanted to say about the chain rule is that it has a few consequences that make some of the other rules a little easier to remember or possibly to avoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "the messiest rule in my humble opinion is the quotient rule which is kind of a nuisance to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just remind you if you take just the reciprocal of a function and you differentiate it theres another way of looking at this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its actually the way that i use so i want to encourage you to think about it this way too", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now instead of using the quotient rule which we couldve used we can use the chain rule here with the power <expression> which works by the power law", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is this ", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here ive applied the chain rule rather than the quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly suppose i wanted to derive the full quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now this may or may not be easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is <expression> way of remembering whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you convert it to <expression> and you differentiate that now i can use the product rule on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course i have to use the chain rule and this rule as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression> the inverse plus <expression> and then i have to differentiate the <expression> inverse", "entities": [{"id": 5163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "thats the formula right up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> way of doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this actually explains the funny minus sign when you differentiate <expression> in the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other formula the other way that we did it was by putting this over a common denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "the common denominator was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this comes from this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the <expression> term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> term we have to multiply by an extra factor of <expression> because we have a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"id": 5174, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so this is the quotient rule as we wrote it down in lecture and this is just another way of remembering it or deriving it without remembering it if you just remember the chain rule and the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so youll find that in many contexts its easier to do <expression> or the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now im ready to differentiate the secant and a few such functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well do some examples here here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the way i think of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the formula here is just what", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now this is usually written in a different fashion so thats why im doing this for a reason actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is although there are several formulas for things with trig functions there are usually <expression> ways of writing something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im writing this <expression> down so that you know what the standard way of presenting it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens here is that we have <expression> minus signs cancelling", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a perfectly acceptable answer but theres a customary way in which is written", "entities": []}
{"text": "its written <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the form thats generally used when you see these formulas written in textbooks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you know you need to watch out because if you ever want to use this kind of calculus youll have not be put off by all the <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so getting slightly more complicated how about if we differentiate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate the <expression> thats just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and plugging in the formula that we had before thats <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> also has a very nice form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might say that this is kind of an ugly function but the strange thing is that the natural log was invented before the exponential by a guy named napier exactly in order to evaluate functions like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the functions that people cared about a lot because they were used in navigation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the multiplication he encoded using a logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these were invented long before people even knew about exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it was a surprise actually that it was connected to exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the natural log was invented before the <expression> and everything else exactly for this kind of purpose", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so this is a nice function which was very important so that your ships wouldnt crash into the reef", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets continue here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres another kind of function that i want to discuss with you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are the kinds in which theres a choice as to which of these rules to apply", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill just give a couple of examples of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "there usually is a better and a worse way so let me illustrate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay yet another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope youve seen some of these before", "entities": []}
{"text": "say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5197, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "so its a little bit more complicated than what we had before because there were several more symbols here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what should we do at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres <expression> choice which i claim is a bad idea and that is to expand this out to the <expression> power", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a bad idea because its very long", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then your answer will also be very long", "entities": []}
{"text": "it will fill the entire exam paper for instance", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we use the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so fortunately this is relatively easy using the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just think of this box as being the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we take <expression> times this guy to the <expression> times the derivative of this guy which is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5206, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 5207, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}, {"id": 5208, "label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "and this is filling this in its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all you need to do differentiate things like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the chain rule is very effective", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im not really willing to answer too many questions about whats going to be on the exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the question that was just asked is exactly the kind of question im very happy to answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay the question was in what form is what form is an acceptable answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in real life that is a really serious question", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you ask a computer a question and it gives you <expression> sheets of printout its useless", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you really care what form answers are in and indeed somebody might really care what this thing to the <expression> power is and then you would be forced to discuss things in terms of that other functional form", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the purposes of this exam this is okay form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact any correct form is an okay form", "entities": []}
{"text": "i recommend strongly that you not try to simplify things unless we tell you to", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes it will be to your advantage to simplify things", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes well say simplify", "entities": []}
{"text": "it takes a good deal of experience to know when its really worth it to simplify expressions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is what is this derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres an answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the end of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a more customary form", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is answer is okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "same issue", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "do you have to show the work", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i ask you what is <expression> then if you wrote down this answer or you wrote down this answer showing no work that would be acceptable", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the question was derive the formula for this from the formula for the derivative of the cosine or something like that then it would not be acceptable", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd have to carry out this arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words typically this will come up for instance in various contexts", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just basically have to follow directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "the short answer to that is yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i will be getting to that when i discuss the rest of the material here", "entities": []}
{"text": "were almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so let me just finish these examples with <expression> last <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the last example that id like to write down is the <expression> that i promised you in the <expression> lecture namely to differentiate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "basically youre supposed to be able to differentiate any function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the <expression> that we mentioned at the beginning", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its just   i have to differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to use the chain rule  its  the exponential times the derivative of this expression here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the <expression> step", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have to apply the product rule here", "entities": [{"id": 5222, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 5223, "label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "so i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i differentiate the <expression> factor so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "add to it what happens when i differentiate the <expression> factor leaving alone the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the end of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "it wasnt that hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course it requires you to remember all of the rules and a lot of formulas underlying them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats consistent with what i just told you", "entities": []}
{"text": "i told you that you wanted to know this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i told you that you needed to know this product rule and that you needed to know the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i guess there was <expression> more thing the derivative of <expression> came into play there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so of these formulas we used <expression> of them in this <expression> calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now what other things did we talk about in unit <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the main other thing that we talked about was the definition of a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also there was sort of a goal which was to get to the meaning of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are things  so we had a couple of ways of looking at it or at least a couple that im going to emphasize right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> let me remind you what the formula is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative is the limit as delta <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats it and this is certainly going to be a central focus here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you want to be able to recognize this formula in a number of ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we use this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> thing we did was we calculated a bunch of these rates of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact more or less theyre the ones which are written right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this list of functions here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now which ones did we start out with just straight from the definition here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "there were a whole bunch of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we started out with a function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there was a little bit of subtlety with <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got them using something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt quite get them all the way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got them using the case <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got them from the derivative at <expression> we got the formulas for the derivatives of sine and cosine", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that was an argument which involved plugging in <expression> and running through", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "we also did <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that may be it", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh yeah i think thats about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "that may be about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "it isnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so let me make a connection here which you probably havent yet made which is that we did it for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we also did it for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so sorry i shouldnt write primes because thats not consistent with the claim there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i differentiated the product i differentiated the quotient using the same <expression> notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess i forgot that because i wasnt there when it happened", "entities": []}
{"text": "so look these are the ones that you do by this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course you might have to reduce them to other things", "entities": []}
{"text": "these involve using something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> involves using the slope of this function at <expression> just the way the sine and the cosine did", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> involves the slopes of the individual functions <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> also involves the individual so in other words it doesnt get you all the way through to the end but its expressed in terms of something simpler in each of these cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i could go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt do these in class but youre certainly <expression> is a perfectly okay <expression> on <expression> of the exams", "entities": []}
{"text": "we ask you for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words im not claiming that its going to be <expression> on this list but it certainly can be any <expression> of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were not going to ask you to go all the way through to the beginning in these formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are also some fundamental limits that i certainly want you to know about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these you can derive in reverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will describe that now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me also emphasize the following thing i want to read this backwards now", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the theme from the very beginning of this lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if youre given the function <expression> you can figure out its derivative by this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the formula for this in terms of whats on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand you can also use the formula in that direction and if you know the slope of something you can figure out what the limit is", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill call it <expression> so its clearer to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose you look at this limit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i claim that you should recognize that is the derivative with respect to <expression> of the function <equation> which of course we know to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is reading this formula in reverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "its recognizing that <expression> of these limits  let me rewrite this again here  <expression> of these socalled difference quotient limits is a derivative", "entities": [{"id": 5276, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "and since we know a formula for that derivative we can evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lastly theres <expression> other type of thing which i think you should know", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the ones you do with difference quotients", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are also other formulas that you want to be able to derive", "entities": []}
{"text": "you want to be able to derive formulas by implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words the basic idea is to take whatever equation youve got and simplify it as much as possible without insisting that you solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not necessarily the most appropriate way to get the rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "the much simpler formula is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that <expression> is easier to differentiate implicitly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i should say do this kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats if you like a typical derivation that you might see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres <expression> last type of problem that youll face and its the other thing that i claim we discussed", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it goes all the way back to the <expression> lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the last thing that well be talking about is tangent lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the geometric point of view of a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well be doing more of this in next the unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all youll be expected to be able to compute the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats often fairly straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing is to graph <expression> the derivative of a function", "entities": [{"id": 5286, "label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and the <expression> thing which im going to throw in here because i regard it in a sort of geometric vein although its got an analytical aspect to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you combine the <expression> together you get something else", "entities": [{"id": 5289, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and so this is to recognize differentiable functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so how do you do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we really only have <expression> way of doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to check the left and right tangents", "entities": []}
{"text": "they must be ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this is a property that you should be familiar with from some of your exercises", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the idea is simply that if the tangent line exists its the same from the right and from the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay now im going to just do <expression> example here from this sort of qualitative sketching skill to give you an example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im going to do is im going to draw a graph of a function like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to do underneath is draw the graph of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the function <equation> and here im going to draw the graph of the function <equation> right underneath it", "entities": [{"id": 5294, "label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "so now lets think about what its supposed to look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> step that you need to make in order to do this is to draw a few tangent lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to draw <expression> down here", "entities": [{"id": 5297, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and im going to draw <expression> up here", "entities": [{"id": 5299, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "now the tangent lines here  notice that the slope of these tangent lines are all positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so everything i draw down here is going to be above the <expression>axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "furthermore as i go further to the left they get steeper and steeper", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theyre getting higher and higher", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the function is coming down like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "it starts up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill draw it in green to illustrate the graph here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this function here", "entities": []}
{"text": "as we get farther out its getting flatter and flatter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its leveling off but above the axis like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of the things to emphasize is you should not expect the derivative to look like the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its totally different", "entities": []}
{"text": "its keeping track at each point of its tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand you should get some kind of physical feel for it and well be practicing this more in the next unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me give you an example of a function which does exactly this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate it you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this plot above is roughly speaking the logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this plot underneath is the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we still have time for <expression> question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so fire away", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats in a lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "im happy to do it right now but its going to take me a whole <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres how you do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is hopeless to differentiate so i rewrite it as <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5309, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "and now i have to differentiate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i differentiate it i get the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a hard step", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the left side i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5315, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so im doing this super fast because we have <expression> seconds left", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is the hard step right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it needs for you to know that <equation> over oh bad bad bad secant squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was ahead of myself so fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need have known this in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the input into this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what we have is that <equation> which is the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last bit of the problem is to rewrite this in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5321, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "and that you have to do with a right triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is <expression> and this is <expression> then the angle is <expression> because the tangent of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this expresses the fact that the tangent of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the hypotenuse is the square root of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the <expression> is <expression> divided by that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing is <expression> divided by the <expression> the quantity squared", "entities": [{"id": 5333, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "so and then the last little bit here since im racing along is that its <expression> which i incorrectly wrote over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so good luck on the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you tomorrow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far weve seen things about vectors equation of planes motions in space and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "basically weve done geometry in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "but calculus really is about studying functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to actually move on to studying functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this new unit what well do over the next <expression> weeks or so will be about functions of several variables and their derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> of all we should try to figure out how we are going to think about functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember if you have a function of <expression> variable that means you have a quantity that depends on <expression> parameter", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe <expression> depends on the variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for example a function that you all know is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we would represent that is maybe just by plotting the graph of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the graph of a function we plot <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5343, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and the graph of a <expression> function that looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now lets say that we had actually a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that the value of <expression> depends actually on <expression> different parameters say if the variables are <expression> and <expression> or they can have any names you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so given values of the <expression> parameters <expression> and <expression> the function will give us a number that well call <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that depends on <expression> and <expression> according to some formula ok not very surprising so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example i can give you the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course as with functions of <expression> variable we dont need things to be defined everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes there is the domain of definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> is defined all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i tell you say <equation> well this is only defined if <expression> is nonnegative", "entities": [{"id": 5361, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "if i tell you <equation> thats only defined if <expression> is not <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so these are mathematical examples given by explicit formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course theres physical examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example so examples coming from real life so for example you can look at the temperature at the certain point on the surface of the earth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you use maybe longitude and latitude thats <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have <expression>  the temperature at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact because temperature depends also may be on how high up you are", "entities": []}
{"text": "it depends on elevation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its actually a function of maybe <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it also depends on time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact maybe its a function of <expression> in <expression> coordinates in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you see that realworld functions can depends on a lot of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our goal will be to understand how to deal with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now you will see very soon but actually its already tricky enough to picture a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are going to focus on the case of functions of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well see that if we have more than <expression> variables then its harder to plot the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "we cannot draw with the graph looks like anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the tools are the same the notion of partial derivatives grade and vector and so on all the tools that we will develop work exactly the same way no matter how many variables you have", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill say for simplicity well focus mostly on <expression> or sometimes <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it works the same in any number of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the <expression> question is how to visualize a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> thing we can do is try to draw the graph of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5382, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "so maybe i should say <expression> which is a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> answer will be we can try to look at its graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the idea is the same as with <expression> variable namely we look at all the possible values of the parameters <expression> and <expression> and for each of them we plot a point whose height is the value of a function at these parameters", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well plot lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and now that will become actually a surface in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and if we take all of these points together they will give us some surface that sits in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh a function of <expression> variables shorthand", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets say how to visualize a function of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so how do we do that concretely", "entities": []}
{"text": "say that i give you a formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we try to represent it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do our <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i give you a function <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5406, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "ok so it looks a little bit silly because it doesnt depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its still a valid function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just happens to be constant with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to draw the graph we look at the surface in space defined by <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5412, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "what kind of surface is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a plane ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we want to draw it <equation> will look well lets put <expression> axis", "entities": [{"id": 5415, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "lets put <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets put <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i look at what happens in the <expression> <expression> plane in the plane of a blackboard it will just look like a line that goes downward with slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so it will be this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what happens if i change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i change <expression> nothing happens because <expression> doesnt appear in this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact if instead of setting <equation> i set <equation> im in front of the blackboard or <expression> <expression> at the back", "entities": [{"id": 5428, "label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "well it still looks exactly the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have this plane that actually contains the <expression> axis and slopes downwards with slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of hard to draw", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you see immediately what the big problem with graphs will be", "entities": []}
{"text": "but these pictures are hard to read", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats our <expression> graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok a question so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets say that we have a slightly more complicated function", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets draw another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i give you <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5433, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so we should try to picture what the surface <equation> looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well maybe you are very fast and figured out what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if not then we need to work piece by piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe it will help if we understand <expression> what it does in the plane of the blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we look at it in the <expression> <expression> plane that means we set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5440, "label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "and then <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a parabola pointing downwards and starting at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we should draw maybe this downward parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "it starts at <expression> and it cuts the <expression> axis at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> is <expression> that gives us <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we might have an idea of what it might look like or maybe not", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets get more slices", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what it does in the <expression> <expression> plane this other vertical plane thats coming towards us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the <expression> <expression> plane if we set <equation> we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5458, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "its again a parabola going downwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so im going to try to draw a parabola that goes downward but now to the front and to the back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are starting to have a slightly better idea but we still dont know whether the cross section of this thing might be round square something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it wants more confirmation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we might want to also figure out where the surface intersects the <expression> <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we hit the <expression> <expression> plane when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <expression> should be <expression> that becomes <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is a circle of radius <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the unit size", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that here we actually have the unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you should imagine that you have this thing that when you slice it by a vertical plane looks like a downwards parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its actually a surface of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can rotate it around the <expression> axis ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you stare long enough at that equation youll actually see that yes we know that it had to be like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but see so these are useful ways of trying to guess what the graph looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course the other way is to just ask your computer to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you know you will get that kind of formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well i can leave it on if you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "no because i plotted a different function that i will show you later", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it goes this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean if you want its really going downward", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes i agree that the sheet is upside down", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because i plotted something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in fact so i plotted in my computer was actually <expression> that looks like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "see its the same with a parabola going upwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want to see more examples i have various examples to show well heres the graph <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see so that <expression> is kind of interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like a saddle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look at it in the <expression> <expression> plane then its a parabola going up <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we see to the left and to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you put it in the <expression> <expression> plane then thats a parabola going downwards <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a parabola going downwards in <expression> direction upwards in the other <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and together they form this surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course you can plot much more complicated functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> well if you can read very small things you can see the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt matter just to show you that you can put a formula into a computer it will show you a picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats pretty good", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean you can see that it can get a bit cluttered because maybe those features that are hidden behind or maybe we have trouble seeing if we dont have a computer that looks very readable", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is kind of hard to visualize sometimes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is another way to plot the functions of <expression> variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets call it the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the contour plot is a very elegant solution to the problem that its difficult to draw to space pictures on a sheet of paper or on a blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "so instead lets try to represent the function of <expression> variables by just the map you know the same way that when you walk around you have actually geographical maps that fit on a piece of paper that tell you about what the real world looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what contour plot looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its an <expression> <expression> plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that you have a bunch of curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what the curves represent are the elevations on the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example this curve might correspond to all the points where <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that curve might be all the points where <equation> and <equation> and so on ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you see you this kind of plot youre supposed to think that the graph of the function sits somewhere in space above that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its like a map telling you how high things are", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what you would want to do with the function really is be able to tell quickly whats the value at a given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets say i want to look at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know that <expression>  is somewhere between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually its much faster to read than the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the graph i might have to look carefully and then measure things and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i can just raise the value of <expression> by comparing with the nearby lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me try to make that more precise", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it shows all the points where <expression>  some fixed values some fixed constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these constants typically are chosen at regular intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example here i chose <expression> <expression> <expression> and they could continue with <expression> minus <expression> and so on", "entities": [{"id": 5498, "label": "command", "start_offset": 106, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "so <expression> way to think about it how does this relate to the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats the same thing as cutting i mean we slice the graph by horizontal planes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so horizontal planes have equations of a form <expression>  some constant <equation> <equation> <equation> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe the graph of my function will be some sort of plot out there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i slice it by the plane <equation> then i will get the level curve which is the point where <equation> and so thats called a level curve of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and so we repeat the process with maybe <equation> and we get another level curve and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we squish all of them up and thats how we get the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so each of these lines imagine that this is like some mountain or something that you are hiking on", "entities": []}
{"text": "each of these lines tells you how you could move to stay at a constant height if you want to get to the other side of the mountain but without ever going up or down", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would just walk along that path and it will get you there without effort", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact if you have been talking about hiking on mountains well thats exactly what a topographical map is about", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i need to zoom a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a topographic map this <expression> from the us geological survey shows you basically all the level curves of an altitude function on a piece of land", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know that if you walk right along these curves you will stay along the same height", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know that if you walk towards these dont have numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me find a place with numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "here there is a <expression> in the middle", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course we dont have a formula for that function but we have a contour plot and thats what we need actually to understand whats going on there", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so another example of contour plots well youve probably seen various versions of these temperature maps", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats supposed to be how warm it is right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of having curves it has all these colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the effect is the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look at the separations between consecutive colors these are the level curves of a function that tells you the temperature at a given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so these are examples of contour plots in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok no questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets do a couple of examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets start with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try to plot it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression> when <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the level <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "wheres the level <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression> when negative <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means when <expression> is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you go to minus <expression> and that will be where my level <expression> is and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> when <expression> is negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is negative <expression> when <expression> is <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that convincing", "entities": []}
{"text": "do you see how we got that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok let me do it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont see anybody nodding so thats kind of bad news", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i want to know where is the level curve say <expression> i try to set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5546, "label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "<equation> means that negative <expression> is <expression> means that <equation> and <expression>  minus <expression> is this horizontal line on this chart", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and same with the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see on the map that the value of a function doesnt depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you move parallel to the <expression> axis nothing happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you move in the <expression> direction it decreases at a constant rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why the contours are evenly spaced", "entities": []}
{"text": "how spaced out they are tells you actually how steep things are", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that corresponds exactly to that picture except that here we draw <expression> coming to the front and <expression> to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an unfortunate consequence of the usual way of plotting things in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so these horizontal lines here correspond actually to horizontal lines here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok or maybe i will write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5561, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "its really the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> lets see where is this function  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we said <expression> is <expression> in the unit circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the <expression> level well lets say that this is my unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats where its at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats only going to be here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just a single point", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a circle of radius square root of <expression> which is about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its somewhere here", "entities": []}
{"text": "then minus <expression> similarly will be <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5579, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "square root of <expression> is about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then minus <expression> will be of radius <expression> and so on", "entities": [{"id": 5586, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so what i want to show here is that they are getting closer and closer apart ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "things dont change if i rotate", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this top here is kind of flat", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it gets steeper and steeper", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we observe on that picture there", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe actually ill make it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so it looks exactly the same as this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the difference is if you can see the numbers which are not there so you can see them then you would know that instead of decreasing as we move out this <expression> is increasing as we go out", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats where we use actually the labels on the level curves that tell us whether things are going up or down", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the contour plots look exactly the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the contour plot well let me actually zoom out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the contour plot looks like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you look on the plot say that you started at the saddle point in the middle and you try to stay at the same level", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it looks like a mountain pass right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually on the map they look exactly like this too these crossing lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so these are things that go on the side of the <expression> mountains that are to the left and right and stay at the same height as the mountain pass", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand if you go along the <expression> direction to the left or to the right then you go towards positive values", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the equation for the function was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can try to plot them by hand and confirmed that it does look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i trust my computer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally this <expression> well so the contour plot looks a bit complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can see <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then at some point in the middle we have a mountain pass", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we see the <expression> crossing lines again like on the plot of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so at this saddle point here if we go north or south then we go down on either side to the valley", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we go east or west then we go towards the mountains", "entities": []}
{"text": "well go up", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok does that make sense a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so reading plots is not easy but hopefully well get used to it very soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so actually lets say well ok so i want to point out <expression> thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i can ask myself is the value of the function increase or decrease in each of these situations", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats the kind of thing that the contour plot can tell me very quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok so say for example that i have a piece of contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "that looks you know like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe this is <equation> and this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that i start at the point say at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so here i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly i can tell that if <expression> increases then <expression> well it looks like if i increase <expression> then <expression> will also increase", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if <expression> decreases then <expression> decreases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the kind of qualitative analysis that we can do easily from the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe wed like to actually be more precise in that and tell how fast <expression> changes if i change <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so to find the rate of change thats exactly where we use derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so we are going to have to deal with partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will explain to you soon why partial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its defined as a limit when delta <expression> goes to <expression> of the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry its not going to fit", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to go to the next line", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be the limit as delta <expression> goes to <expression> of the rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the change in <expression> between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes you write delta <expression> for the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you take the limit of this rate of increase as delta <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now of course if you have a formula for <expression> then you know at least you should know i suspect most of you know how to actually take the derivative of a function from its formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry and i should also tell you what this means on the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i plot the graph of a function and to have my point <expression> and here i have <expression> how do i see the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i look at the tangent line to the graph and the slope of the tangent line is <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and not every function has a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have functions that are not regular enough to actually have a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this class we are not going to actually worry too much about differentiability", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its good at least to be aware that you cant always take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so yes and what else do i want to remind you of", "entities": []}
{"text": "is this kind of familiar to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah i mean maybe with different notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe you called that delta <expression> or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe you called that <expression> or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its the usual approximation formula using the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you put more terms then you get the dreaded taylor approximation that i know you guys dont like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is how do we do the same for a function of <expression> variables <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the difficulty there is we can change <expression> or we can change <expression> or we can change both", "entities": []}
{"text": "and presumably the manner in which <expression> changes will be different depending on whether we change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why we have several different notions of derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok we have a notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this symbol is partial", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its a special notation for partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and essentially what it means is we are going to do a derivative where we care about only <expression> variable at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why its partial", "entities": []}
{"text": "its missing the other variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a function of several variables doesnt have the usual derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has only partial derivatives for each variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so here im actually not changing <expression> at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just changing <expression> and looking at the rate of change with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have the same with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this time i keep <expression> the same but i change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the definition of a partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we say that a function is differentiable if these things exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so most of the functions well see are differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well actually learn how to compute their partial derivatives without having to do this because well just have the usual methods for computing derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact i claim you already know how to take partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see what it means geometrically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so geometrically my function can be represented by this graph and i fix some point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to ask myself what happens if i change the value of well <expression> keeping <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i keep <expression> constant and change <expression> it means that im moving forwards or backwards parallel to the <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that determines for me the vertical plane parallel to the <expression> <expression> plane when i fix <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means its the rate of change if i move along this curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact if i look at the slope of this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i draw the tangent line to this slice then the slope will be partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think i have a better picture of that somewhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes here it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats the same picture just with different colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i take the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "i slice it by a vertical plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get the curve and now i take the slope of that curve and that gives me the partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i fix <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that i slice by a plane thats parallel to the blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get a curve and i looked at the slope of that curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its just a matter of formatting <expression> variable setting it constant and looking at the other <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how to compute these things well we actually to find well theres a piece of notation i havent told you yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so another notation you will see i think this is what <expression> uses a lot in physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is what <expression> uses a lot in applied math which is the same thing as physics but with different notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so it just too different notations partial <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they are the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we just treat <expression> as a constant and <expression> as a variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and vice versa if we want to find partial with aspect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just finish with <expression> quick example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that they give you <equation> then partial <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5728, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "well lets take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here its <expression> times a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "derivative of <equation> times the constant plus whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5732, "label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "<expression> because its a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you do instead <expression> then this is actually a constant times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its fairly easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to keep remembering which <expression> is a variable and which <expression> isnt", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so more about this next time and we will also learn about maxima and minima in several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets now attempt to find a solution for the logistic differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we already found some constant solutions we can think through that a little bit just as a little bit of review from the last few videos", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll just stay at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is nice because thats what would actually happen in a real population", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives us the constant solution that <equation> thats <expression> solution of this differential equation not that interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "a <expression> population will never grow or change", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other constant solution is what if our population started at the maximum of what the environment could sustain and in that situation this term is going to be <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> minus <expression> is <expression> and so in there the population would also not change", "entities": [{"id": 5761, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "it would just stay at <expression> and so the rate of change would just stay at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats another constant solution that we start at the maximum population and then this differential equation tells us a scenario that never changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we said hey look there could be something interesting that happens if our initial condition which we called <expression> subnot thats our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can imagine a scenario where we asymptote towards <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can solve this to find this this <expression> to find the actual analytic expression for this <expression> right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is interesting this is what could be used to model populations that would be more consistent with a malthusian mindset", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if we can do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "to do that we just have to realize this is a separable differential equation and were assuming is a function of <expression> were going to solve for an <expression> that satisfies this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just have to separate it from the explicit ts but there are no explicit ts here so its quite easy to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do is im going to take this part right over here and im going to divide both sides by that", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to leave the r on the right hand side itll make things i think a little bit easier as we try to solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be  <expression> times <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5783, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 5784, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "another way we could think about it well actually let me just continue to tackle it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get that and now what i want to do is take the antiderivative of both sides with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just going to be rt times some constant but whats this going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is kind of this messy thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe if we could break this out if we can expand this into <expression> fractions do a little bit of partial fraction expansion maybe we can come up with an expression thats a little bit easier to find the antiderivative of", "entities": []}
{"text": "im hoping that i can find an <expression> and a <expression> where <expression>  this business", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can find an <expression> and a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just partial fraction expansion if this looks unfamiliar to you i encourage you to review that part on khan academy", "entities": []}
{"text": "do a search for partial fraction expansion on khan academy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well just add these <expression> right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just adding fractions with unlike denominators", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be  this<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can try to think about what is <expression> and <expression> going to be ", "entities": []}
{"text": "what can they be ", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have a constant term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have any <expression> term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats pretty nice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can say that <equation> <equation> and that if <equation> we have negative <expression> <expression> plus <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5823, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 5826, "label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "well whats <expression> going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> would be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can rewind the video and review that if you find it necessary so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how does this help us", "entities": []}
{"text": "well hey you probably might be recognizing the antiderivative of <expression> and you might even see this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just think through this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the antiderivative of <expression> is a natural log just did a new color is a natural log of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could do the same thing over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice i have an expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "what would be the derivative of this expression right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be negative <expression> if im talking the derivative with respect to <expression> it would be negative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a positive <expression> here and i could even make it negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can turn this i can clear this out of the way instead of having a positive there i could have i guess i could say a double negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write this in a new color", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i were to take the derivative of this with respect to <expression> so the derivative with respect to <expression> of the <expression> its going to be the derivative of this with respect to <expression> which is that which is what we just found", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so copy and paste", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be that its going to be that", "entities": []}
{"text": "times the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> just straight out of the chain rule <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5861, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "actually why not lets just do that just to make it clear cause this really isnt so much differential equations but sometimes some of the calculus that we learned not too long ago and even frankly some of the algebra its nice to not skip steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i distribute this edit paste", "entities": []}
{"text": "woops i wanted to copy and paste", "entities": []}
{"text": "so copy and paste so i have that and then i have i can copy and paste so that im just distributing this business right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get that now let me clean it up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have that right over here and of course we have this being  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take the antiderivative of this with respect to <expression> well im just going to get this minus this right over that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to assume that my <expression> meets this assumption right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to assume assume <expression> is going to be less than <expression> and greater than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that this thing this <expression> is always going to be positive and if <expression> is always between <expression> and <expression> that means that this thing is always going to be positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that helps me clear things up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me do it in this color", "entities": []}
{"text": "that helps me get rid of that helps me get rid of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can instead throw some parentheses here and why dont i subtract the <expression> from both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would get rid of it here so edit cut and paste so i have the <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know im overwriting my own work which is not making it look as clean as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just trying to clean it up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have an arbitrary constant that i havent really solved for yet minus another constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just call this some other constant let me just call it a general <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just call this <expression> so clear and im just going to call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am just going to call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i could even simplify this a little bit but actually i just realized im <expression> minutes into this video which is longer than i like to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue this in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was getting excited because im so close", "entities": []}
{"text": "im so close to solving for an <expression> that satisfies our logistic differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "very very exciting", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do some more examples with exact differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im getting these problems from page <expression> of my old college differential equations books", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> edition of elementary differential equations by william boyce and richard diprima", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to make sure they get credit that im not making up these problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "im getting it from their book", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so im just going to give a bunch of equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to figure out if theyre exact and if they are exact well use what we know about exact differential equations to figure out their solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> <expression> they have is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is our <expression> of <expression> and <expression> although this is only a function of <expression> and then this is our <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could say thats <expression> or thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could also say that if this is exact well <expression> lets", "entities": []}
{"text": "this exact before we start talking about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theres no <expression> here so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate of change that this changes with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the rate of change this changes with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are just constants from an <expression> point of view so this is all going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we do see that theyre both <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually we dont have to use exact equations here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well do it just so that we get used to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you look here you actually could have figured out that this is actually a separable equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway this is exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "so knowing that its exact it tells us that theres some function <expression> where psi is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where <expression>  this function  <expression> and <expression> i shouldnt say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we can figure out <expression> then we can rewrite this equation as <expression> the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5944, "label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "let me switch colors or its going to get monotonous", "entities": []}
{"text": "this right here if we can find a <expression> where the partial with respect to <expression> is this the partial with respect to <expression> is this then this can be rewritten as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do we know that", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> using the partial derivative chain rules is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this partial with respect to <expression> thats this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this partial with respect to <expression> is this times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the whole point of exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway so lets figure out what our <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually before we figure out if the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> then if you integrate both sides you just the solution of this equation is <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 5958, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 141}]}
{"text": "so using this information if we can solve for pression> then we know that the solution of this differential equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if we have some initial conditions we could solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets integrate both sides of this equation with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5964, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}, {"id": 5966, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and then we get <equation> plus some function of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 5969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "lets call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember normally when you take an antiderivative you have just <expression> here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can kind of say we took an antipartial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you took a partial derivative with respect to <expression> not only do you lose constants thats why we have a plus <expression> normally but you also lose anything thats a function of just <expression> and not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example take the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> youre going to get this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the partial derivative of a function purely of <expression> with respect to <expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it will disappear", "entities": []}
{"text": "so anyway we take the antiderivative of this we get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we use this information", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we use this information", "entities": []}
{"text": "we take the partial of this expression and we say well the partial of this expression with respect to <expression> has to  this and then we can solve for <expression> of <expression> then well be done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this part is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take the partial with respect to <expression> its <expression> because these are constants from a <expression> point of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <expression> which is the partial of psi with respect to <expression>  this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if we wanted to figure out what <expression> is we get <expression> just integrate both sides with respect to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6000, "label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 91}, {"id": 6001, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 102}]}
{"text": "now you could have a plus <expression> there but if you watched the previous example youll see that that <expression> kind of merges with the other <expression> so you dont have to worry about it right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is our <expression> function as we know it now not worrying about the plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6007, "label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "it is <expression> and <equation> plus <expression> which we figured out is this plus <expression> minus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6013, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 38}, {"id": 6014, "label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 85}, {"id": 6015, "label": "command", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"text": "and we know a solution of our original differential equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution of our differential equation is this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> plus <expression> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6021, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "if you had some additional conditions you could test it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i encourage you to test this out on this original equation or i encourage you to take the derivative of <expression> and prove to yourself that if you took the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> here implicitly that you would get this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway lets do another <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets clear image", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the more examples you see the better", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see this <expression> says <expression> plus <expression> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "so whats the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial of this with respect to <expression> just this part right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of this with respect to <expression> is different than the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we cant solve this using our exact methodology", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was a fairly straightforward problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "im running out of time so i want to do <expression> thats not too complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see <expression> actually let me do this in the next problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to rush these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will continue this in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "this time we started solving differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> lecture of the term and i have yet to solve a single differential equation in this class", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that will be rectified from now until the end of the term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does such an equation look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill find some function of <expression> plus some other function of <expression>  yet another function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "obviously the <expression> doesnt have the same status here that <expression> does so <expression> is extremely limited in how it can appear in the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> can be pretty much arbitrary in those places", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the equation we are talking about and ill put it up", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the <expression> version of it and well call them purple", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why is that called the linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "the word linear is a very heavily used word in mathematics science and engineering", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is not a variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you will learn in a certain sense it helps to think of it as <expression> not right now perhaps but think of it as linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "the most closely analogous thing would be a linear equation a real linear equation the kind you studied in high school which would look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would have <expression> variables and i guess constant coefficients  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats a linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the sense in which this is linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "its linear in <expression> and <expression> which are the analogs of the variables <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a little bit of terminology if <equation> its called homogeneous the same way this equation is called homogeneous as you know from <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> if the right hand side is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6081, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so <expression> i should write here but i wont", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats called homogeneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is a common form for the equation but its not what its called standard form", "entities": []}
{"text": "the standard form for the equation and since this is going to be a prime course of confusion which is probably completely correct but a prime source of confusion is what i meant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can always convert that to a standard form by simply dividing by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6086, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "and if i do that the equation will look like <expression> plus now its common to not call it <expression> anymore the coefficient because its really <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore its common to adopt yet a new letter for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the standard <expression> that many people use is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "we needed a letter for that too", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> but well call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i talk about the standard linear form for a linear <expression> order equation its absolutely that that im talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you immediately see that there is a potential for confusion here because what did i call the standard form for a <expression> order equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to say not this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the standard <expression> order form what would that be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it would be <expression>  and everything else on the left hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i turn this into the standard <expression> order form it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course nobody would write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i explicitly want to say that this is a form which i will never use for this equation although half the books of the world do", "entities": []}
{"text": "in short this poor little <expression> order equation belongs to <expression> ethnic groups", "entities": []}
{"text": "its both a <expression> order equation and therefore its standard form should be written this way but its also a linear equation and therefore its standard form should be used this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it has to decide and i have decided for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is above all a linear equation not just a <expression> order equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this course this will always be the standard form", "entities": []}
{"text": "now well what on earth is the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont do it that way the difference is entirely in the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you get the sign of <expression> wrong in the answers it is just a disaster from that point on", "entities": []}
{"text": "a trivial little change of sign in the answer produces solutions and functions which have totally different behavior", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you are going to be really lost in this course", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should draw a line through it to indicate please dont pay any attention to this whatsoever except that we are not going to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay well whats so important about this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well number <expression> it can always be solved", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a very very big thing in differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its also the equation which arises in a variety of models", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im just going to list a few of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the mixing model which is hardly less important", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words its almost as important", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have that in your problem set", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there are other slightly less important models", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is the model of radioactive decay", "entities": []}
{"text": "a classic example is the motion of a rocket being fired off etc", "entities": []}
{"text": " etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "now today i have to pick a model", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be todays model", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its on the problem sets", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is not going to be the only lecture on the linear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we cant do everything today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets talk about the temperature concentration model except im going to change its name", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to change its name to the conduction diffusion model", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill put conduction over there and diffusion over here lets say since as you will see the similarities they are practically the same model", "entities": []}
{"text": "apply the chain rule to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6124, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"id": 6125, "label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so now lets plug in all of our numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "again the other theme is you dont plug in numbers fixed numbers until everything has stopped moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "at this point weve already calculated our rates of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i can put in the numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6127, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "cancel out <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6129, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6131, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "so lets try to write this as a so lets see if i write this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just rewrote it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i wrote this as <expression> that becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i add a <expression> i have to also subtract a <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "i cant just add <expression> arbitrarily to things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i add <expression> i have to subtract a <expression> to cancel out with that <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6142, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}, {"id": 6143, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}, {"id": 6144, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so i really havent changed this at all i just rewrote it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this now i can rewrite this term right here as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this becomes plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6147, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "thats this term right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6149, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so i could rewrite my whole <expression> is now  <expression> plus <expression> <expression> over this thing <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6156, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 6157, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 66}, {"id": 6158, "label": "command", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "now i already said i know what the inverse laplace transform of this thing is", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i just have to figure out what the inverse laplace transform of this thing is", "entities": []}
{"text": "of this let me pick a nice color of this blue thing in the blue box and then i can express it as a convolution integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could just do it right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write that down <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6163, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "and now the convolution theorem tells us that this is going to be  the inverse laplace transform of this <expression> term in the product", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not too different", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i just said confused me a bit so i dont want to confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think you get the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "i recognize these independently", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can independently take the inverse of each of these things so the inverse laplace transform of their products is going to be the convolution of each of their inverse transforms", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats this over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i had this in the beginning of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "the inverse laplace transform of this right here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were going to convolute that with the inverse laplace transform of this right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do a little bit of work on the side just to make sure we get this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the laplace transform of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that will be  <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6173, "label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "we essentially shifted it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we have something that looks very similar to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we just set our <expression> to be  <expression> here our <equation> then it fits this pattern", "entities": [{"id": 6178, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the solution to our differential equation even though its not in a pleasant form to look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can if we want express it as an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not going to actually solve the integral in this problem because it gets hairy and its not even clear that well i wont even attempt to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i just want to get into a form and from there its just integral calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "or maybe a computer", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the convolution of these <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i could actually switch and i havent shown you this but we can switch the order either way but actually let me just do it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could write this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> way that if i wanted to express the solution of this differential equations integral i could write it like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it actually should be kind of obvious to you that this could go either way", "entities": []}
{"text": "because when it was a product up here obviously order does not matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could write this term <expression> or i could write that term <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so regardless of which term is written <expression> the same principle would apply", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill formally prove it in a future video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could have also done it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could have written this expression as <expression> <expression> convoluted with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that would be  the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are equivalent", "entities": []}
{"text": "either of these would be an acceptable answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and normally on a test like this the teacher wont expect you to actually evaluate these integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "the teacher will just say get it into an integral just to kind of see whether you know how to convolute things and get your solution to the differential equation at least into this form because from here it really is just i wont say basic calculus but its nondifferential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully this <expression> example with the convolution to solve an inverse transform clarified things up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were ready to begin lecture <expression> and what im going to begin with is by finishing up some things from last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "well talk about approximations and i want to fill in a number of comments and get you a little bit more oriented in the point of view that im trying to express about approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all i want to remind you of the actual applied example that i wrote down last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was this business here", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was something from special relativity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the approximation that we used was the linear approximation with a <expression> power that comes out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to reiterate why this is a useful way of thinking of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why this is that this comes up in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "why this is maybe more important than everything that ive taught you about technically so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you work that out this is approximately the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is this saying", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is saying that if you have this satellite which is going at speed <expression> and little <expression> is the speed of light then the change in the watch down here on earth relative to the time on the satellite is going to be proportional to this ratio here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so physically this makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is time divided by time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is velocity squared divided by velocity squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in each case the units divide out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a dimensionless quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a dimensionless quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the only point here that were trying to make is just this notion of proportionality", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to write this down", "entities": []}
{"text": "just in summary", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the error fraction if you like which is sort of the number of significant digits that we have in our measurement is proportional in this case to this quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens to be proportional to this quantity here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the factor is happens to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these proportionality factors are what were looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "their rates of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "their rates of change of something with respect to something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "now on your homework you have something rather similar to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the speed of the pitch is changing depending on how high the mound is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the point here is that thats approximately proportional to the change in the height of the mound", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what youre trying to figure out is what the constant of proportionality is", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what youre aiming for in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a linear relationship approximately to all intents and purposes this is an equality", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the lower order terms are unimportant for the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "just as over here this function is a little bit complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "this function is a little more simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the purposes of this problem they are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the errors are negligible for the particular problem that were working on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we might as well work with the simpler relationship", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly over here so you could do this with in this case with square roots its not so hard here with reciprocals of square roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also not terribly hard to do it numerically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason why were not doing it numerically is that as i say this is something that happens all across engineering", "entities": []}
{"text": "people are looking for these linear relationships between the change in some input and the change in the output", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case the design of the satellite its very important", "entities": []}
{"text": "the speed actually isnt just <expression> speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its the relative speed of u to the satellite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might be it depends on your angle of sight with the satellite what the speed is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it varies quite a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you really need this rule of thumb", "entities": []}
{"text": "then there are all kinds of other considerations in this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "like for example theres the fact that were sitting on earth and so were rotating around on whats called a noninertial frame", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the question of that acceleration", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the question that the gravity that i experience here on earth is not the same as up at the satellite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that also creates a difference in time as a result of general relativity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all of these considerations come down to formulas which are this complicated or maybe a tiny bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "not really that much", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then people simplify them enormously to these very simpleminded rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they dont keep track of whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to design the system you must make these simplifications otherwise you cant even think about whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "this comes up in everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "in weather forecasting economic forecasting", "entities": []}
{"text": "figuring out whether theres going to be an asteroid thats going to hit the earth", "entities": []}
{"text": "every single <expression> of these things involves dozens of these considerations", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok there was a question that i saw here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "basically any problem where you have a derivative the rate of change also depends upon what the base point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this varies a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact thats sort of a <expression> order effect", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does change the constant of proportionality", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a rate of change at a different base point", "entities": []}
{"text": "which were considering fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you actually do the computations what you discover is that it doesnt make that much difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "to the a", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats something that you get from experience", "entities": []}
{"text": "that it turns out which things matter and which things dont", "entities": []}
{"text": "and yet again thats exactly the same sort of consideration but at the next order of what im talking about here is", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to have enough experience with numbers to know that if you take if you vary something a little bit its not going to change the answer that youre looking for very much", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly the point that im making", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i cant make them all at once all such points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my pitch for understanding things from this point of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to go on now to quadratic approximations which are a little more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we talked a little bit about this last time but i didnt finish", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to finish this up", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats something that you really need to get a little experience with", "entities": []}
{"text": "in economics i told you they use logarithms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a mess", "entities": []}
{"text": "and people dont do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they stick with the quadratic ones typically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the basic formula here and im going to take the base point to be <expression> is that <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the linear part", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus this extra term", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is supposed to work for <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it shows in the base point as simply as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres more or less where we left off last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> thing that i said i was going to explain which i will now is why its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need to know that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets work that out here <expression> of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just going to do it by example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you like the answer is just well what happens when you have a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "a parabolas a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "it had better its quadratic approximation had better be itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "its got to be the best <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its got to be itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this formula if its going to work has to work on the nose", "entities": []}
{"text": "for quadratic functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i differentiate i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i differentiate a <expression> time i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets plug it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can recover what is it that we want to recover", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to recover these numbers <expression> <expression> and <expression> using the derivatives evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its pretty easy actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats on the nose", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you plug in <equation><equation>here these terms drop out and you get a", "entities": [{"id": 6247, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and now <expression> whoops that was wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i wrote <expression> but what i meant was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets back up", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> so if i plug in <equation> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6256, "label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "now <expression> thats this next formula here <expression> i plug in <expression> here and i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats also good", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly what the linear approximation is supposed to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now you notice <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to recover <expression> i better take half of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the reason", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres no chance that any other formula could work", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> does", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the explanation for the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i remind you that i had a collection of basic formulas written on the board", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to just make sure we know all of them again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of all there was <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those were <expression> that i mentioned last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again this is all for <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all for <expression> near <expression> only", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are wildly wrong far away but near <expression> theyre nice good quadratic approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the other <expression> approximations that i want to mention are the logarithm and we use the base point shifted", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can put it at <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression>  sorry this is an approximately  sign there", "entities": []}
{"text": "turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the last <expression> is <expression> <expression> which turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now eventually your mind will converge on all of these and youll find them relatively easy to memorize", "entities": []}
{"text": "but itll take some getting used to", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im not claiming that you should recognize them and understand them all now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to put a giant box around this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question was you get all of these if you use that equation there", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly what are you going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i already did it actually for these <expression> last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i didnt do it yet for these <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i will do it in about <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well maybe <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> i want to explain just a few things about these", "entities": []}
{"text": "they all follow from the basic formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact that <expression> deserves a pink box too doesnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression>s pretty important", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe even some little sparkles", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats pretty important", "entities": []}
{"text": "almost as important as the more basic <expression> without this term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now let me just tell you a little bit more about the significance", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is just to reinforce something that weve already done", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its closely related to what youre doing on your problem set", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its worth your while to recall this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres this expression that we were dealing with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we talked about it in lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what we showed in lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way that we did that was we took the logarithm and we wrote it as <expression> times sorry the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6297, "label": "command", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "and then we evaluated the limit of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to do this limit again using linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "to show you how easy it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you just remember the linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well explain where the quadratic approximation comes in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that this is approximately  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just this linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did i use here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6302, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "thats what i used in this approximation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the linear approximation to the natural logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this number is relatively easy to evaluate", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know how to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same well so where does this work", "entities": []}
{"text": "this works where this thing is near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is when <expression> is going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this thing is working only when <expression> is going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what its really saying this approximation formula its really saying that as we go to <expression> in <expression> this thing is going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what its saying", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the substance there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats how we want to use it in many instances", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to evaluate limits", "entities": []}
{"text": "we also want to realize that its nearby when <expression> is pretty large like <expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so thats the idea of the linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you want to get the rate of convergence here so the rate of whats called convergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "so convergence means how fast this is going towards that", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i have to do is take the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to take ln ak and i have to subtract <expression> from it", "entities": [{"id": 6317, "label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "and i know that this is going to <expression> and the question is how big is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want it to be very small", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer were going to get so the answer just uses the quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i just have a little bit more detail then this expression here in other words i have the next higher order term", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is like <expression> this is like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i can understand how big the difference is between the expression that ive got and its limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats whats on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is on your problem set", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so that is more or less an explanation for <expression> of the things that quadratic approximations are good for", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to give you <expression> more illustration", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> more illustration", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well actually check these formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is in real life when youre faced with a problem like this where some satellite is orbiting and you want to know the effects of gravity or something like that nobody is going to tell you anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not even going to tell you whether a linear approximation is relevant or a quadratic or anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre on your own", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i give you a question at least for right now im always going to tell you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as time goes on id like you to get used to when its enough to get away with a linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you should only use a quadratic approximation if somebody forces you to", "entities": []}
{"text": "you should always start trying with a linear <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the quadratic ones are much more complicated as youll see in this next example", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the example that i want to use is youre going to be stuck with it because im asking for the quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "to what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is the same function that we used in the last lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this was it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so unfortunately i stuck it in the wrong place to be able to fit this very long formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to switch it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to write it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to just do the approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to say quadratic in parentheses", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well say <expression> near <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6331, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so thats what i want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres what i have to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have to write in the quadratic approximation for <expression> and im going to use this formula right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other factor im going to have to use this formula down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the <expression> term and this is the <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to do something which is the only good thing about quadratic approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre messy theyre long theres nothing particularly good about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there is <expression> good thing about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that you always get to ignore the higher order terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so even though this looks like a very ugly multiplication i can do it in my head", "entities": []}
{"text": "just watching it", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i get a <expression> im forced with that term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i get the cross terms which are linear which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already did that when we calculated the linear approximation so thats this times the <expression> and this times that <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6344, "label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 115}, {"id": 6345, "label": "command", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "and now i have <expression> crossterms which are quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6350, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres this term multiplying the <expression> thats plus <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6354, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 65}, {"id": 6355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "multiplying <expression> and that is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6359, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so the great thing is we drop <expression> etc", "entities": [{"id": 6361, "label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "and you work it out as im doing it now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i did is i multiplied <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6364, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "im using the distributive law here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i multiplied this <expression> by this <expression> that was that term", "entities": [{"id": 6368, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "i multiplied this by this thats that term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i multiplied this by this", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <expression> terms that gave me an <expression> and a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to stop at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the point is its just all the rest of the terms that come up", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have to do the higher ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question way back here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so somebody can check my arithmetic too", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if heres about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres something which is on the order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the point is that im not claiming that i have an exact answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to drop things of that order of magnitude", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im saving everything up to <expression> decimal places", "entities": []}
{"text": "im throwing away things which are <expression> decimal places out", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that answer your question", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the situation and now you can combine the terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its not very impressive here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  <expression> maybe <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a <expression> here sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the linear approximation we got last time and heres the extra information that we got from this calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is this <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "right you have to accept that theres a certain degree of complexity to this problem and the answer is sufficiently complicated so it cant be less arithmetic because we get this peculiar <expression> there right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of the things to realize is that these kinds of problems because they involve many many terms are always going to involve a little bit of complicated arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "did the ones in the left column", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets carry that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as someone just pointed out it all comes from this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just check it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well start with the ln function", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the function <expression> and then <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> so this is <expression> this is <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have to plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6400, "label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so at <equation> this is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im getting <expression> here i plug in <expression> and i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i plug in <expression> and i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6410, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so now i go and i look up at that formula which is way in that upper corner there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i see that the coefficient on the constant is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the coefficient on <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other coefficient the very last <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the formula theres a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its half of whatever i get for this <expression> derivative at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the approximation formula which is way up in that corner there", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly if i do it for <expression> i have to differentiate that i get <expression> and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here are the derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if i evaluate them at <expression> i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i plug in <equation> and i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6430, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so again the pattern is right above it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is there the <expression> is there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then instead of <expression> i have half that", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the coefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are just examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "obviously if we had a more complicated functional we might carry this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as a practical matter we try to stick with the ones in the pink box and just use algebra to get other formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to shift gears now and treat the subject that was supposed to be this lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were not quite caught up but we will try to do our best to do as much as we can today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next topic is curve sketching", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so lets get started with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now happily in this subject there are more pictures and its a little bit more geometric", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres relatively little computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets hope we can do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to so here we go well start with curve sketching", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah there are certain kinds of things which i cant spell", "entities": []}
{"text": "but alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "sketching", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres our goal", "entities": []}
{"text": "our goal is to draw the graph of <expression> using <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6437, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "whether theyre positive or negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the goal here", "entities": []}
{"text": "however there is a big warning that i want to give you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is <expression> that unfortunately i now have to make you unlearn especially those that you that have actually had a little bit of calculus before i want to make you unlearn some of your instincts that you developed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this will be harder for those of you who have actually done this before", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for the rest of you it will be relatively easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is dont abandon your precalculus skills", "entities": []}
{"text": "and common sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a great deal of common sense in this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it actually trumps some of the calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "the calculus just fills in what you didnt quite know yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will try to illustrate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and because were running a bit late i wont get to the some of the main punchlines until next lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want you to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for now im just going to tell you about the general principles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the process im going to introduce the terminology", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the words that we need to use to describe what is that were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres also a certain amount of carelessness with that in many of the treatments that youll see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a lot of hastiness", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just be a little patient and we will do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> principle is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a straightforward idea and its closely related to this tangent line approximation or the linear approximation that i just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can just imagine", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the tangent line heres the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if the tangent line is pointing up then the function is also going up too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats all thats going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the basic idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the <expression> step is also fairly straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have <expression> as positive then that means that <expression> is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same principle applied <expression> step up", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if <expression> is positive that means its the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the same principle just repeated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i just want to draw a picture of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres a picture of it i claim", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it looks like somethings going down", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i did that on purpose", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there is something thats increasing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the slope is very steep negative here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its less steep negative over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the slope which is some negative number say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its getting less negative and maybe eventually itll curve up the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a picture of what im talking about here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what it means to say that <expression> is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope is getting larger", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way to describe a curve like this is that its concave", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is concave up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly <expression> negative is going to be the same thing as <expression> concave or implies <expression> concave down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those are the ways in which derivatives will help us qualitatively to draw graphs", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as i said before we still have to use a little bit of common sense when we draw the graphs", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are just the additional bits of help that we have from calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "in drawing pictures", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to go through <expression> example to introduce all the notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then eventually so probably at the beginning of next time ill give you a systematic strategy thats going to work when what im describing now goes wrong or a little bit wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets begin with a straightforward example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> example that ill give you is the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just as i said to be able to introduce all the notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you differentiate it you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can factor that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i can decide whether the derivative is positive or negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "easily enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a positive number and <expression> is a positive number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this range <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing is so <expression> is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly in the other ranges if <expression> is very very large this becomes if it crosses <expression> in fact this becomes this factor becomes negative and this <expression> stays positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <expression> is decreasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same thing goes for the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "when its less than <expression> that also works this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "because when its less than <expression> this number factors positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the other <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in both of these cases we get that its decreasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres the schematic picture of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres <expression> heres <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to go down up down", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill just leave it alone like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the kind of information we can get right off the bat", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you notice immediately that its very important from the features of the function the sort of key features of the function that we see here are these <expression> places", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill even mark them in a like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these things are turning points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are they", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theyre just the points where the derivative changes sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "where its negative here and its positive there so there it must be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a definition and this is the most important definition in this subject which is that is if <expression> we call <expression> a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "the word turning point is not used just because in fact it doesnt have to turn around at those points", "entities": []}
{"text": "but certainly if it turns around then this will happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we also have another notation which is the number <expression> which is <expression> is called a critical value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the key numbers that were going to have to work out in order to understand what the function looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do is just plot them", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to plot the critical points and the values", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we found the critical points relatively easily", "entities": []}
{"text": "i didnt write it down here but its pretty obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you set <equation> that implies that <equation> which implies that <expression> is or <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6486, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so those are known as the critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to get the critical values here i have to plug in <expression> for instance the function is <expression> so theres this <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6491, "label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "and <expression> which is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i can plot the function here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the point <expression> and heres up here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is  whoops which <expression> is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> so its down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then over here i have the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright now what information do i get from  so ive now plotted <expression> i claim very interesting points", "entities": []}
{"text": "what information do i get from this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is i know something very nearby", "entities": []}
{"text": "because ive already checked that the thing is coming down from the left and coming back up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so it must be shaped like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the tangent line is <expression> its going to be level there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly over here its going to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what we know so far based on what weve computed", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is calculus its not called a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a very important point too", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will be discussing those kinds of points", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are much more dramatic instances of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats part of what were going to say", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i just want to save that alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will be discussing", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is that i actually did not use the <expression> derivative yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i used is another piece of information", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used the information that i derived over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression> is positive where <expression> is positive and where its negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i know is that the graph is going down to the left of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going up to the right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going up here and its going down there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did not use the <expression> derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used the <expression> derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok but i didnt just use the fact that there was a turning point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually i was using the fact that it was a turning point", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wasnt using the fact that it had the <expression> derivative though", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "for now", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can also see it by the <expression> derivative as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the next thing that id like to do i need to finish off this graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just want to do it a little bit carefully here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the order that is reasonable", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you might happen to notice and theres nothing wrong with this so lets even fill in a guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order to fill in a guess though and have it be even vaguely right i do have to notice that this thing crosses this function crosses the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "the function <equation> happens also have the property that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again common sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre allowed to use your common sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre allowed to notice a value of the function and put it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres nothing wrong with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you happen to have such a value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we can guess what our function is going to look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to maybe come down like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "come up like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and come down like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "that could be what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you know another possibility is it sort of comes along here and goes out that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "comes along here and goes out that way who knows", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens by the way that its an odd function", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are all odd powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually its symmetric on the right half and the left half", "entities": []}
{"text": "and crosses at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so everything that we do on the right is going to be the same as what happens on the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats another piece of common sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "you want to make use of that as much as possible whenever youre drawing anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont want to throw out information", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this function happens to be odd", "entities": []}
{"text": "odd and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im considering those to be kinds of precalculus skills that i want you to use as much as you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres the <expression> feature which is unfortunately ignored in most discussions of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its strange because nowadays we have graphing things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its really the only part of the exercise that you couldnt do at least on this relatively simpleminded level with a graphing calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is what i would call the ends of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens off the screen is the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that basically is the theoretical part of the problem that you have to address", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can program this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can draw all the pictures that you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what you wont see is whats off the screen", "entities": []}
{"text": "you need to know something to figure out whats off the screen", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case im talking about whats off the screen going to the right or going to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets check the ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here lets just take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have the function <expression> which is sorry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is a precalculus sort of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were imagining now lets just do <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens here", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> is gigantic this term is completely negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it just behaves like <expression> which goes to <expression> as <expression> goes to plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly <expression> goes to <expression> if <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets have we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i guess we can just say <equation> if we didnt want to write it with the function notation", "entities": [{"id": 6536, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and thats all fair and well and this works out well", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a separable differential equation and we can integrate things quite easily", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as you will see as you go further in the world of differential equations most differential equations are not so easy to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact many of them are impossible to solve using analytic methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so given that what do you do", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve nicely described some phenomena modeled some phenomena using the differential equations but if you cant solve it analytically do you just give up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer to that question is no", "entities": []}
{"text": "you do not just give up because we now have computers and computers are really good at numerical methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "numerical methods for approximating and giving us a sense of what the solution to a differential equation might look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in this video we can explore <expression> of the most straightforward numerical methods for approximating a particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we do is so im gonna draw a little table here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a little table here", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let give myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "im gonna do it over here on the left hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "a little table", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could set up a table like this to create a slope field", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could just pick all the", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were gonna do something kind of related but instead of trying to construct a slope field were gonna start with this initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6548, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "so were gonna start with <equation> and let me do this in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna start with <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that point right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were gonna say well okay what is the derivative at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know the derivative at any point thats for any solution to this differential equation the derivative is going to be  the <expression> value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case the derivative is going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in general if the derivative just like what we saw in the case of slope fields as long as the derivative is expressed as a function of <expression> and <expression> then you can figure out what the slope of the tangent line will be at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you say okay theres a slope of <expression> at that point so i can depict it like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and instead of just keep doing that with a bunch of points well say okay well lets just", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the slope is changing or its probably changing for most cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just assume its fixed until our next <expression> and then use that assumption to estimate what the next <expression> would be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what am i talking about here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i talk about the next <expression> were talking about well lets just step", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just say for the sake of simplicity were gonna have a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were gonna step from <equation> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna now step from that to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were now gonna go to", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually i may not use that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used that yellow color already for the actual graph or for the actual <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6580, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "our <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve just added <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we can do in our little approximation scheme here is well lets just assume that that slope was constant over that interval", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where does that get us to", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then <expression> is going to increase by <expression> and is going to get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we see that point right over there and you already might see where this is going", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if this were actually a point on the curve on the solution and if it was satisfying this what would then the derivative be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the derivative  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope of the tangent line is going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case the slope of the tangent line is now going to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we could depict that", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me depict that in magenta here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its gonna look", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the slope of the tangent line there is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what does that tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if we step by our <expression> more", "entities": []}
{"text": "set <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6602, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "what should the corresponding <expression> be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for every <expression> that we increase in the <expression> direction we should increase <expression> in the <expression> direction because the slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the very next <expression> should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could imagine we have now kind of had a constant slope when we get to that point right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can do the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if we assume <expression> <expression> based on the differential equation it has to be  <expression> okay the slope of the tangent line there is going to be the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if we step our <expression> up by <expression> if we increment our <expression> by <expression> again once again we just decided to increment by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could have incremented by <expression> we could have incremented by", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could guess which <expression>s going to give you a more accurate result", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we step up by <expression> now and our slope is <expression> well were gonna increase by", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we increase <expression> by <expression> were gonna increase <expression> by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are going to get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we are at the point <expression> comma <expression> which is right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so for this next stretch the next stretch is going to look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you can see just by doing this we havent been able to approximate what the particular solution looks like and you might say hey so how do we know thats not so good of an approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": " and my reply to you is well yeah i mean depends on what your goals are", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i did this by hand", "entities": []}
{"text": "i didnt even do this using a computer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and because i wanted to do it by hand i took fairly large <expression> steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i wanted a better approximation i could have lowered the <expression> and lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take another scenario", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another scenario where instead of <equation> lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6638, "label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "so once again <expression> <expression> and the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets say i want to take", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know this <expression> point", "entities": []}
{"text": "were given this initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "when the <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> and so the slope of the tangent line is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then if were incrementing by <expression> so then when <expression> is ill just write it as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is our new <expression> going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well were gonna assume that our slope from this to this is this slope right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our slope is <expression> so if we increase <expression> by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get to that point right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually youre having trouble seeing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this stuff right over here is this point right over here and now our new slope is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is going to look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is going to look like actually not quite that steep", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to overstate how good an approximation is and its starting to get a little bit messy but its gonna look something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what you would see if you kept doing this process so if your slope is now <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> when you increment <expression> by another <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> where you get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now if you increment by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and your slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> your <expression> is going to increment by half of that by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and so youre gonna get to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now you get to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is this point right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again this is a better approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember in the original <expression> y of <expression> you know should be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> on and on and on and on and on", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in this <expression> <expression> got us to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this <expression> <expression> got us to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again closer to the actual reality closer to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of stepping by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> if we stepped by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we would get even closer", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we stepped by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we would get even closer and closer and closer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a bunch of interesting things here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually how most differential equations or techniques that are derived from this or that are based on numerical methods similar to this are how most differential equations gets solved", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know its not the exact same solution or the same method that the idea that most differential equations are actually solved or i guess you can say simulated with a numerical method because most of them actually cannot be solved in analytical form", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you might be saying hey well what method is this <expression> right over here called", "entities": []}
{"text": " well this right over here is called eulers", "entities": []}
{"text": "eulers method after the famous leonhard euler", "entities": []}
{"text": "eulers method", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hopefully you found that exciting", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i introduce you to the concept of exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its just another method for solving a certain type of differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "before i show you what an exact equation is im just going to give you a little bit of the building blocks just so that when i later prove it or at least give you the intuition behind it it doesnt seem like its coming out of the blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i had some function of <expression> and <expression> and well call it <expression> just because thats what people tend to use for these exact equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre probably not familiar with taking the chain rule onto partial derivatives but ill show it to you now and ill give you a little intuition although i wont prove it", "entities": []}
{"text": "undo", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could also write this as <expression> as <expression> and <expression> which is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could write it just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are just <expression> different ways of writing the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i wont prove it but ill give you the intuition right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is should make a little bit of intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if these canceled out then youd kind of have another partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you were to kind of add them up then you would get the full derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not even the intuition thats just to show you that even this should make a little bit of intuitive sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the intuition here lets just say <expression> and <expression> doesnt always have to take this form but you could use this same methodology to take <expression> to more complex notations", "entities": [{"id": 6734, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "but lets say that <expression> and i wont write that its a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6738, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "we know that its a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its  some function of <expression> well call that <expression> times some function of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6745, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and lets say theres a bunch of terms like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just defined <expression> like this just so i can give you the intuition that when i use implicit differentiation on this when i take the derivative of this with respect to <expression> i actually get something that looks just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is just the implicit differentiation that you learned or that you hopefully learned in your <expression> semester calculus course", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats  and we just do the product rule right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> expression you take the derivative of that with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just going to be <expression> function well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you add that to the derivative of the <expression> function times the <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so plus <expression> thats just the <expression> function times the derivative of the <expression> function", "entities": [{"id": 6762, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 6763, "label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "now the derivative of the <expression> function its going to be this function with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could write that as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course were doing the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might want to review the implicit differentiation videos if that seems a little bit foreign", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this right here what i just did this expression right here this is the derivative with respect to <expression> of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have <expression> terms like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we keep adding them ill do them vertically down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so plus and then you have a bunch of them and the last <expression>s going to look the same its just the nth function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> times the <expression> function <expression> plus the <expression> function <expression> times the derivative of the <expression> function", "entities": [{"id": 6778, "label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 65}, {"id": 6779, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 6780, "label": "command", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"text": "the derivative of the <expression> function with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have <expression> n terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> terms here right where each term was a <expression> times a <expression> or <expression> and then all the way to fn of <expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6792, "label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 78}, {"id": 6793, "label": "command", "start_offset": 153, "end_offset": 158}]}
{"text": "now for each of those we got <expression> of them when we did the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we group the terms so if we group all the terms that dont have a <expression> on them what do we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we add all of these i guess you could call them on the left hand side im just rearranging it all  <expression> plus <expression> <expression> all the way to <expression>e im sorry <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6802, "label": "command", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 118}]}
{"text": "thats just all of these added up plus all of these added up", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the terms that have the <expression> in them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do them in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all of these terms are going to be in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it in a different parentheses", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <expression> and ill do the <expression> later ill distribute it out", "entities": [{"id": 6806, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "plus and we have <expression> terms plus <expression> and then all of these terms are multiplied by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6810, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 6811, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 40}, {"id": 6812, "label": "command", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "now something looks interesting here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we originally defined our <expression> up here as this right here but what is this green term", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what we did is we took all of these individual terms and these green terms here are just taking the derivative with respect to just <expression> on each of these terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you take the derivative just with respect to <expression> of this then the function of <expression> is just a constant right", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you were to take just a partial derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you took the partial derivative with respect to <expression> of this term you treat a function of <expression> as a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of this would just be <expression> <expression> because <expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so forth and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of these green terms you can view as a partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just pretended like <expression> is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that same logic if you ignore this if you just look at this part right here what is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we took <expression> up here we treated the functions of <expression> as a constant and we just took the partial derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats why the primes are on all the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we multiply that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could write this this  ill do this green this green is the same thing as the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus whats this purple this part of the purple", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in a different color in magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "this right here is the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> and then times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats essentially all i wanted to show you right now in this video because i realize im almost running out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the chain rule with respect to <expression> of the variables but the <expression> variable in the function is also a function of <expression> the chain rule is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> wasnt a function of <expression> or if <expression> if it was independent of <expression> than <expression> would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this term would be <expression> and then the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> would be just the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway i want you to just keep this in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this video i didnt prove it but i hopefully gave you a little intuition if i didnt confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to use this property in the next series of videos to understand exact equations a little bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "i realize that in this video i just got as far as kind of giving you an intuition here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent told you yet what an exact equation is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation the second derivative of <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6862, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so you might say wow this is a tremendously complicated problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have the <expression> types of functions ive been exposed to i would have so many undetermined coefficients it would get really unwieldy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where you need to make a simplifying realization", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the <expression> particular solutions to the following differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then let me just write this out a couple of times <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6866, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "we know the solution to this one as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was another particular solution we found", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think it was <expression> videos ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "the particular solution was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then finally this last polynomial we could call it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the solution when that was just the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we figured out and this was in the last video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know the particular solution when <expression> on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 6871, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "we know it when just <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 6873, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "we know it just when <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 6875, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "and we know it just when <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 6877, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "first of all the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense right", "entities": []}
{"text": "because one of the particular solutions like this one when you put it on the left hand side it will just  this term", "entities": [{"id": 6878, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 91}]}
{"text": "this particular solution when you put it in the left hand side will  this term", "entities": [{"id": 6879, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "set the left hand side to  the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6882, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}, {"id": 6883, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "and then you could add the homogeneous solution to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put it in the left side and youll get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6885, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 6886, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so it wont change the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me clean up some space because i want everything to be on the board at the same time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution is going to be well i want that to be deleted", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it in baby blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation if this was a 0 on the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 6887, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 94, "end_offset": 109}]}
{"text": "and then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video where well start learning another method for solving nonhomogeneous equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the derivative of <expression> what do i get", "entities": [{"id": 6889, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 6890, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets multiply by <expression> so that we have the formula for p canonical", "entities": [{"id": 6893, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so when i exponentiate that it becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6895, "label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did we arrive at", "entities": []}
{"text": "we arrived at the van der waals equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets write both of them", "entities": [{"id": 6896, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "well let me write <expression> and this is just the definition of the transform <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6899, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "take the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6902, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 6903, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we take the derivative of this <expression> cancels out and you just get that", "entities": [{"id": 6906, "label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "and then if we make our <expression> let me pick a good color here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we make this  our <expression> whats our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6913, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets apply the integration by parts", "entities": [{"id": 6914, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 6915, "label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "so this is going to be  <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6917, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<expression> ill use this <expression> so <equation> thats our <expression> <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write this down so its <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6925, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "let me do it in that color", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just rewriting this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the <expression> term right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me make that clear", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me pick a good color here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this term right here is this term right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course im going to have to evaluate this from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write that <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6931, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "i could put a little bracket there or something but you know were going to have to evaluate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then from that were going to have to subtract the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me not forget our boundaries", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course we have our <expression> and you have a minus minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "these things become pluses", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can simplify this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when youve evaluate whats the limit of this as <expression> approaches <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> approaches <expression> this term you might say oh this becomes really big", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i went over this in the last video", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this term overpowers it because youre going to have <expression> if we assume that <expression> is greater than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <expression> is greater than <expression> this term is going to win out and go to <expression> much faster than this term is going to go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you evaluate it at <expression> when you evaluate this at <expression> youre going to get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youre going to subtract this evaluated at <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6950, "label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "this evaluated at <expression> when its evaluated at <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this becomes <expression> as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this whole term evaluated from <expression> to <expression> is all <expression> which is a nice convenient thing for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were going to have this next term right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take out the constant terms", "entities": [{"id": 6958, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "this <expression> and this <expression> are constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are constant with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this should look reasonably familiar to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "well when we have an <expression> were taking the integral from <expression> to <expression> so this whole integral  the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just that easily because this term went to <expression> weve simplified things integral right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is a nice neat simplification", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if we can use this with this information to get a generalized formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write that down <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6969, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "i could write this as <expression> which is just <expression>  <expression> where <expression> is greater than <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 6975, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "well we can just use this formula up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well t we know what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we just use this formula up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just this right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its  <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to actually write it this way <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think you already are getting the idea of whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just <expression> this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you can just get the general principle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can prove this by induction", "entities": []}
{"text": "its almost trivial based on what weve already done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets let <equation> thats a natural quantity to look at right", "entities": [{"id": 6987, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "and that is between <expression> and <expression> its just a fraction of white balls in the population", "entities": []}
{"text": "let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6991, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "thats not a random variable but thats sort of a traditional statistics notation sometimes for the population size is capital <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sample size is lowercase <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6995, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "lets say <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 6997, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so transforming from <expression> to <expression> by multiplying some function <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7001, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "we need to make some assumptions on <expression> if <expression> is a really nasty function then this may not work out very well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we multiply <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7006, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and i just have to explain the notation a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we transformed capital <expression> to capital <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a natural thing to do is to mirror that notation with the lowercase letters", "entities": []}
{"text": "we define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7010, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "so were doing the same transformation", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7012, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so all im saying to do is plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7014, "label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "<expression> is the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> viewed as a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are several variations on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular you can also do <expression> is the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just intro of calculus again but its useful to point out", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the reciprocal of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the reciprocal of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7023, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 7024, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats just the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 7025, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "remember from calculus these look like fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not actually fractions but the chain rule says they act like fractions", "entities": [{"id": 7026, "label": "method", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "thats just the chain rule", "entities": [{"id": 7027, "label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so that says we have a choice in doing this we can decide which is easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "either we could do <expression> directly or we could take <expression> and flip it", "entities": [{"id": 7030, "label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}, {"id": 7031, "label": "method", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "and then we just have to remember to write it as a function of <expression> either way", "entities": []}
{"text": "strictly increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a common mistake on this kind of problem would be to just try to blindly plug into this formula for a function like <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7034, "label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "now if <equation> is a very very nice function", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not saying thats not a nice function its a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then the negative side doesnt come into play", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont just plug into the formula all without checking the assumptions", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so lets prove this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the proof should be pretty easy just based on kind of similar calculations we did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "like in a sense this is easier than universality or things like that that weve done before", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna take the derivative thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that pretty quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets just take the derivative of both sides <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7037, "label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"id": 7038, "label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}, {"id": 7039, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "so chain rules says i can differentiate first with respect to <expression> and get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7042, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "all right so thats what we wanted to show", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a famous example one of the most widely used distributions in practice is called the log normal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7044, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so over here lets just compute the derivative <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we just need to be careful about do we multiply it by <expression> here or <expression> right", "entities": [{"id": 7048, "label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "but that says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the reciprocal of this so were gonna just put a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats gonna be the pdf", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way if you ever forget whether this is <expression> or <expression> well i mean it shouldnt take long to rederive it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you may have been taught that its not ok to separate the <expression> from the <expression> but when you go further in math then people start separating them again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as long as youre careful about what things mean it is possible to do that if you interpret it correctly but i just think of that as an amonic", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does that actually mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "enclose both sides with an absolute value symbol", "entities": [{"id": 7056, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}, {"id": 7057, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7058, "label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "all right so i just have to tell you what this thing means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>  just to write it out", "entities": [{"id": 7060, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "its a matrix of all possible partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> other calculus thing that we should discuss briefly is convolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want so lets let <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7063, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were assuming that <expression> and <expression> are independent here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its much nastier if theyre dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill replace <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7069, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the easiest way to remember this result is by thinking by analogy with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "however thats not a proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just an analogy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the new homework youll see an example where if you try to reason kind of an analogous way for a product instead of a sum well youll see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "this requires more justification", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are several ways to justify this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7071, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and once weve plugged in <equation> we can drop the condition because <expression> and <expression> are independent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now take the derivative of both sides of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "derivative with respect to <expression> and then theres a theorem that says you can swap the derivative and the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "something that you can see whether you agree with me or not but this is something that beauty is not really an adequate word for this is not something i would consider existential okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres an idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we started last week on the big topic for the rest of the semester optimization", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe can you close that door or just part way anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "great", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats perfect just like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since it was a few days ago i wanted to recap what i did in the first lecture about optimization which was to pick out the least squares problem as a beautiful model problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "we would like to get <equation> but we cant", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words right angles here mean transpose <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then tranpose <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7081, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "im going to graph <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7083, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it doesnt move", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would discover <expression>  <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i solve derivative  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lagranges brilliant idea was that now ive got a function that i can my derivatives i can take", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could set the derivatives to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7094, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "<expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7097, "label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and <expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7100, "label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "so we got now <expression> equations <expression> unknown", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of going from <expression> to <expression> weve gone from <expression> up to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i can say what this thing really the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that what im getting", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this says <expression> over <expression> and this one says <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our <expression> equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes so i will help kill these  signs and just look at oh thats a plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve got our saddle point matrix again", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the nice thing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "with right hand side set to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7116, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 7117, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "that looks like a <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this looks like <expression> a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this looks like oh wait a minute", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can live with <expression> and <expression> there but its not really what i wanted", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted the signs to you know what i want here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want the transpose of that to be here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can take its derivative and you find out that its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that lagrange multiplier thats really a key message is an important quantity in itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "here it happens to mean displacement which is obviously crucial quantity and in general it tells us the change in the minimum energy with respect to a change in the input", "entities": []}
{"text": "that sensitivitys a natural word to use for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a final word about well a near to final word about lagrange multipliers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill see you wednesday and by that time ill know more about the projects and well be moving onward with optimization", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "a lot of what youll learn in differential equations is really just different bags of tricks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this video ill show you <expression> of those tricks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its useful beyond this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its always good when if maybe <expression> day you become a mathematician or a physicist and you have an unsolved problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "some of these tricks that solved simpler problems back in your education might be a useful trick that solves some unsolved problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its good to see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if youre taking differential equations it might be on an exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its good to learn", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well learn about integrating factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say we have an equation that has this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this is my differential equation <expression> im trying to write it neatly as possible <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7137, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so especially since weve covered this in recent videos whenever you see an equation of this form where you have some function of <expression> then you have another function of <expression> and <equation> you said oh this looks like this could be an exact differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how do we test that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can take the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> and we could call this function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we set <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7146, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "and in order for this to have been an exact differential equation the partial of this with respect to <expression> would have to  the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we see here just by looking at these two they dont  each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre not ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at least superficially the way we looked at it just now this is not an exact differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what if there were some factor or i guess some function that we could multiply both sides of this equation by that would make it an exact differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets call that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i want to do is i want to multiply both sides of this equation by some function <expression> and then see if i can solve for that function <expression> that would make it exact", "entities": [{"id": 7152, "label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 42}, {"id": 7153, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "so lets try to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets multiply both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7155, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"id": 7157, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and just as a simplification <expression> could be a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be a function of just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be function of just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill assume its just a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could assume its just a function of <expression> and try to solve it", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could just assume its a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you assume its a function of <expression> and <expression> it becomes a lot harder to solve for", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that doesnt mean that there isnt <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7173, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "and i want to multiply it by both of these equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats <expression> times any function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its just going to be <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i did multiply the right hand side times <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7184, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7185, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and remember what were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is when we multiply it the goal is after multiplying both sides of the equation by it we should have an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now if we consider this whole thing our new <expression> the <expression> should be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if were taking the partial with respect to <expression> here <expression> which is only a function of <expression> its not a function of <expression> its just a constant term right", "entities": []}
{"text": "we take a partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just a constant or a function of <expression> can be viewed just as a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of this with respect to <expression> is going to be  <expression> you could just say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well here well use the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well take the derivative of the first expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is no longer a constant anymore since were taking the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the greek letter", "entities": []}
{"text": "its for the muh sound but it looks a lot like a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the product rule <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "times the derivative of the <expression> expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7217, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "so times ran out of space on that line <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now for this new equation where i multiplied both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7220, "label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 48}, {"id": 7221, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "in order for this to be exact these two things have to be  each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just remember the big picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "were kind of saying this is going to be exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were going to try to solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if we can do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see on this side we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets subtract this expression from both sides", "entities": [{"id": 7224, "label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}, {"id": 7225, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see a lot of these differential equation problems that get kind of hairy", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre really just a lot of algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that  what do we have left", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill write it in yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7228, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "that  im going to run out of space", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do it a little bit lower", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  just this term right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see if we factor out a <expression> here we get <equation> the <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7236, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "now we can simplify this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets simplify <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7238, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so we set that to <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7240, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "<expression> so <expression>  and im just going to simplify this side a little bit  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets factor out an <expression> here", "entities": [{"id": 7248, "label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and the reason why im doing that is because it seems like if i factor out an <expression> here ill get an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why i did it and i have this <expression> on both sides equation which i will now divide both sides by", "entities": [{"id": 7254, "label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 97}, {"id": 7255, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 108}]}
{"text": "so if you divide both sides by <expression> we could maybe assume that its not <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7258, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}, {"id": 7259, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "that simplifies things pretty dramatically", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now just the way my brain works i like to rewrite this expression just in our operator form where instead of writing it <expression> we could write that as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could write <equation> the <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7266, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and this is actually a separable differential equation in and of itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of a subdifferential equation to solve our broader one", "entities": []}
{"text": "were just trying to figure out the integrating factor right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets divide both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7268, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}, {"id": 7269, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so we get <expression> this is just a separable equation now  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then lets divide both sides by <expression> and we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7274, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}, {"id": 7277, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "im actually going to go horizontal right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "multiply both sides by <expression> you get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7283, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"id": 7284, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "now you could integrate both sides of this and youll get the <equation> et cetera et cetera", "entities": [{"id": 7286, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}, {"id": 7287, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "but it should be pretty clear from this that <equation> or <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre identical", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you look at both sides of this equation there you can just change <expression> for <expression> and it becomes the other side", "entities": [{"id": 7292, "label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "so this is obviously telling us that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have our integrating factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you want you can take the antiderivative of both sides with the natural logs and all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll get the same answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is just by looking at it by inspection you know that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because both sides of this equation are completely the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway we now have our integrating factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i am running out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the next video were now going to use this integrating factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "multiply it times our original differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "make it exact", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then solve it as an exact equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i plug <equation> <equation> and that will give me <equation> <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7300, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "what is the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is just <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the velocity vector is <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have to continue the calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i will write <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7312, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example let me try to convince you of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example say i chose to instead go like this and then around like that first i wouldnt do any work because here the force is perpendicular to my motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i would be going against the force all the way around", "entities": []}
{"text": "but here see i am not assuming for example that the particle is moving just based on that force", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe actually i am here to hold it in my hand and force it to go where it is going or maybe there is some rail that is taking it in that trajectory or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can really do it along any trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i wanted to if i knew that was the case i could try to find the trajectory based on what the force is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that is not what we are doing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to make sense of what you asked just a few minutes ago what can we do directly with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean when i replace <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7317, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be time", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we have to express everything in terms of that <expression> parameter", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we get a usual single variable integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we evaluate things in this language", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we do it by substituting the parameter into everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "the method to evaluate is to express <expression> and <expression> in terms of a single variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then substitute that variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets for example redo the one we had up there just using these new notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will see that it is the same calculation but with different notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we are integrating is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and see if we have just this we dont know how to integrate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean well you could try to come up with negative <expression> <expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that actually doesnt make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt work", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we will do is we will actually have to express everything in terms of a same variable because it is a single integral and we should only have on variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what that variable will be well if we just do it the same way that would just be t", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we express everything in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we use the parametric equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know what to do with these two guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just differentiate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> becomes <expression> <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am just saying in a different language what i said over here with <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is the same thing but written slightly differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i am going to do it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to switch from <expression> board to the next <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i can say yes this is the integral from <expression> to <expression> of that stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can simplify it a bit and <expression> becomes <expression> and i can compute it  <expression>rd", "entities": [{"id": 7347, "label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "i have <expression> and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i plug <expression> for <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7352, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "i plug <expression> for <expression> and so on", "entities": [{"id": 7355, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "and that is the general method", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you are given a curve then you first have to figure out how do you express x and y in terms of the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you get to choose in general what parameter we use", "entities": []}
{"text": "you choose to parameterize your curve in whatever way you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can choose whichever variable you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you could get <expression> and <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you would be able to do it with a lot of trig and you would get the same answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be a harder way to get the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "what you should do in practice is use the most reasonable way to parameterize your curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you know that you have a piece of parabola <equation> there is no way you would put <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could set <equation> which is very reasonable", "entities": [{"id": 7363, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "you could even take a small shortcut and say that your variable will be just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <expression> you just keep as it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you have <expression> you set <equation> <equation> and then you will have an integral over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one is not practical", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you get to choose", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me tell you a bit more about the geometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have said here is how we compute it in general and that is the general method for computing a line integral for work", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can always do this try to find a parameter the simplest one express everything in terms of its variable and then you have an integral to compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "but sometimes you can actually save a lot of work by just thinking geometrically about what this all does", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me tell you about the geometric approach", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can write vector <equation> but that is also <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7372, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "suppose we have <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7375, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "the first thing that im going to do is im going to multiply by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7377, "label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "ok so if i multiply by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7379, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "lets think about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i multiply by <expression> on both the left and the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 7381, "label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 13}, {"id": 7383, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "then on the left side <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the right side i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres a very very substantial cancellation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we cancel out <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7387, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "and the only thing thats left is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i subtract i get <expression> on the lefthand side", "entities": [{"id": 7390, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}, {"id": 7391, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "and on the righthand side i get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7393, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can rewrite it as <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7395, "label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and so ive got my formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this reasoning has one flaw", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not complete", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this reasoning is basically correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its incomplete because it requires that <expression> exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example it doesnt make any sense in the case <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example in the case <equation> we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when we multiply through by <expression> we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7403, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "and now you see that the subtraction gives us <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats really going on in the argument in this context", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its just nonsense", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean it doesnt give us anything meaningful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this argument its great", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression> term suddenly becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7407, "label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and the antiderivative of this next term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the next term is <expression> and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words lets plug <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7411, "label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "im going to add <expression> to the right hand side", "entities": [{"id": 7418, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 7419, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "and ill plug in a <equation> over here", "entities": [{"id": 7421, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "on the other hand i can do this for each value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the interpretation of this is that its a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly this is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres really no distinction there its just i slipped it passed you", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are functions of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the notion of a power series is this idea that you put coefficients on a series but then you allow yourself the flexibility to stick powers here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly what were doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok there are other kinds of series where you stick other interesting functions in here like sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are lots of other series that people study", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are the simplest ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all those examples are extremely helpful for representing functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were only going to do this example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so here are the <expression> rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now theres only one other complication here which i have to explain to you before giving you a bunch of examples to show you that this works extremely well", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely differentiate <expression> times", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you evaluate it at <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7432, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and you divide by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7434, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and multiply by <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7436, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so lets just illustrate it <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7438, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "but now you see if i plug in <equation> i can pick off the <expression> term", "entities": [{"id": 7441, "label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and i evaluate <expression> at <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7444, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so set all of those numerators to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7446, "label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 6}, {"id": 7447, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so this will actually make it easier for you to remember rather than harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so with that ill leave the practice on differentiation for next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and good luck everybody", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill talk to you individually", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that we have passed the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see how that works", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i take some path that starts at the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i want to go along this path from the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i want to compute for the line integral along that curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i want to do it for this vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will set <equation> and also <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7450, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "<expression> becomes just <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7453, "label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "it is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "that integrates to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you prefer that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to solve the equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want a function such that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just look at one of these at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we look at this one well we know how to solve this because it is just telling us we have to integrate this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets call them <expression> and <expression> because i will have to refer to them again", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets start with equation <expression> and lets integrate with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is not quite the end to it because there is an integration constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here when i say there is an integration constant it just means the extra term does not depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is what it means to be a constant in this setting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe my constant still depends on y so it is not actually a true constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "a constant that depends on <expression> is not really a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is actually a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the good news that we have is that this function normally depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have made some progress", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have part of the answer and we have simplified the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have anything that looks like this it will satisfy the first condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we need to look at the second condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want <expression> to be that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we know what <expression> is so lets compute <expression> from this", "entities": []}
{"text": "from this i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i get if i differentiate this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would like to match this with what i had", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i match this with equation two then that will tell me what the derivative of <expression> should be", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we compare the two things there we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course the <expression> go away", "entities": []}
{"text": "that tells you <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that integrates to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this time the constant is a true constant because g did not depend on anything other than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the constant does not depend on <expression> so it is a real constant now", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we just plug <equation> back into this guy", "entities": [{"id": 7481, "label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "lets call him star", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we plug <equation> into star we get <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7484, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "lets integrate this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will get another expression for f up to a constant that depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then lets match them", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the difficulty is matching is actually quite tricky because you dont know in advance whether they will be the same expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is actually not a good way to do it because if i put sufficiently complicated trig functions in there then you might not be able to see that two terms are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "take an easy <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that here i have <expression> and here i have a <expression> then you might not actually notice that there is a difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there is no difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i am saying do it this way dont do it any other way because there is a risk of making a mistake otherwise", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean on the other hand you could start with integrating with respect to <expression> and then differentiate and match with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way here of course after we simplified there were only <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "there were no <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is kind of good news", "entities": []}
{"text": "the format is first we do everything in two variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we will do three variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what happens with more than three will be left to your imagination", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other questions about either of these methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "a quick poll", "entities": []}
{"text": "who prefers the first method", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand it does require a little bit more attention", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets move on a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me start by actually doing a small recap", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the double integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7496, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"id": 7497, "label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "weve seen various formulas for how to set up the double integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the coordinates of my vector field are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the first thing we need to do is actually a simplification", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets simplify <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7500, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so instead of proving the divergence theorem namely the equality up there im going to actually prove something easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me change <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7503, "label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "if you already have an <expression> i mean theres not much risk for confusion but still", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so were going to call <expression> the shadow of my region instead", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i cant actually set up bounds for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to just leave it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you should get <expression> back", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets take the triple integral over <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7510, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"id": 7511, "label": "method", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so that means remember <expression> is a function of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact i will plug <expression> into <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7518, "label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "ok any questions about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it looking vaguely believable", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wont be able to do anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i integrate <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7520, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and whats the range for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "how do you remember these three conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is pretty easy", "entities": []}

{"text": "that is pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do an example just to see how it goes", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way we can also think of it in terms of differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "before i do the example let me just say we have <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7549, "label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 47}]}

{"text": "the example that i promised", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course i could do again the same <expression> over there and check that it satisfies the condition but then it wouldnt be much fun", "entities": []}

{"text": "lets say <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7553, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}

{"text": "because otherwise i am going to get confused myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other one has actually more steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean of course here there are also a bit more steps because you have <expression> parts to your path instead of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are going to look at them one at a time and get partial information on the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we will compare with the others to get more information until we are completely done", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first thing we will do we know that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that should tell us something about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets just integrate that with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write integral <expression> next to that", "entities": [{"id": 7569, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}, {"id": 7570, "label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "it means that for given values of <expression> and <expression> we will get a term that does not depend on <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "that is the first step", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we need to get some information on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets integrate with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "you start with <expression> and you integrate that with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}

{"text": "you can choose whichever <expression> you prefer", "entities": []}

{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess i already asked", "entities": []}
{"text": "still no questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we define <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7598, "label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and of course nobody can remember this formula so what is the structure of this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in general if you have a complicated motion some of it might be you know there is a translation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then within that translation there is maybe expansion and rotation and sharing and everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the curl will compute how much rotation is taking place", "entities": []}
{"text": "it will tell you say that you have a very small solid i dont know like a ping pong ball in your flow and it is just going with the flow it tells you how it is going to start rotating", "entities": []}

{"text": "on thursday we will see stokes theorem which will be the last ingredient before the next exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then on friday we will review stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "now today i need to get started by finishing up what i did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely talking about numerical methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to just carry out <expression> example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i want to fill in <expression> loose end", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well talk about the unit overall", "entities": []}
{"text": "we were talking last time about numerical integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to illustrate this just with the simplest example that i can", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to look at the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which we know perfectly well already is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you punch that into your calculator youre going to get something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope i saved it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "its about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats more digits than were going to get in our discussion here", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway thats about how big this number is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the numerical integration methods will give you about as much accuracy as you can get on the function itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course some functions we may have more trouble approximating", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the function <expression> we know pretty well how to do because we know how to divide", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since the function that were integrating here is <expression> its going to be not too difficult to get some arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "nevertheless im going to do this in the simplest possible case", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely just with <expression> intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you really cant expect things to work so well with <expression> intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a pretty ridiculous approximation to your function", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you have <expression> intervals that means youre looking at the graph of this hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you have <expression> here and you have <expression> here and you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youre really only keeping track of the values at these <expression> spots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the idea that you can approximate the area just by knowing the values of <expression> places is a little bit of a stretch of the imagination", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it seems very modest but if it doesnt give you the exact answer for <equation> youve got the wrong weightings", "entities": []}
{"text": "we integrate the whole range from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the conclusion is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already know that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the problem that we want to deal with now is the problem not of a volume but an area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this looks quite different", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course the answer is going to be different", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to say <equation> which we already know is <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7625, "label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the idea here is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this number here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <equation> if we believe what we said on the last panel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that was the thing that i drew a picture of on the board", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely the graph of <expression> looked like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there was this asymptote which was the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats in that orange box there that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i draw the graph of <equation>", "entities": [{"id": 7633, "label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "this will be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "some other level", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to show you what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens is that the hump dies down a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the bump is just a little bit lower", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its going to look a little bit the same way", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its just going to be a bit smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres another slice here", "entities": []}
{"text": "like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets just substitute <equation> in", "entities": [{"id": 7636, "label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so we know what gamma is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you integrate the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7639, "label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so what is it really doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i had the following nonhomogeneous differential equation the second derivative of <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7642, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "so you might say wow this is a tremendously complicated problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have the <expression> types of functions ive been exposed to i would have so many undetermined coefficients it would get really unwieldy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where you need to make a simplifying realization", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the <expression> particular solutions to the following differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the solution to this one as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was another particular solution we found", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think it was <expression> videos ago", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we found that the particular solution in this case and this was a fairly hairy problem was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "the particular solution was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then finally this last polynomial we could call it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the solution when that was just the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we figured out and this was in the last video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know the particular solution when <expression> on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know it when just <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know it just when <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know it just when <expression> is on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all the particular solution to this nonhomogeneous equation we could just take the sum of the three particular solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense right", "entities": []}
{"text": "because one of the particular solutions like this one when you put it on the left hand side it will just  this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "this particular solution when you put it in the left hand side will  this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "set the left hand side to  the <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 7654, "label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"id": 7655, "label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and then you could add the homogeneous solution to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put it in the left side and youll get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it wont change the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you will have the most general solution because you have these two constants that you can solve for depending on your initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution to this seemingly hairy differential equation is really just the sum of these four solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me clean up some space because i want everything to be on the board at the same time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution is going to be well i want that to be deleted", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it in baby blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then add them to the general solution for the homogeneous equation if this was a 0 on the right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you get the general solution for this fairly intimidating looking second order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video where well start learning another method for solving nonhomogeneous equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what we can do is add <expression> to <expression> so now we get <expression>", "entities": [{"id": 40635, "label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 25}]}

{"text": "and then plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so its <expression> right c is one thats were approximating around", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets add that last term we calculated", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "this is over <expression> really and this is over <expression> really", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so the derivative of this function evaluated at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as we can see it approximates the function even better", "entities": []}
{"text": "even neater and if you have some spare time you might just want to keep adding terms to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think when you see me do an example youll see that its not so bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is the derivative of <expression> its <expression> right <expression> and we want to evaluate it at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 103}]}
{"text": "and so then we the line was just essentially the tangent line we only had <expression> terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do they do for us well the second term actually ensures that the derivative of this polynomial evaluated at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could almost just view this as <expression> which is a constant whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "this term would be <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually well see that theres actually a whole class of functions that the taylor polynomial if you were to take the infinite series is actually  that function at all points", "entities": []}
{"text": "but hopefully that gave you some intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the graph of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> and then plus lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know when you see the formula at first it can be kind of daunting and especially sometimes its even more daunting when someone even explains it to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets approximate i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if all of these terms werent here the polynomial would just be a constant right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right because this <expression> sorry just had some walnuts", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the first term of the polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i talk a little bit about that when i prove that <expression> to the <equation> which to me was the most amazing result in mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets add the second term to it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and i realize this is probably one of longest videos ive done", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the second derivative whats going to be the derivative of minus sine which is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats the intuition so first of all what happens to this polynomial at <expression> so whats <expression> <expression>  if <expression> everywhere where you see an x here you have to put a <expression> right so this term would be <expression> so that would go to <expression> or it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but pretty close", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets keep going", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> over they say <expression> which is just <expression> but ok ill write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hrw", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you do it around something other than <expression> its kind of the more general case and were dealing with the taylor polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "undo edit undo", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "this term would be <expression> so it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i would want to approximate it i would want to create a polynomial that can approximate the function around this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this looks really complicated but when you do some examples youll see its not so bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you put the <expression> here they drop out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that this green graph is concave downwards right which means that and so is the function at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just show you just to hit the point home", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were evaluating it at <expression> so theres actually going to be a number right so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember when we went out far to the left starting to approximate the function better around here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that <expression>  let me do it in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets not pick some number that works well with trigonometric functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you can see i just want to show you that im just typing in the actual terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what is this whats the derivative of this well we could use this is a constant term and the derivative of this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the first term was essentially well you get the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and every term you add to the taylor polynomial actually makes it so that that term derivative of the polynomial evaluated at <expression>  the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the derivative of this polynomial when you evaluate it at <expression> well when you put <expression> into this derivative function all these other terms are going to drop off and youre just left with this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets add our third term", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "the slope of the polynomial is also  the slope of the function at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> oh sorry this should be a one right i said <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next term well have to see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should have some water with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what does this second term do us because we know that if we just evaluated c", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right and then lets do one more term just for fun", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that thats my axes this is my function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so great", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats all the taylor polynomial is", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the second term made sure that at least the first derivative was the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to show you i just typed it in right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the further out you go when youre close to your point that youve picked", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already know that at least at the value of <expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets add another term", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so it would be a pretty bad approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could go on like this for infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "these other terms dont matter much right because youre doing <expression> and then <expression> et cetera et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression> im already running out of space <expression> i think at this point people just write a <expression> in parentheses of the function evaluated at  <expression> and you could just keep adding terms", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "so what does this thing look like and what im going to do is im going to show you how this polynomial develops as we add terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to approximate <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "obviously if we get far away out here this is a horrible approximation for the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a taylor polynomial says that if i have a differentiable function <expression> and i want to approximate it with a polynomial at <expression> so at some value of <equation> i want to approximate this function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 107}]}
{"text": "let me graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "and all youd be left with is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> evaluated at <expression> and just keep adding but then it will take us forever et cetera et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it didnt ignore this video", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general you could approximate a function around any value", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the third derivative plus whats the third derivative of <expression> well its the derivative of <expression> so thats plus sign", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "<expression> evaluated at <expression> whats <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were already starting to approximate this pretty well right now the third derivative of the polynomial  the third derivative of the function at the point <equation> and we havent even studied third derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "so plus <expression> evaluated at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it gives a something", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we could just keep going", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have this graphing calculator that i so this thing i got from just to give them credit its my", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we just pick we approximate the function around <equation> when we did the maclaurin series", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "im pushing 17 minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the function evaluated at <expression> is just <expression> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then were going to take the fourth derivative which is the derivative of the third derivative so the third derivative was <expression> so now were going to be <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is this is pretty neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this should be pretty neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as you can see whats neat about this taylor polynomial is its  the function at <expression> its derivative  the function at <expression> the second derivative  the function at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im even going to erase this fourth term", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and we could just keep going", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what was the second term it was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the third term makes sure that the second derivative of our polynomial at <equation>  the second derivative of the polynomial of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "its closer at least", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets add some terms", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "the last term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just the first term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i wanted just to show you one thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so this is a better approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this function is infinitely differentiable meaning that i can take the first second third fourth you know all the way to infinity derivative of this function i could construct a polynomial like this and i can just keep going by adding more and more terms so that this polynomials you know zeroth derivative which is means the function the <expression> first second third fourth all of this polynomials derivatives are going to be  the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it only starts to matter as you move really really far away from your chosen <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats kind of like the concativity of the derivative or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "just with three terms on our polynomial well actually thats the fourth term officially", "entities": []}
{"text": "this term would be <expression> it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we did the videos on approximating functions with polynomials we used maclaurin series which is actually a special case of the taylor polynomial or the taylor theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could pick some value <expression> some value <equation> maybe its right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its getting a little bit better", "entities": []}
{"text": "so over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "were getting a little bit so its kind of approximating the curve here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the slope is also  the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is that let me just write the definition down and then well do a couple of examples and then well graph it to get the intuition", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 106, "end_offset": 111}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "and the taylor theorem tells us that the taylor polynomial to approximate this is and then ill give you the intuition for it in a second", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "divided by <expression> so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it might look like a function but its a function evaluated at c so its just a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you just added <expression> terms what did we say the polynomial will be  the function at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were to just to graph the first term of this polynomial what does it look like so ill just type in <expression> and graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 122, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "but let me give you the intuition of what this is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as you get further and further away these terms become more significant right as <expression> gets further and further away from <expression> and then thats where these start to play in and you see that in the approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry my brain is really i ate too many walnuts", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the particulars are always the more fun", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to approximate <expression> around <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and lets pick some arbitrary number", "entities": []}
{"text": "com", "entities": []}
{"text": "our third term i can see it its right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this might have been a little confusing for you so lets do a particular example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a pretty bad approximation but at least it  the function at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "the big picture is the whole thinking behind i guess what taylor thought of was wow", "entities": []}
{"text": "obviously though when we go further away it starts to break down again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually if we did 10 terms or if we did all of the derivatives these would start to actually  each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats c", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope i didnt confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i mean there well whats <expression> <expression>  well this is just a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to intersect this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "at least around that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "over <expression> right <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at least if we stay pretty close to our chosen c its a decent approximation for the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of this expression is <expression> and then plus the derivative of this expression and thats  what <expression> which is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all these other terms just drop out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> what was it <expression> and you dont have to worry about all of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets pick around lets say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "anyway let me graph it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "now this is neat right so the first term got us a horizontal line that just intersected the point at cosine of 1 and it was a really bad approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "then you could plus the fourth derivative of the function evaluated at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just draw a quick and dirty one and well actually draw an accurate one later", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little confusing at first because it gives you this huge formula and they give you the <expression> and youre like what is that <expression> and how do i take the derivative but when you actually try to chug through it you just have to realize oh", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it doesnt you might want to use your calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats <expression> at <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bacteria culture initially contains 100 cells", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "bacteria as a function of time is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually since just to hit another point home we could have used this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  i didnt even have to use a calculator look at that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that tells us let me side comments anyway so what was i doing oh", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you would say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there we figured out using the initial condition here we figured out i naught", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the same exact logic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats all im saying here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is the exact same phenomenon", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is also  if we look at it there <expression> to the what <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill say bacteria as a function of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you could say after an hour the population has increased to whatever <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just a constant times t so its just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually that is a simpler bacterial equation than this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> so if i raise <expression> to that exponent i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where <expression> is kind of our compounding rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of both sides of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might want to review all the logarithms if you found that a little confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that makes part b even easier to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think we can erase all of this because weve written down our equation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then they want to know what the rate of growth is after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> of well let me do it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were making some progress", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> must  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what are they asking find the rate of growth after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hopefully i didnt further confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it says a bacteria culture initially contains 100 cells and grows at a rate proportional to its size", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if we just knew <expression> then we would have done this part a find an expression for the number bacteria after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this all is actually a pretty important thing to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually we would probably want to convert backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <equation> right because <expression> is essentially saying what exponent do i have to raise <expression> to to get <expression> so if i raise <expression> to that exponent i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so to solve this so youre essentially saying log base you would essentially want to take <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you want to solve for <expression> you just divide both sides by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway ill do more of these problems because they can be a little confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could divide both sides by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just plugging into your calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how many hours does it take you just plug this in your calculator and you will get a number for the number of hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know you cant read that but well use it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that tells us that <expression> right after <expression> hour the population has increased to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is also  if we put <expression> here that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do that actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i got a little bit messier than i wanted to", "entities": []}
{"text": "after an hour the population has increased to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets figure out the number of bacteria after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could also take <expression> and divide it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it just makes things simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just have to take the derivative of the bacteria function with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we divide both sides by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it should make a little sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully that makes sense to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you know what you start with and then you have another point you can solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be probably <expression> something and so well do that later", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that if you take the natural log of this side youre just left with the exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then their final question is when will the population reach <expression> so let me see erase what we did with part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have an expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have our function now", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do that in a special color", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> right so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the same thing right and what would we would have had we would have had <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you didnt find that too confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the larger you grow youre going to grow by an absolute value more than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well how can we figure out <expression> well they give us another data point", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that the bacteria as a function of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will do this was actually exponential growth", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  what so whats the derivative of lets just do the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the derivative at any time t", "entities": []}
{"text": "divide both sides by <expression> and you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to solve for <expression> we take the <expression> of both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can actually figure this out analytically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i said thats the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the amount of whatever you have as a function of time will be this type of equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now take the <expression> of both sides of this equation right so then we get what we get let me draw a divide well ill do it in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats essentially well whats this going to be this is the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its a pretty useful thing to know in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that times well e to the as we just did this in part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does that leave us so now we know the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that number we could calculate if you have a calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see what we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my question to you is first of all what is <expression> what is your initial number of bacterial cells well they tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <expression> when <equation> right and so if we substitute here <equation> this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats our function", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway this is a compound growth problem or an exponential growth problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i went over this in the exponent proper in the logarithm properties video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then they say find this is part b find the number of bacteria after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me put e to the k on this side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can well figure that out later with a calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we could rewrite the derivative as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "that at any time <expression> we can tell you how many bacteria there are", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times the derivative of <expression> to the whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "part c find the rate of growth after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know we knew that part a <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do you figure out your calculator has two bases", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats the same thing as because this expression right here is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right actually thats i should have written our original equation as that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then find the expression for the number of so essentially youd be trying to figure out the compound interest rate and all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase all this other stuff i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can erase that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you think about it what were going to do here with a bacteria its no different than what we did with compound interest when we learned about interest and the number e", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> should just be i naught", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually we could even erase all of this because weve just answered that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could rewrite this as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "e to the ln of lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "well part c is actually it was easier to keep it in this form because taking a derivative of <expression> is easier than taking a derivative of another base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we got <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have the first thing they want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know <expression> and we know <expression> so we know that the equation is so part a the equation is <expression> bacteria as a function of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "after an hour the population has increased to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in general if you have this i naught the initial amount you have", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i did is i substituted <expression> here and simplified", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of so we can have <expression> constant out there times the derivative of this inside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just plugging into a calculator at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could replace these words", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they say when will the population reach <expression> so theyre essentially saying when is at what time <expression> is <equation> so we can just say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this first says find an expression for the number of bacteria after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that this right here is the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could say instead of saying bacteria culture you could say a bank account initially contains 100 and grows at a rate proportional to its size which would mean compound interest", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thatll be an hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill do one on exponential decay as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this tells us that the bacteria at time <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has <expression> and it has <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in general anything that when youre dealing with exponential growth or exponential decay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then using this extra data point we solved for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just a little bit of logarithm math we did here", "entities": []}
{"text": "when will the population reach <expression> let me write what we have already done a little bit neater", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have two things in an exponent multiplied thats the same thing as taking that and then raising it to the third power right if we were simplifying wed say oh thats the same thing as just multiplying that times this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right because natural log says well what exponent do i have to raise <expression> to to get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i took this and i replaced it with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this tells us after an hour the population has increased to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just want to keep our original equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you think about it well ill draw the analogy as we do this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get taking the <expression> both sides of this the <expression>  well if you take the <expression> to something youre just left with the something", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do you figure out log base of another number of <expression> well the simple answer is you could take <expression> of this and divide it by the <expression> of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "they tell us right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "find an expression for the number bacteria after <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right because if you were to simplify you just take this exponent and multiply this and youd get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the chain rule tells us its just the derivative of this whole expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is going to be some bizarre number", "entities": []}
{"text": "or continuously compounding growth or continuously compounding decay though youll very seldom hear that term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense right because if <equation> this whole expression is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could rewrite our original bacterial function equation as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right i just took a this sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its good we left it in that form because it made the derivative all that easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that would be even a better answer for part a", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are they asking us for well theyre essentially asking us what is the slope of this function after <expression> hours or another way you could view it is what is the derivative at <equation> lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats pretty straight forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when we substitute here is that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then were going to take the definite integral so lets just say the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats this at any given point value of <expression> what is kind of going to be the high when were taking the area were taking a bunch of rectangles that are of <expression> width right so thats thats not dark enough i dont think that you can see that so thats one of my rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what do we get whats <expression> <expression> is the same thing <expression> and it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say thats one of my rectangles right here that im going to be summing up", "entities": []}
{"text": "the antiderivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression> and well have a minus sign out here so <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression> and so this minus minus those both become pluses <expression> is also <expression> so plus <expression> and so this <expression> and this <expression> will cancel out and all were left with is <expression> and that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of that times the width of each of these little rectangles which is infinitely small <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i were to take the derivative of <expression> lets say i took the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the <expression> value of the unit circle at <expression> or at <expression> its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "com you can actually get i couldnt find the actual multiple choice questions but you can find the free response questions and so this question is actually the first free response question that they have on the calculus bc that was administered just recently in 2008", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then these are a little bit more straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "it actually took me a whole video just to do that part", "entities": []}
{"text": "i received a suggestion that i do actual old ap exam problems and i looked on the internet and lo and behold on the college board site if you go to collegeboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is <expression> so the derivative to this is going to be times <expression> or you could say that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> times the derivative of the whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> is almost this it just has that <expression> there right so lets see if we can rewrite this so it looks just like the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so essentially were going to take the sum of all of these rectangles so its height is going to be let me switch colors arbitrarily the height is going to be the top function minus the bottom function", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> if i were to take the derivative of it what do i get that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats its height its height is going to be this top function minus this bottom function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its width is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says let <expression> this is <expression> be the region bounded by the graphs of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next video ill do part b and well just keep doing this and ill try to do a couple of these every day", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the antiderivative of this whole thing and ill arbitrarily switch colors again", "entities": []}
{"text": "this should be fairly straightforward for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the bottom graph is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this will be <expression> all right thats that evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> here minus the bottom function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so minus the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression> plus the antiderivative of this is <expression> or you could just view that as <expression> and then were going to evaluate that at <expression> and at <expression> and lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the antiderivative of this is <expression> right and this is just a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "well anyway they want so this is the region between these two functions and part a of this and this is kind of the softball question just to make sure that you know how to do definite integrals and it says find the area of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this top graph is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill just read it out because i dont want to write it out all here but this is the actual diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is part one part a of number one on the 2008 dc free response questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these terms dont contribute anything when you evaluate them at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill switch to magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of <expression> well what functions derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i did when you evaluate this <equation> so i can do this times <expression> and then thats <expression> and then all of that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that i think you know that were going to do a little definite integration so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to sum them all up from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression> remember i could just carry this over this is just a constant term this antiderivative is this right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to make sure i have enough space to do this entire problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "this should be reasonably familiar to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we do this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how did i know that this was the bottom one well i knew that this one was <expression> right because sine looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we evaluate this well we essentially take the antiderivative of this and then evaluate that at <expression> and then evaluate at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> so its <expression> <expression> is <expression> so <expression> so thats the antiderivative evaluated at <expression> and now lets subtract it evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and frankly if you understand how to do all of the free response questions you probably will do fairly well on the multiple choice because the free response tend to be a little bit more challenging especially the last parts of the free response", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt look like that right when you go <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well anyway lets do this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take the derivative of the inside right by the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "since im subtracting i switched both of these signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are the <expression> values were going to be going from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i actually copied and pasted this from the pdf that they provide on collegeboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "com", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "this curve probably comes back down and intersects over there at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this point right here our polynomial solver told us is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to draw it at an angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so order is <expression> enter", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to be the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway lets do part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just actually downloaded this ti85 emulator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what theyre saying this is the region r again just like in the previous two parts of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "say we took this crosssection of this solid right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it also intersects at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this is interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "for this solid each crosssection perpendicular to the xaxis is a square", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they told us that they do not want us to evaluate it so we are done with part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the order of this polynomial whats the thirddegree polynomial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can draw that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok it says the horizontal line <equation> splits the region <expression> this is <expression> into two parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember they just want us to write the expression not evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will continue this problem in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we had a <expression> function on the top", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i realized that they probably want us to use a graphing calculator to figure out the roots of this polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says right there a graphing calculator is required for some problems or parts of problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "for this solid each crosssection perpendicular to the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "its small squares and the squares get really big and then they get small again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to multiply that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way i drew it now it looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were going to take all of the sums from <expression>  whatever this point is to whatever this point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can kind of imagine what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could just write this and we should hopefully get full credit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the coefficient or the constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would be a crosssection", "entities": []}
{"text": "write but do not evaluate an integral expression for the area of the part of <expression> that is below the horizontal lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "looks something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the base of a solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not thick enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure out those points well what we could do is we can set them  each other so we could say at what <expression> values does <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just to show you the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the coefficient on the <expression> term well there is no <expression> term right so that coefficient is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we want to figure out the roots we use the poly function so second poly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they say the region <expression> is the base of a solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats off of this graph thats not even here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> would look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets keep doing the first problem from the 2008 calculus bc exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a crosssection perpendicular to the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "go down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the height of each of these little rectangles is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that well we do the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they care about the area of this part of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "go down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we took the crosssection of the solid here it would be like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure this out well the easy part is actually to figure out what the expression were going to take the definite integral of", "entities": []}
{"text": "right that looks like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can just hit solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "i kept trying to guess numbers or figuring out i even tried to do newtons method and i kept getting weird numbers and i became suspicious of myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "we take the area of each of these squares we know theyre squares times each of the dxs the small differential and we sum them up over from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the first diagram i think that was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the height of the rectangles is going to be the difference between the two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at what <expression> values are the <expression> values the same so we just set them  each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i looked at the actual test actually i can show it to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what they want us to do is figure out the volume of the solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that the base has to be the same height has to be the same disk size as the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that curve im going to draw it kind of with a perspective so you can see the solid theyre talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets use this to figure out the roots of this polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are three places where <equation> intersects <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the coefficient on the <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we wanted to write this is a proper polynomial expression we would get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need to figure out this point this value of <expression> which is going to be here and then this value of <expression> which is going to be there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its been a long time since i actually took ap calculus and now i remember that a graphing calculator was a big deal", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the same region <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this curve right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is probably right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can use those values that our graphing calculator gave us and put it into our definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the width of each of those rectangles we know from well just learning calculus or learning integrals the width is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this point right here so this is our limits of integration for our definite integral right were going to sum up these little rectangles from <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "go down again", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can draw it", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets turn it on", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets draw <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "they say that it is a square", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the volume of the solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what they want to know is an integral expression for the area of the part of <expression> that is below the horizontal line", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what are the coefficients well the coefficient on <expression> to the third term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh and im about to be out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "were on part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats too thick", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well put here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is <equation> and then this function right here is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what theyre saying is if it splits this region <expression> into two parts this part and this part", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe theyd want you to simplify this a little bit but id be surprised if they were mark off for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the height of each of these rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "it intersects at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thatll hopefully save us time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its like we took a knife and we cut like this we cut parallel to the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i actually just tried to record a video where i was doing this on the fly and i kept staring at this and i was like boy this is a hard polynomial to factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we took the crosssection there it would be a small square as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we had that polynomial function on the bottom that looks something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> will look something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the expression within the definite integral that we will use well just like we did in part a think about were going to take a sum of a bunch of rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it as a thick line and in a darker color maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "they say the region r is the base of a solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "here it would be a smaller square like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know if you can see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats somewhere off to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "trying to do a little bit of perspective so that we can visualize what theyre talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we get three crazy numbers and this shows you that this would have been very hard to solve analytically if you have a normal brain", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so these are really just two of the points where these two functions intersect each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "it also intersects at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its going to be a little bit harder to figure out the boundary points", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want you see the key strokes so that you ok turned on exit out of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to use the calculus function here so second calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that gives us the volume for each of these i guess parts of the entire solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so each base is going to be <expression> so <expression> right switch the sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "which you can do analytically you but you have to know some power reduction formulas in trigonometry you have to do some integration by parts it would probably use up all of the time on the ap exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the boundaries are pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "the area of each of the squares not just this distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure out the volume of this solid which is kind of hard to visualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a couple of minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see how much time i have left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure out the volume of this over here what is the depth its going to be <expression> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is kind of i think what they wanted you to do set up the integral recognize that each of the squares the area of each of the squares is just going to be this distance the distance between the functions squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this bottom function right here that is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so integrate from <expression> from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the expression let me move it down a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the area of each of these squares each of these crosssections what is the area well the base is going to be the difference between our two functions right this top function right here that was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we were doing part c of the first problem on the calculus bc exam the free response part and so what ill reread it it says the region r this is the region r is the base of a solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does part d say the region r models the surface of a small pond so thats the surface now", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the polynomial function below it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we were to sum up all of these infinitely thin solids we would get the volume for the whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "same thing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what it ends up with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so since they said that a graphing calculator is required for some parts of the problem i say why not use our graphing calculator because the graphing calculator is very good at numerically evaluating definite integrals like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here the height will be really high because this is kind of maybe our maximum point in terms of the base width", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what are our boundaries of integration well its the same thing as in part a", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i wanted to make this a little smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the answer that is the volume of this solid its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they say each crosssection perpendicular to the xaxis is a square", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the pond essentially gets shallower and shallower as we go to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know thats kind of hard to visualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do part d", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this definite integral function you have to tell it which is the independent variable or kind of you know what variable are we integrating across and thats the variable x", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says for this solid each cross section perpendicular to the xaxis right theres two ways you can do a crosssection you could do them you could cut this way but that would be parallel to the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway how do we figure out what the volume of this lake is but actually i realize im pushing nine minutes so i will continue this in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we take the crosssection just along the xaxis the depth is going to look something like this but then this is the top of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway what we do is we take the area of each of these squares and i drew one of them here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im pretty sure they want you to use a calculator because frankly computing the integral thats kind of just chug math you know very mechanical math although its pretty sophisticated but it would take you forever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the area its going to be this <expression> so we have to square this entire thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at this point the depth is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the base of the functions the base of this distance right here is going to be the difference between the top function and the bottom function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we just type in the expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you just tell it the boundaries of integration and were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i redrew the region r here but with a little perspective so we can hopefully visualize it in three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could almost imagine it let me see if i can draw it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> so you could write that this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so essentially <expression> is the depth right so at this point of this pond the depth is just <expression> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at all points <expression> at a distance <expression> from the yaxis the depth of the water is given by <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "press f5 definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we essentially just have to evaluate this now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the area of each of these squares and then we have to multiply them times a little bit of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here this would be the base and since we know the crosssection is the square the height has to be the same length as the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so here the depth of the pond is given by the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this function right here this is definite integral a very useful function to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you integrate that from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take you each of the area of each of these squares multiply them by a super small change in <expression> and that we know from everything weve learned in calculus hopefully that that super small change in <expression> im trying to draw a little perspective is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is its probably drawn in thats the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get out my ti85 emulator again", "entities": []}
{"text": "the region r models let me paste oh i didnt want to do that edit undo edit paste there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its in some ways you easier to visualize it than it is to draw so you have to give me some credit", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its open parentheses sin of where is pi pi is i havent used one of these calculators in a long long time oh there it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far this might look pretty similar to part a but whats the twist here we want the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "second <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its still pretty wide then it gets narrow again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the sin function with some perspective", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we multiply <expression> times <expression> that is the volume of this kind of part the entire solid", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wanted to cut perpendicular to the xaxis or parallel to the yaxis right so if we cut it along the line like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that well lets write our integral expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i drew a couple of squares here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so over here the depth is <expression> so if i were to draw so if i were to go straight down the depth is you know maybe its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i havent made a mistake i can hit enter and let the calculator do the rest of the work", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here the depth is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so essentially the pond is going to get shallower and shallower or as we go further to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just like in part b ive first tried to evaluate this analytically and you end up getting a very very very hairy integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we were to take a cross section so lets say that this lets take this cross section of the pond", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the volume this time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so to find the volume we think about it the same way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do second insert", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the height along the surface of the pond is going to be the difference between the two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not too different", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will every day try to do a couple of these problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets integrate from <equation> from <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "second enter", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could do second enter and well get the previous entry", "entities": []}
{"text": "at all points in <expression> at a distance <expression> from the yaxis the depth of the water is given by <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not squaring it anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it noticed it is calculating", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know this the height sorry the width along the surface of this cross section is going to be the difference between this function and this function right so if i were to draw let me see if i can so this is that same cross section its the width along the top i know im confusing you is going to be this function minus this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was part c that we already have in our calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we go here we can delete this squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats green", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does a cross section at any point of the pond look like well if we lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats going to be the height right here well they told us", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again this is a really hard integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the volume of the water in the pond", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want the volume for the entire pond we take essentially the volume of each of these kind of slivers of the pond", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only difference between what we did in part c and now is now instead of having in part c we had this expression squared", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> i think is a fair answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets do i want you to see my key strokes", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hopefully you found that useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the area of each cross section", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <equation> the pond is exactly <expression> i guess you know we could say feet or whatever the units are deep and then when <equation> the pond is <expression> unit deep", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> right thats the same thing as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we already typed in a bunch of stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "and our variable of integration is <expression> and were integrating from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets hit enter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets use the calculator to evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "deleted", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets insert times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we take the area of each cross section and we multiply it by a very small width to get a very small sliver", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we thought about this is you know a perspective drawing of this this is the surface of the pond right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says the region <expression> models the surface of a small pond", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we dont have it squared but were multiplying it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were doing the last part of problem 1 of the 2008 calculus bc exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we take that and multiply it by <expression> and we integrate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to draw let me see if i can draw this cross section", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know that the top function is <expression> and we know that this bottom function is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area of this cross section of the pond is going to be <expression> times the depth of the pond right thats the surface width times the depth", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in a different color i know it can be kind of confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and our answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we sum up all of these slivers of the pond from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the height of the pond or the depth of the pond at any point is <expression> whatever <expression> value were at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i was trying to draw the depth", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill repeat the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "or its something that you can do especially if you use integration by parts but its a little bit messy and you only have <expression> minutes to do all three problems on the bc exam so im assuming that they want you to use the calculator here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says concert tickets went on sale at noon <equation> and were sold out within <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since its twice differentiable we also know that its derivative is continuous because the second derivative exists at all points", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could say at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "everyone has gotten their tickets or maybe they got sold out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will continue part b in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "they give us that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets keep going forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "because theres a positive slope here and then it immediately switches to a negative slope like the absolute value functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they tell us its twice differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we divide it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats going to be right about there just approximating it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats about right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we really just have to do the first <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets keep going with our 2008 calculus bc free answer questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the best estimate i can do of the rate at which this <expression> is changing at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is noon 1200 noon 100 pm 900 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just approximating", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can grow that a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so doesnt hurt to just copy and paste", "entities": []}
{"text": "indicate the units of measure", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could write that as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the number of people waiting in line to purchase tickets at time <expression> is modeled by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this might seem kind of daunting", "entities": []}
{"text": "you actually wouldnt be able to take the derivative at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its good to do it neatly when youre doing the exam because otherwise youll confuse yourself", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> we have <expression> people in line", "entities": []}
{"text": "its about right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they dont give us a continuous function definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> minus <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> there are <expression> people in line", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its just going to be the slope between these two points", "entities": []}
{"text": "that should be good enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> we have <expression> people in line", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets plot the points", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the number of people waiting in line at anytime", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the real <expression> whatever we used to approximate it its not going to have these sharp edges because its differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation> the line is gone", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is my <expression> axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right if this was <expression> less it would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the denominator its hours people per hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "they just give us a bunch of sample points of this function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could say approximately  or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont have do it so neatly", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im about to graph it because i want you to understand how to do this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says part a let me make sure im not writing too thickly use the data in the table to estimate the rate let me actually just copy and paste this ive just figured out how to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to take up all the space though", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want to do this really fast you wouldnt have to graph it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i cut and pasted the table that they gave for the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do they want to know they want to know an estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first <expression> hours thats right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "they give us 400 pm and 700 pm or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so weve at least plotted the sample points and connected them with lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that whatever function were modeling this this <expression> that its continuous because its differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway back to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "its right about there", "entities": []}
{"text": "there to there almost done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill read the rest of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually i just realized", "entities": []}
{"text": "indicate units of measure", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can write it however you want however you think that the exam graders would best like to see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "there to there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see what we can do", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little bit more than at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually lets graph all of them just because it might be useful in future parts of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "connect the dots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could write average rate of change or <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets graph some of these points", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it says use the data in the table to estimate the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 530 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now for some reason its been limiting me again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so halfway up would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my best estimate or our best estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at 530 pm which is between these two points is the average slope between these two points", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats about right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this was the actual function you wouldnt be able to take a derivative at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me clear all of this so we have enough space for part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see how high should my <expression> values this is time right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they want us to use the units of measure", "entities": []}
{"text": "the trapezoidal sum for the fourth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its actually going to be a smoother curve right because we can take the derivative of any point", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression> people per hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "so from here to there", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets connect those points", "entities": []}
{"text": "no that doesnt look good", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok part b says use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know what that sound was from", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you understand it you dont have to graph it", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i can make this a little bit bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "rise over run or change in the value of the function divided by change in the independent variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "show the computations that lead to your answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <expression> hours that the tickets were on sale", "entities": []}
{"text": "you probably cant read it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets write it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the numerator this is people", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is in between these two is to just figure out the average rate of change between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could say that the average rate of change is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill copy and dont know if you can read it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they dont give us any data on 530 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i figure it doesnt hurt", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> they skip <expression> at <equation> its <expression> people in line", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure that out well the average rate of change is just the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually twice differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well ill read it out loud in case you cant see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were on problem number 2", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you werent graphing it while recording a video it probably would be a little bit faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes up to about <expression> is a high point at least on the data we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "for some reason youtube used to let me do longer videos because i thought i was a partner", "entities": []}
{"text": "and from there to there", "entities": []}
{"text": "what are our data points we have <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the tickets are sold by 900 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can lets see i can erase all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the average of <expression> and <expression> well the average of <expression> and <expression> lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so use trapezoidal sum with <expression> subintervals to estimate the average number of people that sounds very complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there had to be a sign change and so it had to pass through <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so from here to here we have a sign change", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the area of this first trapezoid well what do you do to find an area of a trapezoid its the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "use yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats another way to view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not doing velocity in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "enter", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry <expression> not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i would write down at the ap exam is i was like well the function is twice differentiable which means its derivative is continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "just want to make it as neat as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well have the average value of over the first <expression> hours of the people in line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my reason and actually you could use rolles theorem or the mean value theorem but the simplest reason is that here we have <expression> sign changes in the average velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "trusty ti85 emulator", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "or corollary to the fundamental theorem of calculus whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> or its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "were doing part b and part of problem number two", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> thats the derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this area right here is <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats good enough i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats my answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at some point since the derivative is continuous it doesnt jump around it had to be positive someplace in this range", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats an easier one right <expression> is right in between those two and we dont have to do much", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the average value well its going to be the average value between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think this graph is going to come in useful in part c by just glancing at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know the way i drew it it looks like the slope is <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can erase this i can erase that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its base is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which tells us the derivative is continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "so from here let me use a thicker line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will continue part d in the next video because im already over 10 minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me copy and paste it", "entities": []}
{"text": "or the average not the average velocity the rate the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it comes up like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can draw that a little bit i drew them in different colors just so you can see the trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this trapezoid goes goes from oh i dont know if im doing this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is one subinterval", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the total area under those trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you really just have to think about what theyre saying and its not that daunting", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the base is <expression> right from noon to 400 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this one we have this one and we have this trapezoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or in that case <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know a curve and then it maxes out at some point comes down", "entities": []}
{"text": "like there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then they ask us well whats the average value of the function well the average value is just the area divided by the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats going to use this graph too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me erase at least this top part", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the area of this trapezoid right here this bigger one well its base is <expression> right <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then another trapezoid there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the total area its just going to be the sum of these <expression> trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to erase all the unnecessary things", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll be a curve right anyway they say what is the fewest number of times that <expression> must be  <expression> well what happens when <equation> that means that we are at a local minima or a local maxima or sometimes an inflection point", "entities": []}
{"text": "right here its <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and between here and here it looks like the slope is also going to have to bottom out at some point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill use a line tool", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be very confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "right because another way to think about it if you just took the average value of the function so if the function was say this and you just multiplied that average value times the base you would get the same area as the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says a trapezoidal sum with <expression> subintervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this area of the trapezoid right here this first one is the base", "entities": []}
{"text": "divided by <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but at minima and maxima point we know for sure that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say <expression>  essentially lets say between <expression> points <expression> and <expression> its the difference between the <expression> points divided by the area under the curve of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from here to here we have a sign change", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is another subinterval", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the area of that trapezoid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just apply that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "right between here and here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so 1 trapezoid here and another trapezoid there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually twice differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets do part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "right the average value of a function  the area under the curve divided by you could kind of say the base of the figure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we can just eyeball it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok copied it", "entities": []}
{"text": "for <expression> is greater than <expression> is less than <expression> right what is the fewest number of times at which <expression> must be  <expression> give a reason for your answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could rewrite this as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and finally whats the average value of this trap or whats the area in this trapezoid well the base is <expression> right its going from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 148}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 152, "end_offset": 164}]}
{"text": "they dont tell us to round it or anything so im assuming thats you know if were saying the average number of people i guess we can have a fraction there", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so its the average", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have three trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i see theres <expression> very natural subintervals here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it says <expression> intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "were actually not going to use an interval", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the top part i can erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it maybe it maxes out and it comes down like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just divide this value by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know it might look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i just took the data they gave graphed it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the sum of those <expression> trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "it had to be negative someplace in this range", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write down the important points", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might not remember it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that same argument could be used between here and here and here and here", "entities": []}
{"text": "like boy i dont that sounds yeah you know i didnt learn trapezoidal sums or however you want to think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats reasonable", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets use the trapezoidal sum to figure out the area under this curve or an estimate of the area under <expression> and then we can divide by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what part are we were on part c", "entities": []}
{"text": "the base times the average value is the same thing as the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the real graph of this is going to look something you know let me do it in a bold color like magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have <expression> sign changes in the derivative right the derivative is positive over this interval or at least its average is positive then it goes negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "its continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we dont know that for sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its really a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could look at this graph and we could say well you know there has to be a minima point someplace in this range", "entities": []}
{"text": "or the average value between this height and this height", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats another way to view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to use a trapezoidal sum to estimate the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i just divide it by <expression> and im done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it says use a trapezoidal sum with <expression> subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <expression> hours", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we essentially just have to figure out the area of each of these trapezoids", "entities": []}
{"text": "edit paste", "entities": []}
{"text": "part b", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just need to figure out the areas of each of these trapezoids and thats my estimate of the area under the curve of <expression> from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "give us a reason", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the average value of a function and you learned this in calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i just eyeball it i say well i have <expression> maximum points and one minima point so the slope is going to  <expression> at at least <expression> points right but they tell us give us a reason for your answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me ill draw the dotted lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did that in the last video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer to part b is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres a maximum point right someplace in this range and its going to max out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they say use a trapezoidal sum with <expression> subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first <expression> hours that the tickets were on sale", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i connected these dots i just kind of wanted to get a shape of the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can be more formal when you write it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and frankly i havent taken calculus in <expression> years", "entities": []}
{"text": "so derivative is continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not like this sharp edged line right and how do we know its a curve because its differentiable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is <expression> let me use a calculator just so i dont make any mistakes", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me draw them", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats i think they call that the second fundamental theorem of calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and from here to here we could have a sign change", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would have taken you quite a while if you had to actually do the integral yourself", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were done", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if we want to know how many tickets were sold at <equation> thats just  the definite integral from <expression> to <expression> or we could also view it as the area under this curve from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "so thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "my independent variable is <expression> ive just swapped <expression> for <expression> there and im taking the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 119}]}
{"text": "that only took us four minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "its copy and pasted", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "i will see you in problem number three", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and they want us to round to the nearest whole number", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "so this is the derivative of the total tickets sold function", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or another way that we could write it is the total tickets sold so lets call that i dont know capital t sub well let me i dont want to do <expression> thats unintelligible so lets say the tickets sold as a function of time is going to be  the definite integral well we could say is at any time <expression> the tickets sold and this is the fundamental theorems calculus i think it might be one of its correlaries or actually sometimes it is the fundamental theorem of calculus i always forget my definitions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this integral right here you can solve it analytically using integration of parts which i just called the reverse product rule but you only have <expression> minutes to do all three of these problems and theyll let you use your graphing calculator and your graphic calculator is excellent at doing definite integrals and they just want the number right so lets use our graphic calculators to get that number", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the rate at which tickets are sold", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "between <equation> and <expression> or if we want to know the tickets sold between <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "based on the model how many tickets were sold by 300 pm so my <equation> to the nearest whole number so thats sometimes important", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the nearest whole number is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to copy so how do we do that we just do second the division button but thats calc definite let me use the definite integral and like what was lets see let me make sure i have that <expression> lets just use <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you dont want to give a decimal answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "were ready to do part d and let me copy and paste that in as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> per hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "see i dont think thats going to need this graph so let me just remove that with a color other than yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate at which tickets were sold for t for over this range is modeled by <expression> let me write that in case you cant see it is the rate at which tickets were sold", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it would have taken us even less if we didnt have to explain it", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we say <expression> tickets sold by 300 pm", "entities": []}
{"text": "click enter let the calculator do the work", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats the whole function", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know if you can read it but its helpful for me to review the problem on our clipboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  all we do is we take this expression we take the derivative of <expression> and we just assume that <expression> is some constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "i know it sounds fancy but youll see", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way to write this exact same thing is if we wrote that <equation> we could have written as this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all just what does a function look like in three dimensions and actually well go over the different types", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does that mean well that means if i were and actually let me give you a little notation before i show you what that means", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the most intuitive to me at least is a surface in three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can visualize that", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember were taking an implicit derivative here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets figure out how to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression>  i dont know when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see this is the xaxis the yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we had our traditional x and yaxis before but now lets give another dimension of height", "entities": []}
{"text": "the equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you said what is the slope of the tangent line any point on this graph actually has an infinite number of tangent lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill give you the link for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the height is the zaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "go back to the pen tool", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all that means is that if i give you an xvalue and a yvalue you get a zvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just the convention you know for drawing the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i thought its nice to see that notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the equation of that surface and let me just clear out everything just because well probably need the extra space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the slope of this function with respect to <expression> at the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is called the partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were going to learn is when you take a derivative in three dimensions you have to specify the direction that youre taking the derivative in", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets now expand our knowledge of calculus to the third dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill take that risk", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill use a different color for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we go and then we say well <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is just a convention that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we had to plot that point of the surface and maybe ill actually graph this one in a little bit we go along the xaxis <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well <expression> is just a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we would plot that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to hold everything else constant and take the derivative with respect to just one variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you have some constant times <expression> the derivative of that is just the constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have your palm of your thumb and then your thumb is going to open up in this direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so every time <expression> increases <expression> <expression> will increase by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said if we want to take a derivative its hard to you know you cant just say there is one derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rate at which the height or the rate at which <expression> is changing with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you take this point this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want the slope at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all what is the equation of this surface and i just picked one that they had on wikipedia", "entities": []}
{"text": "do we make increasing <expression> pointing out this way or do we make increasing <expression> point inwards and this gives us the convention", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that wall represents the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll start taking the partial derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are different types of representations well see when we start working with three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "just bear with me", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just the notation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i mean by that this is <expression> those colors really dont go well together", "entities": []}
{"text": "and make that toothpick tangent to the bowl and you can see that on any point on the bowl you can just rotate that toothpick around", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the yaxis and thats the zaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually no harder than taking a regular derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i mean by the cross product so if this is the unit vector in the <expression> direction so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say whats <expression> of i dont know <expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> comma <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just a good to know where did that convention come from this is kind of called a righthanded coordinate system", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to pick a direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> at the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then it becomes very hard to visualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that cap just means its a unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could have a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we plot the points on the surface and ill show you actually computer generated surfaces that are far more professional looking than anything i could possibly try to draw", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going in the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can view it as a <expression> with the top curled", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the slope is a little bit less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we go along the yaxis <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we define a surface in three dimensions well we can define <expression> as a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the unit vector for there is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of just the number with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "look at that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you would see if you kept doing that you would plot a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i think youd understand where you pick an xpoint you pick a ypoint and then z this surface right here without this line intersecting it this surface right here is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is in the ydirection so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the derivative of <expression> well were assuming <expression> is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont worry about this wall", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a number right <expression> is just a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the equation of that surface is and im going to remove this now so i dont sound like im melting", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that would mean <expression> is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw the cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is why i actually drew this wall here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "your thumb is going to point up which is the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me clean this up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the convention is to kind of follow the right hand rule where the xaxis taking the cross product of the xaxis with the yaxis  the zaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to slow things too down while im trying to do my screen capture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can kind of view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we could use this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this is a length of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well get to this in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i dont know lets pick one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its actually free", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> little cap", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does this mean well what is the slope of <expression> with respect to <expression> at say when <expression> is <expression> and actually lets pick smaller numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you see that right the tangent right here is increasing with increasing values of <expression> but a little bit less than <expression> degrees", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> and still a function of <expression> and <expression> right it still depends on what constant <expression> youre using  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "take a bowl or something that maybe you know like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then take a i dont know a toothpick", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you take the first vector put your index finger in the direction of the first vector middle finger in the direction of the second vector and your other fingers can do what they need to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we just say for any constant <expression> how much does <expression> change with respect to <expression> then we take the partial derivative this is the notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is going in the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this surface right here this is ill actually show you the graph of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "oops", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry of j right in the ydirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway im all out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to make sure you remember which variable is a variable and which one is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "its in ydirection but it has a magnitude of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i goes in this direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "because you can have a line in three dimensions or kind of a curve in three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to make sure i can do my hand properly", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is a surface i use using this java applet grapher", "entities": []}
{"text": "along this wall y is a constant right so if we assume that <expression> is constant then maybe we could take just the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im afraid that when i manipulate this graph itll slow down my computer and ill start sounding like im melting", "entities": []}
{"text": "and eventually we can expand this into n dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that this is my xaxis and ill draw the positive quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the natural question that you might want to ask and actually let me show you a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "thisll probably really slow down my computer but you can actually rotate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean think of it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can have a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we would essentially take the slope of this curve right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because if you look at this surface if you were to pick any arbitrary point on this surface and say what is the slope of that surface well it kind of has no meaning because you have to kind of pick a direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd plot a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can go up here i dont know wed go up <expression> units", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you kind of have to pick the orientation of that toothpick", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets get to the meat and potatoes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to slow", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is well how do we apply calculus to surfaces because actually let me bring that thing out again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say we wanted to hold <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think the most intuitive and none of these are directly intuitive i think you have to really be able to visualize them", "entities": []}
{"text": "this wall is the equation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i did i picked the point <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it in magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually im going to add more variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we just take the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway this is just a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to keep in mind whats constant and whats not", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we wanted to expand it all out the partial of f with respect to <expression> this is the function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial derivative with respect to <expression> ah sorry whats the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> well now <expression> and <expression> are just constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well not reverse it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this box is kind of the domain and the <expression> and <expression> dimensions that i define", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that <expression> and im confining it to three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could say that its going to be cosine of <expression> times the derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how much does <expression> change in the <expression> direction if we hold <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "although we can do it more", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> squared is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats also  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can just write that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i dont know just so you get used to the different notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> and the <expression> kind of do the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we would take the derivative of the xs", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the point <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to pick the direction that you want to go in the xy plane and then you could plot a tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you hold <expression> constant heres a tangent line at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "just a little bit of algebraic manipulation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i just want to rearrange it thats <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or we could rewrite this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do some that might confuse you so you see how to do them", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative in that direction is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do that in yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this what i did so this vertical line i just wanted to show you that when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> we treat as a constant now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then because when you take the derivative the constant just comes out of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so itll just be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> at that point or we could write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me erase this because i picked a different point where i graph and i graphed it ahead of time just to save time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a does have only one tangent plane but within a tangent plane there are an infinite number of tangent lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "delete that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  we figured that lets see <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of a constant with respect to <expression> is <expression> so ignore it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the slope in the <expression> direction at that point is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way were doing it now is <expression> is a variable <expression> is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "kind of i bounded it because it starts to increase really fast and you wouldnt be able to see all this interesting stuff that happens closer in", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can actually take we can actually zoom in on this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see its quite symmetric", "entities": []}
{"text": "this shows that the partial of the function with respect to <expression> the slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the part thats interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now were saying how much does <expression> change with respect <expression> if <expression> is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the hardest part about doing these partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the derivative of the second expression thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can actually rotate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of the first term with respect to <expression> well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we treat <expression> like a constant so cosine of a constant this is just going to be a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "there we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "not too difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually maybe ill do it more dimensions now that were not going to try to visualize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we just take the derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well anyway thats the fun with graphing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then finally the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually this is pretty cool", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> well its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could kind of view it as if you hold y constant heres a tangent line at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> times i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is this surface once again is the surface of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "times the second expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  <expression> <expression> plus lets put this <expression> out front just so we change the order", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> those are both constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> what is <expression>  lets see <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "zoom it a little bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i dont think i have to include this anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can rotate it just to get more intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is still going to be a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can visualize this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well everything else is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and like i said in the last video you can actually have infinite tangent lines", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> could just be i dont know <expression> or <expression> or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to zoom in on the part that is interesting let me translate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then these two lines this is if you think about it this is the line where <expression> is constant right so this is the slope in the <expression> or as the surface changes with respect to <expression> at this point right this is the tangent line relative to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now <expression> is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "before we move on to other functions lets also take the partial derivative of our function here <expression> or the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because youre so used to taking the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> im just doing the product rule here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets reverse it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to realize that anything with the <expression> is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can almost ignore that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could say <expression> its just a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this line shows that the partial of the slope or the partial the function sorry the partial of <expression> or the partial of the function with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can actually get rid of my parentheses there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can just write that out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because this equation is pretty symmetric", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that just kind of helps show you that ok that shows what point were working with", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this actually becomes pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact two lines define a plane and the plane thats defined by those two lines or any of the two tangent lines to that point defines a tangent plane to the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you see that both of those lines are tangent at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know its hard for you to get used to saying that oh <expression> thats just a constant number", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> still a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we take the partial with respect to <expression> at that same point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats why we did partial derivatives to begin with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the derivative of the second expression times the first expression times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the partial now in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the derivative of i dont know <expression> with respect to <expression> well its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "not too difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now let me rotate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this whole <expression> <expression> if <expression> is some number <expression> this is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets just chug through a bunch of partial derivative problems just so that you get used to the mathematics of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just want to put the minus out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its the graphing thing looks a little bit funny sometimes", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> right just substitute <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could put that out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we picked the point <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me bring in my graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are just points that the software has picked to actually display these vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "the magnitude of this vector is what is the slope in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "that might be useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "see if i can show that to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you look at it this is the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that none of these vectors have any dimensions in the <expression> dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to scale it anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "because even though were applying it to a threedimensional surface but then you can do the partial with respect to <expression> vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way to think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does that look like well what are each of the components of this vector what is <expression> in the <expression> direction what does that vector look like what is <expression> in the <expression> direction look like and this i have graphed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this parallel to this line is the vector in the xaxis right so at this point ive actually calculated the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the direction is just the i unit vector or in the direction of increasing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its more clear if we look from below the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me zoom out a little bit because i want you to see the actual axes theres the axes so all this says if i were to go in this direction i get the maximum slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and obviously if theres a function of more variables you could keep going and youd multiply the magnitude of the derivative in each of those dimensions directions times the unit vector in that dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can rotate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i would have traveled this direction in the <expression> <expression> plane then i will get the maximum increase in <expression> per unit that i travel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we saw there was some symmetry so the magnitude of this vector is the same as the magnitude of this vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient of our particular function its a partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its direction it just goes in the <expression> direction because its that times the <expression> unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want you to think about it a little bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is the y direction or the same direction as the <expression> unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i need to travel a little bit more in the <expression> direction and ill get the maximum change in <expression> if i travel there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we multiply that in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll see what i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i go in that direction i get a maximum upward slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can extend this to any dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you could extend it to <expression> dimensions but it becomes very hard to visualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient that we use this vector differential operator this upside down triangle the gradient of <equation> which is the unit vector in the <expression> direction so it gives the magnitude of the slope and the <expression> direction and then it points the vector in that direction plus the partial with respect to <expression> in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we figure that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why is that interesting well the gradient and this is the intuition the gradient tells you the direction in the <expression> <expression> plane you should travel in order to get the maximum slope in the <expression> dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same surface weve been working with but now ive plotted these points right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the plane defined by all of these vectors is all flat in the <expression> dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you add them together you get the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets actually show you what it looks like in the <expression> <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we multiply that in the <expression> direction or in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "if im here notice here the <expression> component of the gradient is much larger than the <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is more of a bowl as opposed to a hill but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to take the gradient in twodimensional space and youll see what that means in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i just go head on so im above the graph looking straight down at the graph and then the colors just show kind of you know where we are if i travel in this direction in the <expression> <expression> plane i get my maximum increase in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what does this mean and another way to view it you could have also written this as the gradient of <equation> and then all of that in the i direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "not times operated on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "zoom in there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i go in this direction my <expression> goes up like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i wanted to see the axes which you cant see now that im zoomed in but you took my word this was the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can actually zoom in a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the gradient says well if i travel in this direction in the <expression> <expression> plane notice that none of these have any <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats pretty neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly this vector right here i hope you can see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in my opinion at least the intuition is a little bit harder to get your head around than the actual mechanics but once you get it it makes a lot of sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the partial with respect to y and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets actually calculate the gradient of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you were to take any closed line where the <expression> is constant well actually i dont want to get into that too much but this gradient will actually be normal to any or itll be perpendicular to any curve where <expression> is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the magnitude", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually it becomes hard to visualize beyond what were doing right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does this mean well before i go into what it means lets actually calculate it for this and then ill show you what it means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this vector is the partial derivative of <expression> at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you add the two vectors together you get this vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if you wanted to do it into three space thats not going to apply to our problem because we only care about two dimensions right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative with respect to <expression> said what is the slope in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> and then that doesnt matter anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "they say that  the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can rotate this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well do a few more problems where we just calculate gradients just because i think its useful to get the mechanics", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre all kind of giving you directions in the <expression> <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just rotate it around", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just different notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "the j unit vector goes in the same direction as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do the rotated", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets learn a little bit about the gradient and well use the same function weve been using since were pretty familiar with its graph and its partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to take the gradient of this and then ill give you a little bit of intuition on what a gradient is", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the gradient tells you how do you get the maximum upward slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i can spin it around", "entities": []}
{"text": "and because of this notation a lot of people view this delta operator and actually its pretty consistent when we learn about the divergence and the curl a lot of people view this delta operator they actually define it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you could take the partial derivative with respect to any direction and the gradient gives you the direction in which the slope is the largest", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i go in that direction in the <expression> <expression> plane i get maximum <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember the partial derivative with respect to <expression> said what is the slope in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we calculated this in the two videos on the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the partial of this function with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you go to this point right here this is the magnitude of this vector shows what is the slope in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "if im on a hill the gradient of that surface will tell you at any point what direction you need to travel in to go up the hill fastest", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the partial with respect to <expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just calculated the partial derivative at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully that makes some sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to get too involved with that right now so lets go back here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this vector says what is the magnitude of this vector is the partial derivative of the function or the partial derivative of the surface or the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or the direction which the steepness of the hill is maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can pull it down a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "it gave this length", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "or another way to view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the magnitude is determined by the partial derivative of <expression> at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say the temperature in a room is a function of where i am in the room", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient of <expression>  now you might be daunted", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you can kind of view it as almost a threedimensional slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "all a scalar field means is that in any point in this base and in this case were dealing with threedimensional space at any point in that space we can associate a value", "entities": []}
{"text": "associated with every coordinate is just a temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually the gradient of the function that we just solved for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets write our temperature function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of that with respect to <expression> is just going to be these are just constants so the derivative with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would just get a temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how would we view the gradient of this function well the gradient of this function is going to tell us in which direction and actually the gradient of this function is going to generate a vector field because its going to tell us in which direction do we have the largest increase in temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say its a function of my <expression> <expression> and <expression> coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of the outside expression the way i imagine it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats a scalar field one that i find fairly intuitive is temperature in a threedimensional room", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not what were learning here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you wanted to know the gradient at any point in space you would substitute an <expression> <expression> and <expression> in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me make it bigger so we can explore it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the radius away from the center thats just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the derivative of <expression> the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway ill see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times the derivative of the outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the radial distance away and this actually isnt that relevant to learning gradients but lets get a little intuition about what that actual temperature function how it actually changes as you go through the room", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase this thing down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we have a <expression> kelvin heat force in the center of our room", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the temperature function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then all of that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets try to get our heads around what the gradient of a function of three variables looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets actually fly in to the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then all of that times the unit vector in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "the harder part is the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you get closer and closer to our heat source the rate at which the temperature increases increases right the vectors as you get closer get bigger and bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember <expression> the temperature at any point was a scalar field", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the last video we had a threedimensional surface where the height <expression> was a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i first learned gradients i think the computation is relatively straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to switch from this blue color because its a little nauseating", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the derivative of the whole thing is just itself again", "entities": []}
{"text": "where the magnitude are the partial derivatives and then the direction is given by <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh i have an e to this three variable function how do i take the partial derivative remember if youre taking the partial derivative with respect to <expression> you just pretend like the <expression> and the <expression> are constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "you wouldnt get a temperature and a direction so its not a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative of this inner function with respect to <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the intuition is always the interesting thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "kind of radially further and further away from that source", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also the magnitude of those vectors in that vector field will tell us how large of an increase in temperature we are looking at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we just plug and chug and figure out the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that center of the room is at the coordinates <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and hopefully this temperature analogy and not even analogy this temperature model will make a little sense to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway the more important thing is i always find with gradients its easy to calculate them but the intuition oh sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me zoom in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were now within the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could write it as the gradient function is a function of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it applies to pretty much any scalar field", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why <expression> is such an amazing number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope that doesnt confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "at any point in three dimensions it just gave you a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually im not going to go into that because i realize im running out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the direction is given by the relative weighting of the <expression> <expression> and <expression> components", "entities": []}
{"text": "so plus whats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> well its going to look very similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you add them together like you would add any vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when you have the gradient at any point in three dimensions it gives you a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is also included", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the easiest one for me to imagine is a scalar field", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just the pythagorean theorem in three dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so itd be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "right and now we can do the same thing for the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "right <expression> is the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im just saying that it exponentially decays as you get further and further away from that source", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of <expression> i wrote <expression> just to kind of give you the intuition that this expression is just saying the square of the distance as we get away from the center of our room or from the coordinate <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you can simplify this algebraically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know i have never actually modeled temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it gave us surface in threedimensional space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get an intuition of what this gradient function will actually look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats pretty good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets write temperature as a function of <equation> which is exactly what i wrote up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i hope i didnt confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then finally the partial derivative of the temperature function with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say our temperature function im just making this up i dont know if this is an accurate model of temperature its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats why its called a scalar field", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can imagine as you go further and further away from that heat source its going to get colder and colder", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take the derivative of the inside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve gone from having a scalar field to a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets compute the gradient and then ill show you a diagram that might make things a little bit more intuitive", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why did i say r i said its a function of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets say i have i dont know a <expression> kelvin actually let me make it so that our vector field works out right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you can see at any point and when this graphing program that did it it just picked different points and it calculated the gradients at that point and then it graphed them as vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then all of that times the unit vector in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the way i view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see as we get closer and closer to the center of our heat source the vectors the rate at which the temperature increases gets bigger and bigger and bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right because it has <expression> <expression> and <expression> components", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a <expression> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the length of the vectors are just the magnitudes of the <expression> <expression> and <expression> components", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want you to understand at least conceptualize this its hard to draw a scalar field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient of <expression> is going to be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could distribute this minus if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we could simplify this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you were to take a thermometer and measure any point in space in the room that youre in right now you would get a temperature", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write it up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> here this is just a constant that when you take the derivative of a constant times something the constant carries over", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient of the temperature function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im treating the other two variables that im not taking the partial derivative with respect to as constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you can see the intuition is pretty interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but a common mnemonic to remember the operation of diverge and is to write the upside down triangle which was the same notation we used for gradient but take the dot product of that and the vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i have a particle here its velocity in the xdirection is going to be <expression> to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you take the divergence of something youre going in the opposite direction in some ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <equation> i could have picked any points but im just picking the numbers thats easy to calculate when <equation> what is the magnitude of the vector its <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or we can even lets do it in two dimensions but ill make it constant in the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its velocity in the ydirection i dont know maybe its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you start with the vector field right and whats a factor field its something that if you give me any point <expression> and <expression> ill give you a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if we went to three dimensions the partial derivative with respect to <expression> and the kdirection et cetera et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the derivative of this with respect to <expression> if <expression> is just a constant <expression> is just a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok oh i didnt want to do that dot", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for any <expression> the magnitude of the vector doesnt change right its only dependent on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be twice as big", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its velocity in the xdirection is actually a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in one dimension", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say this vector field just for the purposes of visualization it could be anything but lets say it represents the velocity of particles of fluid of any point in two dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember if i have a particle right here in my fluid if this is a particle its velocity in the xdirection is going to be 1 meter per second to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that is the divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> <expression> with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at any point in the xdirection at any point <expression> comma <expression> its velocity in the xdirection will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the divergence at a point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of this with respect to <expression> is just <expression> plus whats the derivative of this with respect to <expression> well you could just do <expression> since its a constant as the coefficient on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the correct way to write it is the divergence of our vector field <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then oh thats difficult because i have these <expression> and these <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be a function of <expression> and <expression> so the velocity at any point its a vector field lets say it is and im just going to make up something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first like i did with gradients ill show you the mechanics which are actually pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres never a y component to the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then for example here itll be even longer", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> we just pretended y is a constant just a number so the derivative of this with respect to <expression> would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you took the dot product of that and that it would be the partial derivative with respect to <expression> of that expression of <expression> <expression> and then plus the partial derivative with respect to <expression> of that second expression the <expression> component of <expression> and then you would evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets say the velocity of fluid or the particles in fluid at any point in the <expression> <expression> plane lets say it  <expression> plus i dont know <expression> theres never any sorry <expression> right <expression> is the unit vector in the ydirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just take the partial derivative of the <expression> component with respect to <expression> and you add that to the partial derivative to the y component with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets make this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then ill try to give you the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see what divergence is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets try to get a little bit of intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i have a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would that look like i dont need a computer to draw this", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has no <expression> component ignore this right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "one thing to immediately realize even before we work on the intuition is when we did gradient i gave you a surface and it gave us a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can handle this one myself i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well see if you just keep your head straight on whats constant and whats not its not too bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i gave you a scalar field and you got a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just do one more point", "entities": []}
{"text": "that we just have an expression that if you give me a point anywhere in this vector field i can tell you the divergence at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i think youll find that the computation of divergence isnt too difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you wanted to graph it in the <expression> <expression> plane youd have a bunch of vectors and ill show you how that looks in a second when we go over to intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me do just do one more just hit the point home and then well work on intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you get the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just did the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> is  ill just sample some points and draw some vectors when <equation> lets say <expression> is <expression> there whats the magnitude of this vector itll be <expression> right actually let me make this a different number because itll make it hard to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats its velocity in the xdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "well when you take the divergence of it you get a value for any point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres going to be <equation> its going to be even longer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that my let me erase this ill probably need some space", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were dealing with a twodimensional vector here so lets just stick with two dimensions <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be a twodimensional vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i said that i had i dont know lets say my vector field is <expression> plus so its interesting my xdirection is dependent on my ycoordinate plus i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "only in the xdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would this turn out to be if you took the dot product of this which is this upside down triangle with this vector field what would you get well you would just get the partial derivative of the <expression> dimension with respect to <expression> so you would get its actually pretty straight forward to memorize you might not even need this mnemonic right here this abuse of notation you might just know it off hand the <expression> component you take the partial derivative with respect to <expression> and the <expression> component you take the partial derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats my velocity to the right ill do it in a different color just so that you dont get confused", "entities": []}
{"text": "the further you go to the right the faster the particles are moving towards the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so itll be <expression> plus whats the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well theres nothing else to hold constant so its just like taking the derivative with respect to <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it once you get it youre like oh thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could almost view it as a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if thats the yaxis thats my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and once you have the intuition at first it will seemed very i dont know unintuitive maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "so even though a vector field has all these vectors on it the divergence tells you an actual scalar number at any point in the field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could just ignore this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to get our heads around the idea of divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the divergence of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill show you why it looks like the dot product", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the divergence so a couple of ways we can write it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its velocity in the ydirection is just a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get a little bit of intuition of what a divergence actually is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you had the <expression> you would do the same thing so on and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> is <expression> the magnitude of my vector is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh i just realized that i ran out of time so i will continue this in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you remember from the gradient discussion we said that you can view although its kind of an abuse of notation but you could view this upside down triangle as being  the partial derivative with respect to <expression> in the xdirection plus the partial derivative with respect to <expression> in the ydirection which is the junit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the general idea here and as we move up in <expression> it doesnt change much right it doesnt change at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could just say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our <expression> value doesnt coughs", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we draw the vector here itll be even longer right if you do it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could almost say you know that the divergence of <expression> im going to make up some notation here as long as you get the point across you can say that the divergence of <expression> that this is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i just wanted you to see something in two dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats happening on the right hand side i have particles exiting really really fast right and lets say in a given amount of time lets say in one second in one second out of the right side since the particles are moving really fast im going to have a bunch of particles leave the right hand side right and in the same amount of time i will have some particles come in through the left hand side but its going to be a fewer number of particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the partial derivative so its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres going to be more and more particles in that space over time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does it mean if we have a <expression> divergence so lets try to create a vector field that has a <expression> divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to be getting less dense at any given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "when its positive if i have a positive divergence the particles or the field is diverting out of that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "it makes sense right because if as we move to the right and it kind of gets funky if you go into the other quadrant so well stick to the first quadrant while were trying to get our intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the classic example of a divergence is a field that looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where we left off i was attempting to give you the intuition of divergence and then i ran out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so clearly this area is going to become less dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at any given point has no <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "or since we know that this is the velocity of particles as we go in the <expression> direction the particles go faster and faster to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "it only depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but even here if i were to draw some region the same amount is entering as exiting", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the further we go to the right or the more we go to the right the faster the particles are moving to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said ok when <equation> the magnitude of the velocity is <expression> maybe meters per second if thats our unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i was drawing it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the magnitude of the vectors no matter what my value of <expression> is always going to be the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know it doesnt depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the classic example of a divergence although i wanted to show you that what matters is the net thats coming in to a certain area", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all of the velocity is only in the <expression> direction there is no upwards movement in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the previous example it was a source of particles more were coming out than going in", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take an arbitrarily im going to draw it in a different color and this circle could be arbitrarily small but im drawing it pretty large so it can include some of our vectors that ive drawn", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the magnitude is always <expression> in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that the partial derivative with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the points would be the vectors would have a slope of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now more going in through the right than coming out", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does that tell us well if you just look at the definition right we essentially just took the how much does the magnitude of the field increase in the <expression> direction and we see it visually", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its not getting any denser at any point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do a fancier example in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so obviously in any given amount of time that point is getting more and more dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so after a certain amount of time whats happening lets say after a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "more are leaving than are coming in", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i were to graph it this is my yaxis this is my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one half i had all these scratch offs", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it makes sense because as we move to the right our particles are getting faster and faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the divergence ill use this notation the divergence of our vector field is just a partial derivative with respect to <expression> which is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets draw it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this positive divergence tells us that at that point or really at any point in this vector field since the divergence is <expression> everywhere at any point in this vector field the field is becoming less dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope of how much our <expression> component is increasing is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets try to get our handle on what divergence means", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway ive run out of time again", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive never actually heard it this way but maybe a negative divergence we view as a convergence right converge is the opposite of diverge", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that divergence of <expression> of our velocity vector field you could also view that if you want to abuse some notation is our del vector dot <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the classic example of a positive divergence is a point where from every direction things are leaving it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say my vector field is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you have a divergence of <expression> that means that that part of the field is not becoming any more or less dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here at like say the point <expression> my velocity is going to be the left <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could say that more is flowing out of any point than flowing in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me clean it up a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw that", "entities": []}
{"text": "vector field is always <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if were talking about velocity of particles after any moment in time more particles are leaving than coming in because no particles are coming in", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <equation> the velocity to the right will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in any given amount of time in my defined space its going to get denser and denser", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to draw a region whats happening here are more particles entering than leaving or leaving than entering no", "entities": []}
{"text": "its still a constant right so this velocity field or vector field will look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its getting denser or you could almost view it as this space is sucking up particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "the velocity im just going to rewrite it <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think itll start to make sense once i draw the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a field that looks something like this this is the classical example of a negative divergence right where from every direction you have particles entering nothings leaving", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that kind of just falls out of the fact that our derivative with respect to <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats this example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "where maybe thats the <expression> thats the <expression> this is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all lets take that the divergence of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense because the divergence of this vector field well both of them actually the divergence of that vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well just stay at a onedimension just for the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we only have one dimension so its the partial derivative of the <expression> magnitude with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that the vector field  is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that divergence of this vector field at any point is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the point <expression> my velocity is going to be the left <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so every point is getting denser and denser actually everywhere in this field", "entities": []}
{"text": "its infinitely small but were just trying to get some intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i have a negative divergence maybe lets define a new term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what a negative divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what this tells us what this positive divergence tells us is if we were to take lets just take an arbitrarily small circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its  well the derivative of this with respect to <expression> is just  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could view a positive divergence as you could kind of say well the field is becoming less dense at that point or the point is a source of the field or its a source of particles depending on what model you want to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "for any amount thats coming in an  amount are coming out in a certain amount of time if we use velocity as our example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually at every point in this field we have a negative divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "now with that said lets take the opposite situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets draw a little circle and see whats happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way you could think about it is in any given amount of time whats happening in this space i have a few particles entering in through the left and i have a much larger number of particle leaving through the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway i had defined this fairly straightforward vector field that tells us the velocity of particles in a fluid at any given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the velocity <expression> its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> well thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im having a few particles leave through the left hand side right but i have many more particles entering this little region that ive defined this little circle im having many more particles enter through the right in a given amount of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way to think of it if you have a constant vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could have done it let me show you another", "entities": []}
{"text": "as we go increase in the <expression> direction the field gets stronger and stronger", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here even though some particles are leaving through the left many more particles are coming through the right so its getting denser and denser", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats going to happen in this space its going to become less dense right because in that space is going to be fewer particles after a certain amount of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could be anywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as we go to the right our velocities are going getting faster and faster which means if we were to draw a circle anywhere were always going to have more exiting the right than entering through the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "if my function was lets say it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could almost view it as any given point is almost a source of particles or if you have a sphere more particles are going to be coming out of the sphere through the right than coming in through the sphere to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could almost say lets think about the word divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me click clear up some space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when is the <equation> well if we factor the <expression> thats the same thing as we could rewrite our vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the divergence we take the partial derivative of the <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we were to draw a circle around here we see the vectors on the lefthand side of that circle that you cant see because i cant draw on this graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i could zoom in a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know its hard to see but anywhere along the line you see just as much entering as leaving", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know what this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a look at the graph and see if it if its consistent with our intuition of what a divergence is and the numbers we found", "entities": []}
{"text": "so negative divergence you can view it as getting denser or its actually converging", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we see the magnitude gets very small", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all lets just look at the original vector field and think about when does that vector field have some interesting points well i think some interesting points are when either the <expression> or the <expression> are  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said that at the point <expression> <expression> we see that in the ydirection its actually converging right above <equation> the arrows are pointing down and below it the arrows are pointing up right so in the ydirection were actually converging or we have a negative divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre increasing in magnitude", "entities": []}
{"text": "make it simple so that we only have one thing to factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually something interesting is happening at these two points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try to figure out when is the <equation> so this is divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "or we could just say that the divergence of <expression> at any point <expression> so this is a function of <expression> and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its kind of like particles are getting deflected out", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think i can delete this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> the divergence is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and going to show you a graph of this field soon so well get an intuition of what it actually looks like instead of my notsoaccurate drawings", "entities": []}
{"text": "up here we figure the diverge is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so along this line the divergence of the vector fields <equation> along the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres only <expression> in the <expression> so we just take the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want to know when does that  <expression> so lets set it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we go to the bottom if we go here on the line it looks like maybe there are less entering but theres also less leaving", "entities": []}
{"text": "so on a net basis between both dimensions you have no increase or decrease in density along that line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we see that the vectors entering it the magnitude of the vectors entering it are larger than the magnitude of the vectors exiting it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we add that to the partial derivative of the <expression> or <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could just make this a less than sign then solve and youll get <equation> you want to know when the divergence is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "right around here theyre all pointing inwards  but they get smaller and smaller as you approach the point <expression> 1<expression right we also said at the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at what points are well lets first decide what point is <equation> lets say at what point is a <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if i were to draw a boundary more is going to be coming out of the right than entering to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation> the divergence is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "if that square is my region we see the vectors on the lefthand side are larger than factors leaving are larger than the vectors entering it right so if in a given amount of time more is leaving than entering then im becoming less dense or you could say that the particles are diverging", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats why the divergence is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and hopefully this will make everything a little bit more tangible", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in any given amount of time more is coming in than leaving", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but actually lets just say the square", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other point <expression> <expression> once again we see the magnitude get small and then <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> right <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is the point <expression> <expression> and we that the magnitudes of the vectors are <expression> at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the velocity of the fluid or the particles in the fluid at any given point in the <expression> plane lets say in the xdirection it is <expression> in the xdirection <expression> in the ydirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the points where theyre both  <expression> are <expression> <expression> <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> right because then both components are <expression> <expression> <expression> or <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we just factored that thats <expression> and its the same polynomial just with  for the ycomponent so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have space to show it but i think you remember this is you know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got our points we figured out what coordinates are the magnitude of the vector field <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its getting denser or its converging", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats consistent with what we found out that the vector field gets very small at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "things are entering any given spot", "entities": []}
{"text": "have it graphed here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is <expression> when <equation> these are just the roots of this polynomial when <equation> or <equation> right and the <expression> is <expression> when <equation> or <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets look at some of the other points", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could be finished there or we could just put it in our traditional <expression> form thats the way i find it easier to visualize a line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the points where the magnitude of the velocity of our fluid or the particles of the fluid are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say at the spot right so it makes sense if our partial derivatives are positive that means that the magnitude of our vector is getting larger and larger for larger values of our <expression> and <expression> right so if the magnitude of our vectors are getting larger and larger for larger values of <expression> and <expression> the vectors on the right are going to have a larger magnitude than the factors on the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "and does that make unintelligible an arbitrary point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well see that on our graph in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i cant draw on this graph but if we drew a circle right there lets assume that thats on that the line <equation> we would see that in a given amount of time just as many particles are entering through the top right as leaving through the bottom left right a lot of entering through the top right and a lot of leaving through the bottom left", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i hope i havent confused you too much but i have run out of time once again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said the divergence is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i think weve done all of the analyzing we can do", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the definition of our vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say the square is my region right this one right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and before i run out of time i just want to give you that core intuition again of why the divergence is positive and why that means that things are flowing out when the rate of change is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just theres only an <expression> here so we dont really have to worry about keeping <expression> or <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the line <equation> starts the <expression> is going to be <expression> and its going to come down like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here too we see that the magnitude of the vectors get very very very small", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets figure out the divergence of our vector field the divergence of our field", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in the xdirection things are getting pushed out right so the reason why the divergence is 0 here you might have particles entering above and below a certain space but you have just as many particles exiting to the left and the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope you can see this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if were above that line the divergence is going to be positive right because if you just made this a greater than sign that would carry over", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could zoom in again", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just do the math first", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the vectors though are about the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway so the divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we actually look at the graph it makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we figured out we just figured out when the <expression> and the <expression> are  <expression> and then we said when are both of them  <expression> and we said oh well at the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can divide both sides of the equation by <expression> and you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense because i have a positive divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "its really just a derivative of this expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we go here where the divergence is negative lets pick an arbitrary spot", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so anything along at any point along that line the divergence is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets do a slightly fancier example then well try to analyze the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me ask another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "now before i show you the graph lets analyze this function a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you have a positive diverge or youre getting less dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre both  <expression> if we have any combination of these points", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other interesting thing we said ok when does the divergence  <expression> well the divergence equaled <expression> along the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can simplify this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we set that  <expression> oh sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say this square right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my major flaw adding and subtracting", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw my twig", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the magnitude of the vectors increase they increase perpendicular they increase in the ydimension right and when this happens when the flow is going in the same direction but its going at a different magnitude you see that any object in it will rotate right so lets think about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that makes sense also because as you go in the xdirection the magnitudes of the vectors increase", "entities": []}
{"text": "you put a twig there what would happen to the twig if the twig rotates and theres some curl if the magnitude of the rotation is larger then the curl is larger", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the top of the twig is going to be being pushed to the right faster than the bottom of the twig right so whats going to happen the twigs going to rotate right after i dont know some period of time the twigs going to look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because when we you might want to review our original videos where we compared the dot product to the cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats going to happen to the twig well at this point on the twig the waters moving to the right so itll push this part of the twig to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the intuition there all of a sudden we care about how much is the magnitude of a vector changing not in its direction of motion like in the divergence example but we care how much is the magnitude of a vector changing as we go perpendicular to its direction of motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for given <expression> the magnitude of your <expression> vector might stay the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that because the vectors increasing in a direction that is perpendicular to our direction of motion right this fairly simple example all of the vectors point in the xdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this dell operator we use it a bunch of times", "entities": []}
{"text": "because remember if this is a vector and then as we increase this in the xdirection the vectors increase we took a little point and we said oh at this point were going to have more leaving than entering so we have a positive divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "i didnt even label the <expression> and <expression> axis", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and maybe in the xdirection theyre constant regardless of your level of <expression> the magnitude stays", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the dot product was how much do two vectors move together so when youre taking this dell operator and dotting it with a vector field youre saying how much is the vector field changing right all a derivative is a partial derivative or a normal derivative its just a rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the top of the twig the water is also moving to the right maybe with a faster velocity but its also going to push the top of the twig to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its just i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember these are just sample points on our vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll see that theres a net torque on the twig", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here even if we make <expression> larger we still get the same magnitude", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so just like what we did with torque we now care about the direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this might give you a little intuition of what is the curl", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the magnitude of the xdirection is just a function of your <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats enough of just getting the intuition behind that vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "the bottom will move a little bit to the right but the top will move a lot more to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next video ill actually compute curl and maybe well try to draw a couple more to hit the intuition home", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it rotates in the other direction youll have the negative direction of curl", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the ultimate would be let me draw another vector field the ultimate would be if i had this situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i were to lets say that this vector field shows the velocity of a fluid at various points", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here ive drawn im going to just draw a twodimensional vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "right and the whole thing would have been shifted to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you put a twig here you would definitely hopefully see that the twig not only will it not be shifted to the right this side is going to be moved to the left this side is going to be the right its going to be rotated", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i realize ive already pushed 9 minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "its only dependent on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i mean this vector field might look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know if the partial derivative of something in the idirection plus the partial derivative something with respect to <expression> in the jdirection plus the partial derivative well this is if we do it in three dimensions with respect to <expression> in the kdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this should be a little bit intuitive to you at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we applied it to just a scalar or vector field you know like a threedimensional function we just multiplied this times that scalar function we got the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if that was where your intuition led you and that is what your guess is you would be correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for any given <expression> its always going to be the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it is a measure of how much is that field rotating or maybe if you imagine an object in the field how much is the field causing something to rotate because its exerting a net torque because at different points in the object you have a different magnitude of a field in the same direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial derivative with respect to <expression> is rate of change in the xdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> is relatively low our magnitude vector goes in the <expression> direction when it increases a little bit it gets a little bit longer", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully that example i just showed you will make a little bit of sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as your <expression> get bigger and bigger the magnitude in your xdirection will get bigger and bigger proportional to the square of the magnitude of the y direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the intuition because now we dont care about the rate of change along with the direction of the vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can kind of write it as a vector operator and then it has a little bit more meeting", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just making up numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe after a little bit further maybe it looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i place a twig right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if you have a different speed for different levels of <expression> as something moves in the xdirection its going to be rotated right you could almost view it as if theres a net torque on an object that sits in the water here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can extrapolate to <expression> but when were getting the intuition its good to do it in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could imagine up here thats going to the left with a fairly large magnitude", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all youre saying is when youre taking a dot product how much is my rate of change increasing in my direction of movement how much is my rate of change in the ydirection increasing in the ydirection and so it makes sense that it helps us with divergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "we care about the rate of change of the magnitudes of the vectors perpendicular the direction of the vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i dont want to confuse you too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i were to take a little twig or something and i were to place it in this fluid so let me place the twig right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the curl of the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve been dealing with this dell vector or this you know we could call this abusive notation but it kind of is intuitive although it really doesnt have any meaning when i describe it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when we learned about dot and cross product what did we learn we learned that the dot product of <expression> vectors tells you how much <expression> vectors move together and the cross product tells you how much the perpendicular its kind of the multiplication of the perpendicular components of a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the curl essentially measures what is the rotational effect or i guess you could say what is the curl of a vector field at a given point and you can you can visualize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as we can see as our change in the ydirection as we go in the ydirection the <expression> of our vectors get larger and larger", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i place a twig its a funnylooking twig but thats good enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you can view this were looking down on a river maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway i dont want to confuse you too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw another vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we care whether its going counterclockwise or clockwise so were going to end up with a vector quantity right so and all of this should hopefully start fitting together at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if the derivative the partial derivative of this vector field with respect to <expression> is increasing or decreasing if its just changing that means as we increase in <expression> or as we decrease in <expression> the magnitude of the <expression> of our vectors right the xdirection of our vectors changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "before i actually show you the mechanics of what the curl of a vector field really is lets try to get a little bit of intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i had this situation where maybe down here its like this then maybe its like this and then maybe it gets really small then maybe it switches directions up here and then the vector field goes like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its going to rotate a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me ask you a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the curl you might guess  the cross product of our dell operator and the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we took the dot product of this with a vector field we got the divergence of the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont want to make that mistake this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is maybe messier than i originally intended", "entities": []}
{"text": "erase that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> well <expression> is just a constant so its going to be well we can just put the <expression> out front but eventually we want to write our magnitude before the vector so its <expression> times the partial of this with respect to <expression> with our constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then this becomes plus plus plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just a constant so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well take the curl of a fairly fancy vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then finally our <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll get something fairly hairy although this was i think a hairier than average problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "then here its <expression> i should written all of this bigger and then the third column the <expression> component is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah thats pretty much it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what i wanted to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just kind of the algorithm of how do you take a determinant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the magnitude in our kdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the partial of this with respect to <expression> <expression> is just a constant right so the partial of this with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no thats not what i wanted to do i wanted to do it in a darker color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do this so the cross product is going to be  i didnt have to draw a straight line so how you take the cross product of this vector field and the gradient operator well you write <expression> <expression> <expression> on top like youre taking the cross product of any two three dimensional vectors and then you take the first vector but its really a vector operator but its this del operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "well when you were using this engineering notation when you have a vector broken down into it <expression> <expression> and <expression> components or its <expression> <expression> and <expression> components you can take the determinant of that matrix when i showed you how to compute the cross product to figure out the cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> cross these columns there minus the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the <expression> <expression> and <expression> components", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  the <expression> let me use a more vibrant color the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe well graph it for fun just to see how messed up it looks but we said this curl you could view it as a cross product of our del operator and the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok then finally we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you multiply the partial with respect to <expression> operator times that expression youre really just taking since its an operator and not an expression youre really just going to take the partial of this with respect to y but ill write it down", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the curl of the vector field <expression> at any <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have minus because minus in the jdirection whats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression> well the partial of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "why dont we take this row and columns and this is the submatrix of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now finally plus whats the partial of this with respect to <expression> well these are just constants so its <expression> once again we just have a <expression> term everything else is a constant so the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you cross out its row and column and so you take the determinant of this expression so its going to be times this times this but its really the partial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were pretty much done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean we can simplify it a little bit just to make it clean", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial with respect to <expression> of this sorry we take out its row and column so <expression> of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just take this expression and ill multiply it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets actually compute it because if your sole goal is to pass a test and not understand the nature of the universe which i think would be sad but if that is your goal you at least need to know how to calculate these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you understood what i did here and now we got this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i think i can erase all of this and just so i can have some room to simplify things in", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right now let me try to simplify it and ill have to get some space", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we are ready to take the determinant which will probably well itll probably get pretty messy but lets try it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next video well do a little bit of this but i think itll give you more intuition and less of just the algorithm and the computation of how do you do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> <expression> and <expression> components are the partials with respect to <expression> with respect to <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youll hopefully never forget it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its even more fun when you have the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what are the components of the del operator its the partial derivative with respect to <expression> the partial derivative with respect to <expression> partial derivative with respect to  right let me just rewrite the del operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we just have to simplify it taking a bunch of partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can view it as being  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now minus the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the second where were taking this operator cross the vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh and sorry when you take the determinant you use that and this is all kind of a bit of voodoo but you put a plus here a minus here a plus here so its kind of this checkered pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> and then were going to have all of that thats the magnitude in our idirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now whats the magnitude of our curl in the jdirection lets cross out the row in the column of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we said that you can view the curl of this vector field and i have no intuition of what this vector field looks like i just made this up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and essentially we could just i dont have to rewrite it we can just multiply this by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the derivative of this with respect to y its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me start over actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "erase that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the magnitude in the jdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say our vector field and ill do a three dimensional vector field just to do a fairly complicated example im just going to make it up on the fly so lets say in the xdirection the magnitude of the field is i dont know lets say its <expression> in the xdirection plus i dont know lets make it <expression> in the jdirection or the ydirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "to this is <expression> this should actually be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you have a little intuition now of what the curl is", "entities": []}
{"text": "one that i have trouble visualizing but that we can mathematically chug through", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a partial with respect to <expression> of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just literally take the cross product of that del operator and your vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well write <expression> and lets put the minus out front these are whats multiplied", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are the components of the vector field ill probably run out of space but its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the partial of this with respect to <expression> lets put the minus out front <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is just a constant so it just carries over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and then we have minus now we stick the partial with respect sorry actually i forgot to do this part", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that should be oh there we go minus this expression the partial of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the partial with respect to <expression> and now were on to our <expression> component plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the zdirection i dont know lets make it <expression> in the zdirection", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats how you calculate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats our new vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i had a little stick here id be pushing in this direction with not that much of a magnitude in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the difference in magnitudes of these <expression> you could almost view them as the torque producing forces the difference in magnitude is enough that youd still have the same counterclockwise rotation here as you would have here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets do a little experiment", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the curl at any point of this vector field is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if that makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was our old graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "or nothing would be entering into that circle or in any given amount of time the concentration of that circle wouldnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "which would have meant that we would have had no rotation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this term lets see partial derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just because i have <expression> minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even though this looks like a two dimensional vector field we actually have to take the cross product in <expression> dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were done analyzing this vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the  ink  kind of holds", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> component is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually you could put a twig anywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "make the window bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would have the forces or the fluids pushing in in this direction but theyre not helping to rotate and pushing out in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats not going to help me either", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats pretty neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of the if you think of it as force or velocity of the vector field is going to be applying translation to objects in that field", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me actually change it to my new vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where we are in the <expression> coordinate and the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we do have some fluid or particles coming in at a certain velocity from the bottom right and the top left", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now ive run of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then id be pushing down to the right in this direction so it would cause it to spin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know you cant read it but thats that <expression> there and thats the <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i put a twig in the center or some kind of stick in the center lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "or partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the curl of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im definitely not going to rotate there", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the torques must be just perfectly offsetting each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus the partial derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "for example if i put a twig here its going to be pushed outward by the flow of the water by the velocity of the water", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the divergence of this field is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the partial derivative with respect to <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually just for fun lets think about the divergence of that field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be  well see the <expression> component lets cross out its column and its row", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "why dont we just cross all of that out and that makes intuitive sense too right because at least from <expression> point of view the rotation is although the rotation if you think about it is going to be in the direction perpendicular to both the <expression> direction and perpendicular to the direction in which it is changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one should be a little bit cleaner to calculate than the last example", "entities": []}
{"text": "as far as <expression> concerned <expression> is also constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all of that times <expression> minus and now its going to be the <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "so because the curl is a constant positive number when we look at <expression> plane like this if you put a twig that same twig anywhere where you put it on this plane itll have the same counterclockwise rotation", "entities": []}
{"text": "where youre not going to have any rotation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  our del vector operator cross <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in the middle it definitely makes sense that something is spinning", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first lets just chuck through this and figure out its curl", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the curl is <expression> everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you were to stick something especially in the middle its very clear that it would spin", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know it wouldnt spin as much", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do the divergence of this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe a twig might be pushed in a direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "the curl is the same throughout this entire vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what might be a little unintuitive you might think wow well wouldnt something spin faster near the center than it would here why is the you know the curl we got is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its not going to rotate", "entities": []}
{"text": "if that confuses you dont worry about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this was <expression> then this would have been <expression> then this final term we would have taken the partial derivative with respect to <expression> and so this would have been <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and does that make sense well if we take a circle anywhere here lets take it in the center because the centers the most interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "cross out its row and column the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> component is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the bottom left im also pushing up and to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what this vector field looks like and lets see if that gives us if our intuition holds in this example", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats its <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what happens if i were to change", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could kind of view it orthogonally to its direction of motion which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember you do plus minus plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you take the cross product you still have to do it in <expression> dimensions", "entities": []}
{"text": "row and column", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be perpendicular to both of these vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is nothing but this", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase this real fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i had an infinitesimally small circle or sphere in this vector field i would have no net density increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally plus its <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "or the partial derivative of the  vector  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually this is called an irrotational i think thats the word vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i have the vector field <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well as far as <expression> concerned <expression> is a constant so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i were to draw a circle here because the divergence is 0 its telling us that whatevers coming in in 1 direction is coming out in the other directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if both of these only have <expression> and <expression> components your actual result is going to be in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is the same thing as our <expression> dot our vector field <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets simplify it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because a curl is just like torque and when you like we did the right hand rule when we studied well i hope you watched some of the videos on magnetism and torque but the torque actually goes in a direction that is perpendicular to both of the vectors in your cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the partial derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even in the other case when this was a minus it still would have been <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all were left is with this last term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me try to make it a little bit bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to think about the divergence of that field its fairly easy to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i think its clear you know right when you look at it that this vector field looks like its spinning", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then our curl would have been <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what would have happened if this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill simplify it above it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so minus and this is the <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have no <expression> component", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is our vector field <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatevers coming in through here and here is leaving through there and there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im not getting any denser or any less dense", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway lets simplify this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and thats true pretty much anywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus and then my magnitude in the <expression> direction is dependent on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus the partial derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but just as much is coming out through the top right and the bottom left", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what if i had that same stick here youd say well on the top right im pushing up up and to the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats even though i kind of have curl in the <expression> direction or i have curl in the y direction theyre offsetting each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youll be like whoa thats kind of implying that the field is making something spin equally no matter where you are in the field", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the intuition of that well if we just look at it mathematically if we have <expression> curl somehow the rotation in our <expression> direction must be being offset by a rotation in the y direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if it doesnt then you could apply the same argument to the <expression> vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "the vector at any given point  minus or the magnitude of my <expression> direction is actually dependent on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if that makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that in <expression> dimensions i actually end up having no rotation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have no divergence or convergence", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always fun to just interpret a vector field to death", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> partial with respect to <expression> partial with respect to <expression> partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which implies or which means that i could put a twig anywhere here and im not going to get any kind of rotation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just do that experiment", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it would", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the divergence of that vector field is just a partial derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we write that its the definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what if and im just going to draw an abstract surface here let me draw some axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we had a well actually let me go the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "not <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i had some constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets call that you know this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can kind of view it as the domain", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now before our domain was just at least you know for most of what we dealt with was just the xaxis or kind of the real number line in the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this line right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "some surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives us the area of this blue sheet", "entities": []}
{"text": "if its not you might want to review the definite integration videos", "entities": []}
{"text": "but hopefully youll now see the parallel of how we extend this to taking the volume under a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think youre going to find out that actually calculating the volumes are pretty straightforward especially when you have fixed <expression> and <expression> bounds", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my zaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a constant <expression> a line like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just show you what a surface looks like in case you dont remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would be the volume of that sliver the volume of that sliver will be this function of <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "give me an <expression> and ill give you a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have a constant <expression> it would be a line like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would give us an expression so that i would know the area of this kind of sliver of the volume for any given value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i pick a <expression> there itll be a different area", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just draw something", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far weve used integrals to figure out the area under a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the intuition behind the definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i wanted to figure out the area under this curve between lets say <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> a very small change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats my yaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i have some function this is the <expression> plane thats the xaxis thats the yaxis and i have some function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if we integrated it from <equation> which was back here all the way to <equation> what would it look like it would look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make a square bound first because this keeps it a lot simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "say here ill put it into the function and itll give us a <expression> value now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets just review a little bit of the intuition although this should hopefully be second nature to you at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we wanted to take the sum of all of these rectangles right theres just going to be a bunch of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "im making that that little cut that i took the area of by making it three dimensional", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what were going to try to figure out the volume of", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you give me a <expression> i can tell you the area of the sliver that corresponds to that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now our domain is the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what could i do if i know the area of any given sliver what if i multiply the area of that sliver times <expression> this is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this would actually give us a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have the area in between it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the sum or the areas that were summing up are going to be the height is <expression> and the width is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just call the base of this rectangle <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to take the sums of these rectangles from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well actually figure out the volume under this surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i had some sliver", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the height is going to be a function of the <expression> i have and the <expression> i picked", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have to specify bounds right from here we said <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to make them infinitely small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure out the volume under a surface like this how do we figure out the volume it seems like a bit of a stretch given what weve learned from this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the <expression> direction this is the <expression> direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for some constant <expression> what if i could just figure out the area under the curve there how would i figure out just the area under that curve itll be a function of which y i pick right because if i pick a <expression> here itll be a different area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just a little bit of review", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the domain or the region not the domain the region of the <expression> and <expression> region of this part of the surface under which we want to calculate the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then itll pop out another number and if we wanted to graph it itll be our height", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can write a surface as instead of <expression> is a function of <expression> im sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i multiplied this area times a small <expression> then all of a sudden i have a sliver of volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway i didnt want to confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "it depends which <expression> and <expression> we pick down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont practice these videos ahead of time so im often wondering what im about to draw", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is going from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that could be the height of a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the height of this rectangle is going to be <expression> at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the intuition of what were going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "where you could review thats maybe <expression> of the rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "this little area that im shading right here gets depth of that sheet", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could have my <expression> let me pick a vibrant color so you can see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it gets some depth", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see thats my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "one there one there", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that this is <expression>  i dont know thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the area of the rectangle is just base times height right well were going to make these rectangles really skinny and just sum up an infinite number of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it would be we said the height of each of these rectangles is <expression> right thats the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just want to give you the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me try my best to draw this neatly", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is our surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its width is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i could view this now as a very similar problem to this one up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in a vibrant color", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i do is i split it up into a bunch of columns or a bunch of rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an arbitrary <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know lets say", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we had a constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression> of if this is <expression> or whatever you can just call it <expression> right thats the height of that rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> thats <expression> and thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its part of its a sheet of paper within this volume you can kind of view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what were going to do in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we figure out the volume under this well if i just wanted to figure out the area of lets just say this sliver", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill plot it there and itll be a point on the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the area i want to figure out", "entities": []}
{"text": "then well get the area and if we have infinite number of these rectangles and theyre infinitely skinny we have exactly the area under that curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully that makes some sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can give any <expression> and any <expression> and well just deal with the reals right now i dont want to get too technical", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of saying that <expression> is a function of <expression> we can write a surface as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say i have some surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we want to figure out is the volume under the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "although im assuming to some degree that thats a constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the height is a function of where we are in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you its function in a second but its pretty neat to look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example you give me a coordinate in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would be the area of this sheet of paper its kind of a constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i added all of those sheets that now have depth if i took the infinite sum so if i took the integral of this from my lower <expression> bound from <expression> to my upper <expression> bound <expression> then at least based on our intuition here maybe i will have figured out the volume under this surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say thats <expression> right thats a change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all what is a surface well if were thinking in <expression> dimensions a surface is going to be a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as you can see its a server", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see let me rotate it to its traditional form", "entities": []}
{"text": "right the domain is all of the set of valid things that you can input into a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "what are the bounds you can almost view what are the bounds of the domain well lets say that this point lets say that this right here thats <expression> <expression> in the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say the shadow if the sun was right above the surface the shadow would be right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its like a piece of paper thats bent", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i multiply this whole thing times <expression> i get this volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that this line right here is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where let me draw one of those rectangles where you could view and theres different ways to do this but this is just a review", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say so if we wanted to draw it in the <expression> plane like you can kind of view the projection of the surface of the <expression> plane or the shadow of the surface of the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "fair enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope you get that right this is the <expression> plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "why didnt i substitute it the other way around why didnt i say this why didnt i say that this <expression> is <expression> and why didnt i say this <expression> is <expression> well as you can see this would have been useless right because then i cant multiply it times a <expression> and it gets all confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we can make our substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why was my problem that i gave you silly well i could have simplified this before even doing the substitution right i could have said that thats the same thing as the integral of <expression> which is the same thing as the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "i keep using that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually its good that it by substitution because this probably wouldnt have been completely intuitive for you to do just yet as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well continue doing it with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we can say then that <expression> and we know that <expression> as well which is once again mind blowing", "entities": []}
{"text": "you raise exponent <expression> and thats the same thing as <expression> or we could view that as <expression> and of course plus <expression> at the end", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "dx", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this as we see simplifies to the <expression> and that that  lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this is <expression> right i just switched the orders", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you know every now and then you have to bear with me", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "and then i multiply that times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just  <expression> which is this right here right we just set <expression> to  this expression <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to switch the orders of these <expression> around no different", "entities": []}
{"text": "well once again we have this expression <expression> and whats the derivative of <expression> well the derivative of <expression> as we learned which is <expression> of these things that amazes me is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do a couple more problems like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "image clear image image invert", "entities": []}
{"text": "that looks complicated to you doesnt it well just like we said this is a pattern like we saw in the previous examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make the substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually thats <expression> definition for <expression> is number which when its raised to the <expression> power its the derivative of the same expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> and this <expression> actually do cancel out and youre left with that this  the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats <expression> well we just showed <expression> is just <expression> right so its times <expression> and then we have times <expression> right and i know youre probably not too comfortable with the differentials at this point but they behave in just the way regular numbers do with a fraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what we said at the beginning", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and while we know that the answer of this integral this  <expression> and then of course we should add the plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we can now do is substitute these <expression> things into this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is an easy integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do it up here to make it extra messy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the integral of this well this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do things in the wrong order", "entities": []}
{"text": "i might do another presentation where i do slightly harder problems using this same technique", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think we have time for <expression> more", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this expression here <expression> and well whats the derivative of this <expression> well its <expression> right notice that im engineering it so it works cleanly but most textbooks and tests tend to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just <expression> right because this is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just  <expression> right plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway i dont want to confuse you too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we rewrite this top integral this is just  i wont switch this time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the integral now becomes instead of writing <expression> we can write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say to the minus third power", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> right <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "are we done well i mean almost but it would be nice to just take that <expression> and unwind it and put the <expression> back in for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will also switch colors just to keep things interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we have a <expression> that we can use and then we have its derivative right so we can say <equation> and we can say then the derivative of <expression> we know the derivative of <expression> is <expression> right because the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do <expression> more", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "done", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only thing different than what you might have seen recently is that instead of an <expression> we have a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can just unwind this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway thats integration by substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually this might be an easier way to think about these type of integrals than what i did in the last presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i just realized i constructed a very silly problem for you because you could simplify this before even doing it with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know youre not completely comfortable yet with even this integration notation why is this <expression> sitting there in the first place but when we do the definite integrals it will make more sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know what youre thinking sal", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway you see if you did it in this way it becomes very complicated so we dont want to do it like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is just  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of this to the sixth power plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just something you memorize", "entities": []}
{"text": "you always want to move from something thats complicated to something thats simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we want to take the indefinite integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if we were to integrate both sides of this equation because were still doing algebra on some levels anything you do to <expression> side of the equation you can do to the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can make this a minus we can make this a minus sign of <expression> and make this a plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> simplifies things a lot", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well everything we have in our integration tool kit so far i dont think help us here right because we dont have a function and its derivative so we cant do substitution or which is the same thing as the reverse chain rule this isnt a simple polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent proven it to you yet but its usually in the inside cover of your calculus book", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression> it was the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we always in math in general you always want to simplify", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the intuition and let me just solve through it and hopefully itll make a little bit more sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of <expression> well yeah its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did i just do it looks like i just well i am just essentially playing with the product rule from differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess if you have this in your tool kit and actually you have it beyond the exam on this type of integral and you actually keep it and you retain it then you i think will become an integration jock", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of <expression> we can ignore this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all i did", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i assume that <expression> and <expression> is <expression> then <expression> this yellow term let me write it in yellow just for fun so <expression> so im saying that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same exact thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont even have to look it up", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just move forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not making it any more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for indefinite integration part v im not going to do a presentation on a type of integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "see im saying that <expression> is <expression> and im saying that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to take the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say <expression> is <expression> right im sorry <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think you would agree that weve now simplified this a good bit because this is just the integral of <expression> right so this is just  <expression> this is just this first term right here minus and whats the integral of <expression> well the derivative of well let me make it even simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an introduction to integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i already said that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you encounter this when youre doing integrals kind of the last tool kit and this is pretty sophisticated is to do integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this might seem a little bit arbitrary and it is a little bit arbitrary let me take well i could take either of these but let me just take this <expression> and move it to this side of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this can be a little confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill show you where this is useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway let me show you what im talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i had <expression> functions lets say <expression> and i wanted to take the derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now its really easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we could say this so let me change colors because this could get confusing this term right here we could say that term <expression>  this term let me switch back to the yellow  <expression> minus this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to subtract this term from both sides of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason why i knew <expression> is <expression> is because i said the derivative i said <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the derivative of <expression> well we said <expression> is <expression> right so the derivative is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i like this more because it naturally makes more sense to me", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we also want to take the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we should never forget the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but when you do calculus its been about fifteen years since i learned it and i just remember integration by parts is just really a derivation of the product rule and that gets me back to the format", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression> which is just as complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason why im going to assume that <expression> is <expression> and im going to assume <expression> is <expression> is because later we want to take the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might want to memorize it for the exam because its faster for when you take the ap exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually well im running out of space but ill write it in the corner right down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i can use it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do and you might view this as well sal how did you know to do this and ill tell you my thought process actually after i show you what i did", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just used the product rule to derive this formula for integration by parts and in a lot of calculus books they do this <expression> and <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you probably wondering well sal this is all nice and it looks fancy but what good is this going to do me well what i essentially just did is i kind of proved this you could call this a formula but i often forget it especially once i havent done it a long time and then i actually just reprove it to myself just by remembering the product rule but this is called integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the chain rule just told us that this is just the same thing as lets say the derivative of the first function <expression> times the second function <expression> plus now the first function <expression> times the derivative of the second function", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope you understand what im saying", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill show you where im going with this in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next presentation i will do a bunch of examples well as many as i can fit in to <expression> minutes of actually using integration by parts to solve fairly fancy integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this situation we could assume that <expression> is <expression> and we could assume that <expression> is <expression> or we could assume the other way around", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i put it onto this side of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write it separately here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually try it the other way around and youll see that if you took the antiderivative of <expression> you would get something thats more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this is minus the integral of the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just remember what the product rule of differentiation was", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so how can we use this for integration by parts well integration by parts tells us that if we have an integral where we have a function and then the derivative of another function then we could use this formula to hopefully simplify it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know if the function if the derivative of a function is cosine then we know the function itself is sine", "entities": []}
{"text": "its easier for me to read and i can derive at any time just from the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we were to integrate both sides well if you integrate this side youre taking the integral of a derivative you just get back to what you took the derivative originally of so this just becomes <expression> and then we have to integrate the right hand side well that just becomes and were doing the indefinite integral kind of the antiderivative but we can use this tool when we do definite integrals as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i dont have to necessarily memorize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if youre seeing it on an exam you know its a solvable integral and if you cant solve it any other way its probably integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me try to stay color consistent", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont want to forget my dxs", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know that if i take the derivative of <expression> that simplifies it", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its probably a good idea to say that <expression>  its probably let me change colors its probably a good idea to make <expression>  <expression> because later im going to take the derivative of it and the derivative of it simplifies it and its probably a good idea to make <expression> <expression> because later im going to take the antiderivative of it and the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats minus the integral of the derivative of the first function", "entities": []}
{"text": "but once again when i look at this im like well how do i solve this i cant use the integration by substitution because theres not an embedded function and then i have the derivative of it sitting right next to it so", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres <expression> and then this minus you distribute it so it becomes a plus so then its plus <expression> i just took the minus i multiplied it times this minus so i got a <expression> and then the antiderivative of <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "pretty fancy no weve figured out the antiderivative the indefinite integral of <expression> is this big fancy thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "it actually turns out youll just have to do this many many many many times but every time you do integration by parts that the exponent on the xterm just becomes smaller and smaller and smaller until you get to something thats really easy to integrate and then you can do it and youll have kind of this big long expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can kind of keep reverting back to the top formula if you get confused", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if that is the case that this integral is going to  because we have the minus sign out front this minus sign out front this integral is going to  <expression> where <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe not soon but in the next couple of weeks on just a lot of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "were kind of doing integration by parts within integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "i bet you before listening to this video you would never imagine that you could tackle integration like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "just so and its a little messy", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i would try to see is there the derivative of something of <expression> function of kind of a composite function here so i can do the reverse chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the integral of <expression> or the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression> right so lets write that", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember were kind of doing a new problem within the original big problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and really once you know that you should use integration by parts i think youll find that its not that hard to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i took the antiderivative of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say let me do it separately lets assume i think you getting a little bit of the hang of it along the same vein that this is <expression> that this is <expression> and that this is <expression> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> i dont want you to think that im somehow putting <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i go into this term right here im going to have to pick up my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then from that we subtract the integral we take the derivative of <expression> so you get <expression> and then times the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it just says that if we have an integral of <expression> so if you see within the integral sign <expression> function and then you see the derivative of another function and i think with practice integration by parts is really a bit of an art", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> here is <expression> so i cant do anything here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in real life it might be an unsolvable integral and youd have to use a computer or some other technique", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way i think about the chain rule is i want to simplify it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just write the formula for integration by parts and if you ever forget it i mean it doesnt hurt to memorize it but if you ever forget it you just really have to just derive it from the product rule of differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "just so we dont lose track of our original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i saw this out of the blue and i didnt know that this was a presentation on the integration by parts i would first clearly this isnt a polynomial so i cant just do a simple polynomial antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont like this color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to rewrite everything weve done it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it might be tedious it might be hairy but at least you have a tool kit or you have something in your tool kit that you can tackle integral problems like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive taken the antiderivative it just happens to be the same function", "entities": []}
{"text": "interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> but <expression> is still just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to pick my <expression> out of probably <expression> of these <expression> functions so that the <expression> is simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can try <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> were saying <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i need to pick my <expression> i would guess that either <expression> is going to be my <expression> or <expression> is going to be my <expression> and i want to pick that so that when i take the antiderivative of it its going to be simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually let me write out the whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i think you see where were going", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it looks like ive simplified it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "this integral looks easier to solve than this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i use the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just do some problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "or at least not more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually i should probably stay at least keep the colors kind of consistent so you know what im hopefully doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we said <expression> now dont get confused were saying <expression> let me write it in a corner down here were saying that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the hard part is to recognize when you should use integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i also know that the and once again this is <expression> of my to me a very mind blowing idea but that the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i think we have an integral that is pretty straightforward to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill probably do <expression> more video on integration by parts just because i think this is <expression> of the harder concepts to really grasp and feel comfortable with and then ill try to do a bunch of examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the integral of we could take this <expression> out of this and i think it becomes pretty obvious whats the integral of <expression> this is a scratchout this says <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could actually try <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see if we can apply this", "entities": []}
{"text": "from my point of view its kind of my last resort or once you have a lot of practice you might recognize well if theres an <expression> in it or if theres a trig function in it and i cant do the reverse chain rule or integration by substitution then integration by parts is probably my best option assuming im seeing this on an exam and not in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "the example using <expression> might be a little complicated because its hard to tell whether ive taken the derivative or not", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we assume what im doing is right then what did we say well here we just multiply the <expression> real functions right so when i say the real functions i mean not the derivatives of <expression> to <expression> of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the <expression> is <expression> you take the antiderivative its still <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "our <expression> this is <expression> now", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im now going to do just a bunch of integration by parts problems as many as i can do in <expression> minutes without confusing you", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not systematic thats <expression> that  <expression> of access times <expression> this is how its the product rule in reverse minus the integral of the derivative of the first function <expression> times the second function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then of course we should never forget the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to mix it up so that hopefully you can get a sense of how i try to figure out which of my integration tools i should use for a certain problem when i see the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the antiderivative of the second function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not going to become any more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i need to do integration by parts again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course if <equation> then <expression> is also  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i want to take the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it kind of easy to memorize because theres this symmetry to the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> and then i would take the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the antiderivative of this function is once again just <expression> and then f times that function unchanged time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "although we could do this problem the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the original problem <expression>  and now let me switch back to this color it  <expression> and then i can just this parentheses doesnt matter because im just adding everything in the parentheses <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should actually do some integration by parts problems without <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take integration by parts again see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the integral of <expression> you probably never heard of someone call a math problem a classic but hopefully i will instill in you this love for mathematics and you will also consider this to be a classic problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "which doesnt really make a difference because whenever i take the antiderivative of it to <expression> it stays the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is <expression> whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so integration by parts as we take the original functions <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its just a fun problem to see because one its the example a lot of people use sometimes even a trick problem thats given on a really hard math exam or if you go to calculus competitions like i used to in high school", "entities": []}
{"text": "it seems like i just keep adding terms making it more and more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just use <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write it out this is very exciting its the home stretch", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same thing happens when you take the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully i havent confused you too much", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i also think is cool is even if you just look at this solution its kind of neat right the antiderivative of <expression> and actually never forget the plus <expression> that wouldve given me minus <expression> point on the exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that <expression> is <expression> because <expression> literally doesnt change", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i want to subtract the indefinite integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you might already see where im going with this because these are both fun functions because <expression> you can take the derivative you could take the antiderivative and it still stays <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im now going to do it integration by parts problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "i actually took the antiderivative of it but its the same exact thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats a pretty neat property and you might want to graph them and play with them but its kind of neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same as this which are both the antiderivative of this although they are all the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we actually never even have to evaluate this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if were getting anywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "one <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill experiment doing it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know its really messy", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take <expression> antiderivatives you get back to the negative of itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you take <expression> derivatives you get back to the negative of itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me use a new color", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also a pretty cool function and i think you can start to see how integration by parts might be cool here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to switch colors i dont like this blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could put the minus here thatll make it look messy i could put the minus here thatll make it messy or i could just put minus here and make these minuses cancel out and i get a plus here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats pretty neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say we want to take the integral its a bit of a classic", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats kind of cool <expression> is this expression thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to write this first part <expression> plus and now lets do integration by parts again", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same thing as this just a minus right so were going to do something what i think to be fairly cool", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway this is just a fun integration by parts problem because you actually never have to evaluate the final integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully i have convinced you that is a classic of a problem and you also find it neat and ill see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "not to make myself too i was actually not that geeky as a high school student but i have to admit i was a mathlete", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can think about why that happened right because these trick functions cycle", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not as cool as <expression> it doesnt stay exactly the same but it kind of cycles", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we had to do integration by parts twice to get back to where we were before", "entities": []}
{"text": "see anything interesting exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you might think that i arbitrarily switched colors here when i rewrote this but if you look you might see why i actually did switch colors here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order to see if were getting anywhere let me just rewrite the whole thing and maybe get rid of these parenthesis because its just a plus so we can get rid of the parenthesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wouldnt be surprised if your math teacher does the same problem for you just to show you integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "for this round of integration by parts this was <expression> but now for this around im going to assume its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just the same thing as <expression> times the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whenever i do integration by parts i always like to assume that this is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i have to do now to solve this integral is divide both sides by <expression> and im done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once again we are not clear whether weve made any progress", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve gone from <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets add this term to both sides of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its neat how integration by parts allowed us to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the average of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so integration by parts tells us we take <expression> so i take this function and the antiderivative of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its like this cycle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take this and put it on this side of the equation what happens i then have <expression> of these on the left side equation so that becomes i mean i could write it out its <expression> plus right because im taking this and im putting it on that side of the equation <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take this and lets put it on to this side of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its very hard to keep track of what ive done here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just going to write on the right side of the  sign because this might get a little long", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we use that to solve it without actually having to evaluate the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "we said this integral is just the original problem again", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i divide both sides by <expression> i get and im going to try to write it so you can see everything <expression>  and on that side i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to assume that this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the antiderivative and this is also the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that  this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> you take the derivative you go to minus sign of <expression> you take the derivative again then you to <expression> then you take the derivative again then you get a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from that i subtract the integral of the antiderivative of this or i take <expression> which is <expression> and then the derivative of <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets assume this is <expression> and lets assume this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can view this as a <expression> or this negative divided by a negative theyre going to cancel out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> and then you want to divide by <expression> and ill do it explicitly here", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus one", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could rewrite this this  lets say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>  what whats the derivative of <expression> its not quite <expression> right its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre like wow this <expression> was just an <expression> or if it was just a <expression> this would be a really easy integral to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then of course this has the exact same form as this thing right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you kind of do see a pattern", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then up here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this it also be written as he wrote it in email so i dont know how he exactly saw it but it can also be written as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> right up there what is that  well we just solved for it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would just be the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general you know to do <expression> substitution or integration by substitution when you see something and you see its derivative sitting there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the same thing as <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it on the side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <equation> so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just multiplied both sides by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you increase your exponent by <expression> and then you divide by whatever your new exponent is", "entities": []}
{"text": "there we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when you divide this by <expression> you get this minus out front and then of course youd have the plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets rewrite this original problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then here we do the same thing we did up here although now we have a minus out front that actually makes it a little bit cleaner", "entities": []}
{"text": "you increase the exponent by <expression> and then you multiply by what your new exponent is", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets multiply both sides of this by a <expression> and you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same thing as the antiderivative of <expression> and we know how to take the antiderivative of something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know how to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i know im running out of space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we say <expression> and lets take the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for another usubsitution example evan from norway has asked me to do another <expression> substitution problem and i like these because it gets my momentum going for doing other things that maybe take a little bit more preparation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you would  let me do the  increasing the exponent <expression> youd increase the exponent youd get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes its written like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what was our substitution that we started with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "to take the antiderivative we raise <expression> it was to the <expression> power lets raise it to <expression> power higher than that so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you had this negative that was sitting out there before so that negative is still going to be there", "entities": []}
{"text": "where this <expression> is you have a cosine there and then we have cosines derivative there", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know how to do this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we can multiply both sides by <expression> and you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we want to substitute for this here we have a minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be <expression> im sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever is easier for you to conceptualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we could get it in a form that looks like this wed be all set", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that we can replace with this minus du", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me rewrite it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now this integral becomes and the denominator instead of <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats  minus du", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the problem he sent me and i hope i pronounced his name right was the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little bit less ambiguous", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <equation> this thing  <expression>  the antiderivative of our original problem which was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "either way i like looking at this a bit better", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so youre just left with <expression> to the <expression> or <expression> is the antiderivative oh sorry were not done yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youd decrease the exponent by <expression> you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this integral would be easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> right we made that definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course youre going to have a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont believe it take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just the antiderivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have our substitution to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the big clue that we should be using <expression> substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what were going to do is were going to substitute <expression> for <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "and lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could have rewritten this top integral we could have rewritten it like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just writing it a bunch of different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "keep that in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually if you look at it i mean you could just eyeball it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets look at this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me graph that as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "right this is the velocity so say we had over this very small change in time we have this roughly constant velocity thats on this graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let actually use an example from physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write this in the corner", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> and then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a horrible line", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case the object started at position of <expression> but it could be you know at any constant right you could have started here and then curved up", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wont draw it that steep because im going to use this for an illustration", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the purposes of this lecture you cant go back in time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its actually a pretty steep line", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this roughly constant velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know why the convention is to use s as the variable for distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me switch to something more pleasant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just a formula that tells us the position kind of how far has something gone after <expression> many lets say seconds right so after like <expression> seconds we would have gone lets say the distance is in feet this is in seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i guess if you view it the other way if you have the velocity its antiderivative is distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can kind of view this as a very small change in time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you have to distance formula its derivative is just velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to find the change the instantaneous change with respect to time of this formula right because this is the distance formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll get pretty close to as you can imagine the area under this curve or in this case a line", "entities": []}
{"text": "its slightly better", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want to figure out what the distance is after you know <expression> seconds right so this is the taxis this is the velocity axis right so lets say we were only given this and lets say we didnt know that the antiderivative of the velocity function is the distance function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how much time goes by", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that <expression>  i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this presentation i actually want to show you how we can use the antiderivative to figure out the area under a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we draw the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have a constant this red is kind of bloody", "entities": []}
{"text": "skinny and tall right its almost infinitely skinny but its were assuming for these purposes it has some very notional amount of width", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually im going to focus more a little bit more on the intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should switch back to let me write that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me undo that too because i just want to do it for <expression> right because you cant really go back in time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the distance that the object travels over the small time would be the small time times the velocity right it would be whatever the value of this red line is times the width of this distance right so whats another way visually i kind of did it ahead of time but whats happening here if i take this change in time right which is kind of the base of this rectangle and i multiply it times the velocity which is really just the height of this rectangle what have i figured out well i figured out the area of this rectangle right right the velocity this moment times the change in time at this moment is nothing but the area of this very skinny rectangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have over any small period of time right or if we have a constant velocity when you have a constant velocity distance is just velocity times time right so lets say we had a very small time fragment here right ill draw it big but lets say this time fragment it is really small", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this curve will essentially just be a parabola right itll look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we know the instant rate of change of distance with respect to time well know the velocity right so <expression> <expression>  so whats the derivative here its <expression> right and this is the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you can actually view it as instantaneous", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me take do it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it would also get you pretty much the exact amount of distance youve traveled after <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats actually <expression> of the initial uses of what made derivatives so useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill use distance and velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this ill draw it in red this is this going to be a line right <expression> its a line with slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i think im running into the <expression> minute wall so im just going to pause here and im going to continue this in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what if we wanted to figure out what the velocity of this object right this is lets see this is <expression> this is <expression> right and this is i dont know if its clear but this is kind of <expression> a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway lets just assume we started at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets graph this function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all that says", "entities": []}
{"text": "after <expression> seconds we would have gone <expression> feet", "entities": []}
{"text": "its pretty straight", "entities": []}
{"text": "after <expression> seconds right well then all we would have to do is we would have to just figure we would just do a bunch of <expression>s right youd do another <expression> here youd figure out the area of this column youd figure out the area of this column the area of this column right because each of these areas of each of these columns represents the distance that the object travels over that <expression> right so if you wanted to know how far you traveled after <expression> seconds youd essentially get or an approximation would be the sum of all of these areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of distance is velocity the antiderivative of velocity is distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "im doing pretty good", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is that graph and this is distance right so in case you hadnt learned already and maybe ill do a whole presentation on kind of using calculus for physics and using derivatives for physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "what would the velocity be well the velocity is just whats velocity its distance divided by time right and since this velocity is always changing we want to figure out the instantaneous velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "the object every second you go its going a little bit further right so its actually accelerating", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thatll have to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "have to use the line tool might have better luck", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually this could be a good review for derivatives or actually an application of derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "graph it", "entities": []}
{"text": "how would we figure out how would we figure out what the distance would be at any given time well lets think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this will actually be a fairly straightforward graph to draw", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there we figured out the area of this column right well if we wanted to figure out the distance that you travel after lets say you know i dont know lets say <expression> lets say <expression> right this is just a particular <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we have a very small change of time and over that very small change in time we have a roughly constant velocity lets say the roughly constant velocity is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so s is distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that i described the position of something moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets assume that we were only given this graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way ive used <expression> is like its like a change in time thats unbelievably small right so its like almost instantaneous but not quite", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know why i switched colors but ill stick with the yellow", "entities": []}
{"text": "one would think well actually i know why wont they use <expression> because <expression> is the letter used for differential i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the distance function", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as you got more and more as you made the dts smaller and smaller skinnier skinnier skinnier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets called this very small time fragment let call this delta <expression> or <expression> actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "although you wont know where at what position the object started", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for introduction to definite integrals welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we said you know this is the graph of the velocity of some object", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you had more and more and more and more of these rectangles then your approximation will get pretty close to well <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where i left off we said that we had this i guess you could call it equation or this function although i didnt write it with the function notation where i said the distance  <expression> and i graphed it its like a parabola right for positive time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so and the way you evaluate an indefinite integral and let me show you that first is that you figure out the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tells us <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean well after <expression> seconds unintelligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats a way that you could start to try to approximate how far youve traveled after say <expression> seconds well  as i said  you graph this and you say lets assume over some change in time velocity is roughly constant right lets say velocity is right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so lets say we call this distance <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im running out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also the area under this curve is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we evaluate this at <expression> so <expression> right thats evaluated at <expression> and then we subtract it evaluate at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"text": "let me clear it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as these <expression>s approach <expression> the number of rectangles actually approach infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually maybe ill stick with this example but ill clear it a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it actually turns out that theyre the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could approximate how far you travel over that small change in time by multiplying that change in time lets say thats like you know a millionth of a second times the velocity at roughly that time or maybe even the average velocity over that time and youd get the distance youve traveled over that very small fraction of time right but if you look at it visually that also happens to be the area of this rectangle right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the velocity is always changing you cant just take the slope you actually have to take the derivative right so we took the derivative with respect to time of this function or this equation and we got <expression> and this is the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is the definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to take the sum of each of the heights the height at any given point which is the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we could actually figure it out too", "entities": []}
{"text": "right we start at <expression> feet and then we moved forward from there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im actually going to ill do that more rigorously later but i think its very important to get this intuitive feel of just what an integral is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you know all this stuff now", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway so going back to the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say you didnt know that you could just take the antiderivative lets say we didnt know this at all and lets say you didnt know that you could just take the antiderivative because we just showed that you know the derivative of distance is velocity so the antiderivative of velocity is distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "it isnt just this voodoo that happens to be there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the definite integral is literally and they never do this in math texts and thats what always kind of confused me is that you can kind of view it like a sum like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is where im going to teach you the indefinite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually thats how if you ever write a computer program to approximate an integral or approximate the area under a curve thats the way a computer program would actually do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so after <expression> seconds we would have gone <expression> feet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we evaluate this at <expression> and we evaluate it at <expression> and then we subtract the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say you couldnt just take the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i just looked at the clock", "entities": []}
{"text": "right and the way you evaluate this is you figure out the antiderivative and you really dont have to do the <expression> here so the antiderivative we know is <expression> right its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way you figure out the indefinite integral is you say and sometimes they wont write <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats actually how i view it", "entities": []}
{"text": "erasing might be a good option with this one since its fairly messy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we said is if you want to know how far you travel after <expression> seconds you just draw a bunch of these rectangles and you sum up the area right and you could imagine and you dont have to imagine its actually true the smaller the bases of these rectangles and the more of these rectangles you have the more accurate your approximation will be and youll approach <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so its very interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me continue this in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyll just say from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh thats ugly", "entities": []}
{"text": "the indefinite integral tells us <expression> things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the s or distance axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets use this to do a couple more examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just need space", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we graphed it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could have been a variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the actual indefinite integral says well this is a sum but its the limit as the bases of these rectangles get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and we have more and more and more of these rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the integral from this is now a definite integral extending from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the distance yeah well lets just say it looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the indefinite integral i dont know how comfortable you are with summation i remember the first time i learned calculus i wasnt that comfortable with summation but its really all the indefinite integral is is you can kind of view it as a sum right so now youll maybe understand a little bit more why this symbol looks kind of like a sigma", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tells us the area of the curve from <equation> to <equation> right it tells us this whole area and it also tells us how far the object has gone after <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ok so we have that indefinite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the formula for the velocity its <expression> and then im at times the base at each of these rectangles <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is something pretty interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say you start at some distance and then it goes off like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to know how far is this thing gone after <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this axis is of course time this axis maybe i shouldnt do <expression> because it looks so much like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just say let me continue with the problem actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets just call this you know i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill now do it more general actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was like well we want to figure out if we were given this if we were given just this and i asked you what is the distance that this object travels after time you know after <expression> seconds lets you know lets say this <equation> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of a sudden we see that the antiderivative is pretty darn similar to the area under the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> <expression> feet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we said well the velocity if we know the distance the velocity is just the change of the distance with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "as you can tell i dont plan much for these presentations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me give you another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually maybe i should erase", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually im going to do that right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll approach the area under this curve right almost the exact area under this curve and youd also get almost the exact value of the distance after say <expression> seconds in this case right but <expression> didnt have to be an exact number", "entities": []}
{"text": "its kind of the sum of each of these rectangles but its the limit as if these were discrete rectangles you could just do a sum and you could make the rectangle bases smaller and smaller and have more and more rectangles and just do a regular sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells us area and it also tells us the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw this twice once for the distance and once for its derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "from <equation> to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right were already familiar with it as an antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually i want to show you why we do this subtraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and please look it up so you can see properly drawn integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in this case the indefinite integral is just saying well im going to take the sum from <equation> right so from <equation> to lets say in this example <equation> right because i said <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i asked a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for definite integrals part ii welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually i think its silly that theyre taught as <expression> separate classes", "entities": []}
{"text": "right its going to look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just continuing on with hopefully giving you one how to actually solve indefinite integrals and also giving you a sense of why you solve it the way you do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just want to know how far do i travel between <equation> seconds and <equation> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre doing the exact same thing we did here when we actually had this graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me lower the volume because youre more important", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is just <expression> and thats what <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me stick to the old numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we did here right this is what we did here intuitively when we worked with distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "so interestingly enough if i just changed this from <expression> to <expression> and in general if you want to figure out the area under a curve from <expression> to <expression> its just the indefinite integral from <expression> to <expression> actually from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think youre starting to get a little intuition about why we evaluated that previous indefinite integral in the previous video the way we did", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess <expression> to <expression> depending on how you say it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case <expression> right if these werent <expression> and <expression> if this was just <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just figure out the antiderivative and we evaluated at <expression> and we evaluated at <expression> and then we subtract the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "this capital f is just the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "right to figure out how far i travelled between <equation> and <equation> i just say <expression> of <expression> minus <expression> of <expression> right how far did i go after <expression> seconds minus how far i already was after <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "we evaluated it at <expression> and you evaluated it at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh my phone is ringing", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill talk about that at another time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the derivative so let me just call that <expression> of <expression> i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill see you in the next presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "because time times a constant velocity  distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "so an easy way to do that is i could just evaluate this function at <equation> let me use a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way you evaluate this is you figure out the antiderivative of this inside function and then you evaluate the antiderivative at <expression> and then from that you subtract it out at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right i think actually this is the fundamental theorem of calculus but i dont want to throw out things without knowing for sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me graph that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i did all of this not to confuse you further but really just to give you an intuition of why <expression> why the antiderivative is the area under the curve and then <expression> why lets say that <expression> <expression> and then why we evaluate it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you evaluated it at <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so going back to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as you can see this also tells me the area between <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think actually the rate of acceleration if im not mistaken is actually called jerk but i might have to wikipedia that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might see this in your books", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we did these <expression> videos really just to give you or actually is this the third or the second just to give you an intuition of why this is because i think thats really important if youre ever going to really use calculus in your life or write a computer program or whatever", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just saying if i want to figure out the area under a curve from <expression> to <expression> of <expression> of <expression> that we figure out the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to go make sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets actually draw the derivative of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me clear this up and just rewrite that last thing i wrote but maybe a little bit cleaner", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> should be the larger one", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right im not looking for the total distance ive traveled", "entities": []}
{"text": "from <expression> to <expression> of this velocity function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that the distance s this time ill write it as a function lets say the distance is i said it started at <expression> so lets say its <expression> lets say this is actually a cubic function", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you evaluate it at <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so not only did i figure out the distance between how far i traveled from <expression> seconds to <expression> seconds i also figured out the area under this curve from <expression> seconds to <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of <expression> is just the derivative right because its the rate of change of distance with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> feet is how far i travelled between <expression> seconds and <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that <expression> with a big fat capital <expression>  actually let me do it a better way let me say that the derivative of big fat <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "your velocity doesnt really matter about where your starting position is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> and the constant disappears right so its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so this might be <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for definite integrals area under a curve part iii welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre not only accelerating your rate of acceleration is increasing", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next presentation ill use this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <equation> <expression> is <expression> <expression> its <expression> so the object has gone <expression> feet at <equation> right and then at <equation> the object has gone how far <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see i havent done math in a long time", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually pretty easy to use once you know how to use antiderivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write that in a different color because i think im making it messier", "entities": []}
{"text": "see youre actually learning a little physics while youre learning calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "im giving you all this based on intuition not necessarily what im reading", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i did this to give you an intuition of why this works and why the antiderivative is the area under a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway lets say that this is the distance and let me give you a formula actually for the distance just for fun", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case the antiderivative of this is <expression> and we evaluated at <expression> and we evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets graph this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its getting messy i could just evaluate this function at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that makes sense right because your velocity doesnt care about where you started off from right youre going to be the same velocity if you started from <expression> feet or if you started from <expression> feet", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say i wanted to know how far i travel between <equation> seconds and <equation> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because remember the area of each of these rectangles represents how far i traveled in that little amount of time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression> is <expression> and all were saying is that if we take the integral of small <expression> from <expression> to <expression> <expression> that this is big <expression> its antiderivative at <expression> minus the antiderivative at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just going to look like a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think thats often missing in some textbooks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if we just had this velocity graph if we didnt know all of this over here and i asked you the same question though", "entities": []}
{"text": "i said how far does this thing travel between <expression> seconds and <expression> seconds right well i could do it the way that we learned in the previous video where i draw a bunch of small rectangles each of a really small width and i multiply it times its instantaneous velocity at that exact moment right and then i sum up all of those rectangles look how pretty that is i sum up all of the rectangles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the next couple videos ill actually apply this to a bunch of problems and youll hopefully see that its a pretty straightforward thing to actually compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill get a pretty good approximation for how far ive travelled between <expression> and <expression> seconds", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think physics and calculus should just be <expression> fun <expression>hour class", "entities": []}
{"text": "b to a", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative and the antiderivative dont only apply to distance and velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "its gone <expression> feet", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i want to figure out the area between the curve and the xaxis from <equation> to i dont know <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we can do is maybe you want to pause it and think about it yourself we can figure out the area under the grey curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to shade it in", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> <expression> right they both intersect at <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might be confused right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "im now going to use definite integrals to figure out the areas under a bunch of curves and if we have time maybe even between some curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say i want to figure out the area under the curve between the curve and really the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so itll start at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is exactly how were going to do it in the next video because i have run out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me right down the fundamental theorem of calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "yintercept at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just the notation they use", "entities": []}
{"text": "but when you subtract here the constants will cancel out", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw a graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do a slight variation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us if this top line is true then the definite integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>  its antiderivative evaluated at <expression> minus its antiderivative evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why i actually said the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe im making a mistake with negative signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could square both sides or well actually this is the same thing as doing it by intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of this stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just mechanically compute it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets apply this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could pick an arbitrary <expression> right here and itll just cancel out", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of <expression> this just  the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive done worse", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course itll continue on this side as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even this point you could probably do it from intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think youll get the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "right this is just big <expression> right because i figured out the end this is big <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is true for both of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think that  <expression> correct i think so", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to evaluate that at <expression> and <expression> and were going to subtract out big <expression> of <expression> from big <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that my <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to figure out this area", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw again", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats actually a pretty nice looking kind of sideways parabola i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "draw the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we put <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "some coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have our answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you watched the last videos hopefully that hit the point home", "entities": []}
{"text": "im kind of running out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "because it is defined for negative numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know if im going to have time to do it in this video but ill try", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this  so if i evaluate <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that big <equation> right thats also like saying that the thats equivalent to saying that <expression>  the antiderivative of <expression> right well lets just that its <expression> of the possible antiderivatives of <expression> right because theres always a constant term here and youre not sure whether it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i know i said here that big f isnt the only antiderivative right because you could at any constant to this and that would also be the antiderivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a little bit not true but i think you get the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now well just mechanically compute because actually understanding it is a bit harder than just doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then from that well subtract big <expression> right minus big <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but not to be confused with small cursive <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we will now use the fundamental theorem of calculus and hopefully you have an intuition of why this works and how the integral is really just a sum of a bunch of little little small squares with infinitely small bases", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll just be a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know i covered it really fast in the last presentation", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops i was doing well and then something happened", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its just <expression> we could say <expression> or <expression> right the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you figure out the antiderivative and you say where youre going to evaluate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we dont have to worry about <expression> because were going to subtract out the <expression>s", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just <expression> of the antiderivatives of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "squared units", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would have been very difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is what thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to subtract that right so if im subtracting <expression> its the same thing as adding <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could figure out this area and then we could figure out the entire area under the green curve separately and then we could subtract the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is actually going to look something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the area i want to figure out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it really doesnt matter which of the constants you pick", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> squared units", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think its pretty obvious that the only places where <equation> are the points <equation> which you already know and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could write this as a mixed number as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is big <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could figure out this area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is why people tend to use this standard because we know that <expression> is the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could imagine before you knew calculus figuring out an area of something with a curve its kind of top boundary", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is more algebra so i wont go into that in too much detail", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to figure out this is a boundary right between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "look how straight that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are essentially just going to figure out the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway my question to you or my question to myself really is what is the area between the curves where they intersect what is this what is this area well the first thing you have to figure out is just what are the boundary points what is this point and what is this point well this point i think is pretty clear", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you dont i guess want to do it through intuition you could just set these <expression> equations  each other right you could say <equation> right and then you could do a bunch of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say i have another function", "entities": []}
{"text": "just to make sure you understand this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can kind of view this as big <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to figure out the area between these <expression> curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "the last couple presentations were really to give you an intuition for this exact formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually its <expression> whatever units", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see how good i can draw this", "entities": []}
{"text": "not perfect but itll do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i always try", "entities": []}
{"text": "the constant actually doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this big <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> and then <expression> right so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "hope i didnt confuse you", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is that thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then multiply that by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats kind of neat", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just want to make a point", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just a fraction problem there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats a function thats a line that just goes straight at <equation> i think i just gave you the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually instead of doing this i think you could see that theres symmetry here so we could just figure out this area and multiply by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets figure out the entire area under <expression> from <expression> to <expression> and we can subtract from that this purple area which is the area under <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me stick with that greenish color", "entities": []}
{"text": "who knows maybe itll involve some you know a circle involves pi which is this really messy number so maybe all curves have these kind of messy areas", "entities": []}
{"text": "the area under just the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when <equation> what is this expression  well thats easy too", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do it in a loud color", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to evaluate it from <expression> and <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just put <expression> in for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i guess we could figure it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so instead of doing that lets do the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to have to evaluate this thing at <expression> and <expression> and subtract the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "where i had just left off we were trying to figure out this area between these <expression> curves and we figured out that its really the area between the curves between the point <expression> <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we divide by this new exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean you might actually find this easy but lets figure out the area between <expression>  i dont know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know i find is this of exciting because if just my intuition i was like oh i have these <expression> curves and i mean they do intersect at the nice integer number but you know what its probably going to be some really messy number of what the areas between these <expression> curves right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to figure out this area inside the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should have done something with an even exponent so i could have had this cup shape but anyway the absolute value solved my problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i say <equation> i think you see where i realized my mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "this problems a little hairy just because i had a bad choice of initial function", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have committed so much to this cup shape that ill make it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i want to figure out the area inside of the curve where the height here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh and thats half of it right so we want to multiply that by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this <expression> its just <expression> of those neat things about math", "entities": []}
{"text": "im about to run out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually that might be even simpler because when you evaluate it from <expression> to <expression> it simplify things a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "this could have just been rewritten this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we raise it <expression> more power so it becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could have said this", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we do that well <expression> way we could do it is just like we did the last <expression> we can figure out some function thats essentially a line a horizontal line that goes straight across here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think im running out of space", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i was proposing of a way to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the indefinite integral for <expression> to <expression> of the top function the top boundary <expression> minus the bottom boundary", "entities": []}
{"text": "not exactly what i wanted but well work on forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the mistake obviously <expression> is not a parabola looking thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact some people start this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dividing by a fraction is like multiplying by its reciprocal", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i say <expression> is <expression> theres <expression> places where thats true", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats kind of like the combined area", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could just rewrite a new function which is the difference of these <expression> functions and it would have been equivalent", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do something simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "right it was <expression> we added <expression> to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "subtract this expression evaluated at <expression> from this expression evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we multiply that by <expression> we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a bit of a trick problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to subtract from that the area from <expression> to <expression> whats under <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to go up real fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me do <expression> more problem since i have time", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just from <expression> to <expression> the integral of <expression> because <expression> is the green function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> and then <expression> is <expression> and the next is <expression> thats <expression> so the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is this area we know its between <expression> and <expression> so we just set up the indefinite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can multiply if i wanted to but i have <expression> seconds left so ill leave you there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all we just have to figure out what the antiderivative of this inner expression is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could do this <expression> separate problems <expression> separate indefinite integrals or you could do it as <expression> indefinite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets stick with the second one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just based on the last example we did we could just write the indefinite integral and im not going to rewrite the fundamental theorem from calculus because i think you know that by now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well essentially just be figuring out the area between the <expression> functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "x to the fifth goes negative like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we need to figure out what the area is between the <expression> so we need to figure out what are these <expression> points", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just goes straight across", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that this is not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens when <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the antiderivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> and actually you know what i made a mistake", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me draw it actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent figured out what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the <expression> points", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "see those are the same thing as the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this will be a little bit tricky but <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you havent seen <expression> yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when does <equation> i mean you could solve it algebraically you know you could say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the area between the <expression> and <expression> is <expression> which is a pretty clean number", "entities": []}
{"text": "x to the fifth is going to go up super fast something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i wanted to figure out the areas this sides going to go real fast too between that and instead of figuring out the area between xaxis and that <expression> i want to figure out the area between <expression> and instead of figuring out this bottom area right like the normal problems weve done we would figure out this type of area you know between <expression> points", "entities": []}
{"text": "do you think you know how to do it well i think you do", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok im going to draw the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "this isnt kind of a step of the problem but you could have done it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to know the larger area right", "entities": []}
{"text": "magenta", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that  <expression> is just <expression> right so we just use the same antiderivative rules weve always used", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> and then minus i think the second term is pretty easy for you <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just a constant function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets now evaluate this definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "this definite integral is from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now it should be clearer to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can make this a little bit bigger", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to do it however it is least confusing to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "how did i know to substitute <equation> well because i say well the derivative of this function is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its really the same thing as what we just did with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we are done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets take the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me do it with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just i didnt formally do the substitution but its the exact same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when <expression> is <expression> <expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> thats the same thing is <expression> did that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember how did i do this what allowed me to treat this <expression> just like an <expression> or like a <expression> when i did it with the substitution well i had its derivative sitting right here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its exactly the same with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well essentially were just going to do the same thing but were going to do it with substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the way i always think about it is well i have a cosine and a sin", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression> its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that hopefully weve learned already", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we care about were defining the definite integral between <expression> which is roughly here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i find du this whole thing is going to end up being du and let me show that to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean if this cube right here is <expression> then that looks about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its good to be able to do it with substitution helps you from making careless mistakes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is going from <equation> to <expression> what is <expression> going from well when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me do it with substitution just because the way i was just doing is kind of my shortcut back in the day when i was a mathlete", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have cosine of <expression> and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just wanted to show you that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the fun part", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we erase all of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since the a curve is below the xaxis here this area is going to be a negative number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive graphed this function right here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was our original substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is a very important thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what was the chain rule the chain rule said if i took the derivative of <expression> that this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just the same thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully you found that vaguely useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so before we just chug through the math and do the antiderivatives and use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral lets think about what were even doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the antiderivative is <expression> and i evaluate it at <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me since we have a little bit of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so between <expression> which is right there and between <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the cosine is squared so all these crazy things are happening to it so it seems like i could use substitution or the reverse chain rules some out here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me rewrite this first of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "since the derivative is here i can just treat this whole thing like an <expression> term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we look at this area from our original graph what we just solved as we said the area of the curve between here and here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the integral from <equation> to <equation> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the intuition all works out at least", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the cosine of <expression> and then the derivative of <expression> or the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "transcript for definite integral with substitution so ive been sent this definite integral problem and it seemed as good as any and i think the key with this is just to see a lot of examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if we have this integral right here what i do is i say well i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its actually <expression> and we have a minus sin here so that works out well too", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me write that as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is <expression> if we multiply both sides by the differential <expression> get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little bit quicker sometimes", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is pretty straightforward and im just going to rewrite it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this seems like a simple problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i did is i increased this exponent to get the third and i divided by that exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "that might completely confuse you but i just wrote that here because we could say well what if <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could just take the derivative of this you get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you understood this and if you did dont worry about what im going to do now but i want to show you how i tend to do it where i just think of it is the reverse chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway hope you found that helpful", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we get the same answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same thing as the integral from <expression> to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that looks about right that looks about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we look at the original equation this right here we just showed  <expression> and this right here is what <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this confuse you ignore it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok let me erase that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have a function and its being squared and i have its derivative so i can figure out its antiderivative by using substitution or the reverse chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that gives us immediately an intuition", "entities": []}
{"text": "now were going to have to evaluate it at <expression> and subtract from that it evaluated at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is <expression> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make a substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will arbitrarily switch colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what gave me the license to just take the antiderivative pretend like this <expression> is just an <expression> is just a <expression> you could even say and just take its exponent raise it by <expression> and divide it by <expression> and then evaluate it from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "same thing right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now ill rearrange some of the terms here just to make it a little bit easier to read", "entities": []}
{"text": "or we could do the substitution and reverse the substitution and then evaluate the boundaries but lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression> and so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well thats a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if youre going to do substitution if were going to say <equation> were going to have to actually make this substitution on the boundaries", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression> which is fairly straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the definite integral of this function between here and here is essentially the area of the curve between the curve and the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "we should be getting a negative number when we evaluate this and just to prove this i actually typed it in up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if we wanted the absolute area because you cant really have a negative area its <expression> but we know its negative because this curve is below the xaxis here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> so this  <expression> minus this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me a erase this if this confuses people", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so were ready to begin the fifth lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "im glad to be back", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you for entertaining my colleague haynes miller", "entities": []}
{"text": "so today were going to continue where he started namely what he talked about was the chain rule which is probably the most powerful technique for extending the kinds of functions that you can differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to use the chain rule in some rather clever algebraic ways today", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "so the topic for today is whats known as implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so implicit differentiation is a technique that allows you to differentiate a lot of functions you didnt even know how to find before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a technique  lets wait for a few people to sit down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "physics huh", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay more physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take a break", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can get those after class", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so were talking about implicit differentiation and im going to illustrate it by several examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is one of the most important and basic formulas that weve already covered part way", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what weve got so far is the exponents <expression> etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "you did the positive integer powers in the first lecture and then yesterday professor miller told you about the negative powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were going to do right now today is were going to consider the exponents which are rational numbers ratios of integers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> are integers", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats our goal for right now and were going to use this method of implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular its important to realize that this covers the case <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and those are the nth roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when we take the <expression> were going to cover that right now along with many other examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is our first example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we just write down a formula for the function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "the function is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what were trying to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now theres really only two steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first step is to take this equation to the nth power so write it <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "alright so thats just the same equation rewritten", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what were going to do is were going to differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to apply <expression> to the equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "now why is it that we can apply it to the second equation not the first equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should call these equation <expression> and equation <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the point is we can apply it to equation <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason is that we dont know how to differentiate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "thats something we just dont know yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we do know how to differentiate integer powers", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "those are the things that we took care of before", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now were in shape to be able to do the differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to write it out explicitly over here without carrying it out just yet", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you see this expression here requires us to do something we couldnt do before yesterday", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely this <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to apply the chain rule here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "so this is the same as  this is by the chain rule now  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "and then on the right hand side we can just carry it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right now this is our scheme", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll see in a minute why we win with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all there are two factors here", "entities": []}
{"text": "one of them is unknown", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact its what were looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the other one is going to be a known quantity because we know how to differentiate <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "thats the same formula although the letter has been changed", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is the same as  ill write it underneath here  <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay now comes if you like the noncalculus part of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember the noncalculus part of the problem is always the messier part of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to figure out this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "this formula the answer over here which maybe ill put in a box now has this expressed much more simply only in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we have to do now is just solve for <expression> using algebra and then solve all the way in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "so first of all we solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "so i do that by dividing the factor on the lefthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to plug in so ill write this as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now over here im going to put in for <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "so now were almost done but unfortunately we have this mess of exponents that we have to work out", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to write it one more time", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so i already recognize the factor a out front", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "thats not going to be a problem for me and thats what im aiming for here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now i have to encode all of these powers so lets just write it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "its <expression> and then its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats the law of exponents applied to this ratio here", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and then well do the arithmetic over here on the next board", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have here <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i multiply n by this i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if the second factor is minus minus thats a plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "altogether the two ms cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lo and behold thats the same thing as a <expression> just what we wanted", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay again just a bunch of arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "from this point forward from this substitution on its just the arithmetic of exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so weve done our first example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to give you a couple more examples so lets just continue", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next example ill keep relatively simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have example two which is going to be the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats not really a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a way of defining y as a function of x implicitly", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the idea that i could solve for y if i wanted to", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and indeed lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you solve for y here what happens is you get <equation> and <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so this if you like is the implicit definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here is the explicit function <expression> which is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now just for my own convenience im just going to take the positive branch", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just really a circle in disguise", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im just going to take the top part of the circle so well take that top hump here", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so that means im erasing this minus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just taking the positive branch just for my convenience", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could do it just as well with the negative branch", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so now ive taken the solution and i can differentiate with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so rather than using the <expression> notation over here im going to switch notations over here because its less writing", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 75}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "im going to write y and change notations", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "okay so i want to take the derivative of this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "well this is a somewhat complicated function here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> and the right way always to look at functions like this is to rewrite them using the fractional power notation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 86}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 127}]}
{"text": "thats the first step in computing a derivative of a square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the second step here is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "does somebody want to tell me", "entities": []}
{"text": "chain rule right", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have two things", "entities": []}
{"text": "we start with one and then we do something else to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whenever we do two things to something we need to apply the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 58}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 73}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the first factor i claim is the derivative of this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> blah to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im doing this kind of by the advanced method now because weve already graduated", "entities": []}
{"text": "you already did the chain rule last time", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so what does this mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an abbreviation for the derivative with respect to blah of blah <expression> whatever it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats the first factor that were going to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "rather than actually write out a variable for it and pass through as i did previously with this <expression> and <expression> variable here im just going to skip that step and let you imagine it as being a placeholder for that variable here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this variable is now parenthesis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to multiply that by the rate of change of whats inside with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now again we couldnt have done this example two before example one because we needed to know that the power rule worked not just for a integer but also for <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 106, "end_offset": 116}]}
{"text": "were using the case <equation> right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> times and this <expression> here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": " so this is the case <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> happens to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so im putting all those things together", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know within a week you have to be doing this very automatically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to do it at this speed now", "entities": []}
{"text": "you want to do it even faster ultimately", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question is could i have done it implicitly without the square roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what im about to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an illustration of whats called the explicit solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this guy is whats called explicit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to contrast it with the method that were going to now use today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it involves a lot of complications", "entities": []}
{"text": "it involves the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and as well see it can get messier and messier", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres the implicit method which i claim is easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see what happens if you do it implicitly the implicit method involves instead of writing the function in this relatively complicated way with the square root it involves leaving it alone", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont do anything to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this previous case we were left with something which was complicated say <expression> or <expression> or something complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "we had to simplify it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "we had an equation one which was more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "we simplified it then differentiated it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that was a simpler case", "entities": []}
{"text": "well here the simplest thing us to differentiate is the one we started with because squares are practically the easiest thing after first powers or maybe zeroth powers to differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were leaving it alone", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the simplest possible form for it and now were going to differentiate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "so what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again whats the method", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me remind you", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre applying <expression> to the equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "so you have to differentiate the left side of the equation and differentiate the right side of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its this and what you get is <expression>  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the chain rule again", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "i did it a different way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to get you used to many different notations at once", "entities": []}
{"text": "well really just two", "entities": []}
{"text": "just the prime notation and the <expression> notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is what i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now all i have to do is solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "so that <expression> if i put the <expression> on the other side is <expression> and then divide by <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets compare our solutions and ill apologize im going to have to erase something to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets compare our two solutions", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "im going to put this underneath and simplify", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what was our solution over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was what we got over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the same thing if i cancel the 2s and i change it back to looking like a square root thats the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula for the derivative when i do it the explicit way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill just compare them these two expressions here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice they are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the same because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question is why did the implicit method not give the bottom half of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "very good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer to that is that it did", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just didnt mention it", "entities": []}
{"text": "wait ill explain", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose i stuck in a minus sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would have gotten this with the difference so with an extra minus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then when i compared it to what was over there i would have had to have another different minus sign over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually both places would get an extra minus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they would still coincide", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually the implicit method is a little better", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt even notice the difference between the branches", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does the job on both the top and bottom half", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way of saying that is that youre calculating the slopes here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets look at this picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres a slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just take a look at a positive value of <expression> and just check the sign to see whats happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take a positive value of <expression> over here <expression> is positive", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "this denominator is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slope is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see that its tilting down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now on the bottom side its going to be tilting up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly whats happening up here is that both <expression> and <expression> are positive and this <expression> and this <expression> are positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the slope is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand on the bottom side  is still positive but <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its tilting up because the denominator is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the numerator is positive and this minus sign has a positive slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it matches perfectly in every category", "entities": []}
{"text": "this complicated however and its easier just to keep track of one branch at a time even in advanced math", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so we only do it one branch at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now i want to give you a slightly more complicated example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed some of the so heres a little more complicated example", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not going to be the most complicated example but you know itll be a little tricky", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this example im going to give you a fourth order equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it just so happens that theres a trick to solving this equation so actually you can do both the explicit method and the nonexplicit method", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the explicit method would say okay well i want to solve for this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 62}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "so im going to use the quadratic formula but on <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "this is quadratic in <expression> because theres a fourth power and a second power and the first and third powers are missing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is the <expression> and <equation> in the quadratic formula", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "and so the formula for <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now you can see this problem of branches this happens actually in a lot of cases coming up in an elaborate way", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have two choices for the sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have two choices for the sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "conceivably as many as four roots for this equation because its a fourth degree equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its quite a mess", "entities": []}
{"text": "you should have to check each branch separately", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this really is that level of complexity and in general its very difficult to figure out the formulas for quartic equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but fortunately were never going to use them", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is were never going to need those formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the implicit method is far easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "the implicit method just says okay ill leave the equation in its simplest form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now differentiate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so when i differentiate i get <expression> plus  now here i have to apply the product rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 73}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "so i differentiate the <expression> and the <expression> separately", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "first i differentiate with respect to <expression> so i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "then i differentiate with respect to the other factor the <expression> factor", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the <expression> gives me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the implicit differentiation step", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i just want to solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "so im going to factor out <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "thats the factor on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to put the <expression> on the other side", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "<expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the formula for <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the formula for the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have a question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor so the question is for the y would we have to put in what solved for in the explicit equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is absolutely yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not a complete solution to a problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "we started with an implicit equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "we differentiated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we got in the end also an implicit equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt tell us what <expression> is as a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to go back to this formula to get the formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example let me give you an example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this hides a degree of complexity of the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its a degree of complexity that we must live with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example at <equation> you can see that <equation> solves", "entities": []}
{"text": "that happens to be solves <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why i picked the <expression> actually so it would be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just wanted to have a convenient solution there to pull out of my hat at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i did that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we now know that when <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at 1 1 along the curve the slope  what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have to plug in here <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "thats just plugging in that formula over there which turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can get it", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand at say <equation> were stuck using this formula star here to find <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so let me just make two points about this which are just philosophical points for you right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first is when i promised you at the beginning of this class that we were going to be able to differentiate any function you know i meant it very literally", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i meant is if you know the function well be able give a formula for the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont know how to find a function youll have a lot of trouble finding the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we didnt make any promises that if you cant find the function you will be able to find the derivative by some magic", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will never happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "and however complex the function is a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients were stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the big advantage of his method notice is that although weve had to find star we had to find this formula star and there are many other ways of doing these things numerically by the way which well learn later so theres a good method for doing it numerically", "entities": []}
{"text": "although we had to find star we never had to differentiate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we had a fast way of getting the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we had to know what <expression> and <expression> were", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> we got by an algebraic formula in terms of the values here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is very fast forgetting the slope once you know the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student whats in the parentheses", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor sorry this is well lets see if i can manage this", "entities": []}
{"text": "is this the parentheses youre talking about", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah say", "entities": []}
{"text": "that says say", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so maybe i should put commas around it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it was s a y comma comma okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "well here was at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just throwing out a value", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other value", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually there is one value my favorite value", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is easy to evaluate right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> i can do it there", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats maybe the only one", "entities": []}
{"text": "the others are a nuisance", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have to do something more here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this implicit differentiation method has one very very important application to finding inverse functions or finding derivatives of inverse functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets talk about that next", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first maybe well just illustrate by an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have the function <expression> for <expression> positive then of course this idea is that we should simplify this equation and we should square it so we get this somewhat simpler equation here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 115}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 129}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 150}]}
{"text": "and then we have a notation for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we call <equation> and <equation> this is the reversal of this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "then the formula for <expression> is that it should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in general if we start with any old <equation> and we just write down this is the defining relationship for a function <expression> the property that were saying is that <expression> has got to bring us back to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we write that in a couple of different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "we call <expression> the inverse of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also we call <expression> the inverse of <expression> although im going to be silent about which variable i want to use because people mix them up a little bit as well be doing when we draw some pictures of this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets draw pictures of both <expression> and <expression> on the same graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all im going to draw the graph of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "thats some shape like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to understand what <expression> is so lets do the analysis in general but then well draw it in this particular case", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have <equation> thats really just the same equation right", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the equation <equation> thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation> those are the same equations its the same curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but suppose now that we wanted to write down what <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "in other words we wanted to switch the variables so draw them as i said on the same graph with the same <expression> and the same <expression> axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "then that would be in effect trading the roles of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to rename every point on the graph which is the ordered pair x y and trade it for the opposite one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when you exchange <expression> and <expression> so to do this exchange <expression> and <expression> and when you do that graphically what that looks like is the following suppose you have a place here and this is the <expression> and this is the <expression> then you want to trade them", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "so you want the y here right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its sort of the opposite place over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is the place which is directly opposite this point across the diagonal line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you reflect across this or you flip across that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get this other shape that looks like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill draw it with a colored piece of chalk here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this guy here is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed if you look at these graphs this one is the square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one happens to be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you take this one and you turn it you reverse the roles of the x axis and the y axis and tilt it on its side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the picture of what an inverse function is and now i want to show you that the method of implicit differentiation allows us to compute the derivatives of inverse functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just say it in general and then ill carry it out in particular", "entities": []}
{"text": "so implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of any inverse function provided we know the derivative of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that for what is an example which is truly complicated and a little subtle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has a very pretty answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well carry out an example here which is the function <expression> is  the inverse tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again for the inverse tangent all of the things that were going to do are going to be based on simplifying this equation by taking the tangent of both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so us let me remind you by the way the inverse tangent is whats also known as arctangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just another notation for the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what were going to use to describe this function is the equation tan <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what happens when you take the tangent of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is how were going to figure out what the function looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all i want to draw it and then well do the computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make the diagram first", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to do something which is analogous to what i did over here with the square root function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all i remind you that the tangent function is defined between two values here which are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it starts out at minus infinity and curves up like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the one that we have to sketch is this one which we get by reflecting this across the axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "well not the axis the diagonal", "entities": []}
{"text": "this slope by the way should be less  a little lower here so that we can have it going down and up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me show you what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the front its going to look a lot like this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one had curved down and so the reflection across the diagonal curved up", "entities": []}
{"text": "here this is curving up so the reflection is going to curve down", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to look like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should sorry lets use a different color because its reversed from before", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just call it green", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the original curve in the first quadrant eventually had an asymptote which was straight up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one is going to have an asymptote which is horizontal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that level is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the highest", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now similarly the other way were going to do this and this bottom level is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the picture of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "its defined for all <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this green guy is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its defined all the way from minus infinity to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to use a notation that we had from limit notation as x goes to infinity lets say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats an example of one value thats of interest in addition to the finite values", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now the first ingredient that were going to need is were going to need the derivative of the tangent function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to recall for you and maybe you havent worked this out yet but i hope that many of you have that if you take the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 151}]}
{"text": "so this you do by the quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is of the form <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "you use the quotient rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so im going to get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what you get in the end is some marvelous simplification that comes out to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can recognize <expression> from the fact that you should get <expression> in the denominator and somehow the numerators all cancel and simplifies to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is also known as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that something that if you havent done yet youre going to have to do this as an exercise", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need that ingredient and now were just going to differentiate our equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 67}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "and what do we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get again <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if you like <expression> times in the other notation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive just used the formulas that i just wrote down there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now all i have to do is solve for <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "unfortunately this is not the form that we ever want to leave these things in", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the same problem we had with that ugly square root expression or with any of the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to rewrite in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "our original question was what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so far we have the following answer to that question its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is a correct answer but way too complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that doesnt mean that if you took a random collection of functions you wouldnt end up with something this complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "but these particular functions these beautiful circular functions involved with trigonometry all have very nice formulas associated with them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this simplifies tremendously", "entities": []}
{"text": "so one of the skills that you need to develop when youre dealing with trig functions is to simplify this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"text": "and so lets see now that expressions like this all simplify", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres only one formula one ingredient that we need to use to do this and then were going to draw a diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the ingredient again is the original defining relationship that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> can be encoded in a right triangle in the following way heres the right triangle and <expression> means that <expression> should be represented as an angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then its tangent is the ratio of this vertical to this horizontal side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just going to pick two values that work namely <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the simplest ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive encoded this equation in this picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now all i have to do is figure out what the <expression> is in this right triangle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in order to do that i need to figure out what the hypotenuse is but thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can read off what the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is <expression> divided by the hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> over square root whoops yeah <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so our answer over here the preferred answer which is way simpler than what i wrote up there is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill stop here for one more question", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have one more calculation which i can do even in less than a minute", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a whole minute for questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor what happens to the inverse tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "the inverse tangent okay this inverse tangent is the same as this <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i did was i skipped this step here entirely", "entities": []}
{"text": "i never wrote that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the inverse tangent was that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the issue was whats a good formula for <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i am evaluating that but im doing it using the letter <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words what happened to the inverse tangent is that i called it <expression> which is what its been all along", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now im going to do the case of the <expression> the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill show you how easy this is if i dont fuss with because this one has an easy trig identity associated with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <equation> and <equation> and now watch how simple it is when i do the differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just differentiate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "i get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> so that implies that  <expression> and now to rewrite that in terms of <expression> i have to just recognize that this is the same as this which is the same as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "so all told the derivative with respect to <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these implicit differentiations are very convenient", "entities": []}
{"text": "however i warn you that you do have to be careful about the range of applicability of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to draw a picture like this one to make sure you know where this makes sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words you have to pick a branch for the sine function to work that out and theres something like that on your problem set", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its also discussed in your text", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well stop here", "entities": []}
{"text": " voiceover lets now introduce ourselves to the idea of a differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as well see differential equations are super useful for modeling and simulating phenomena and understanding how they operate", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well get into that later", "entities": []}
{"text": "for now lets just think about or at least look at what a differential equation actually is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to write so lets see here is an example of differential equation if i were to write that the second derivative of <expression> times the first derivative of <equation> this right over here is a differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way we could write it if we said that <expression> is a function of <expression> we could write this in function notation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 98, "end_offset": 129}]}
{"text": "we could write the second derivative of our function with respect to <expression> times the first derivative of our function  <expression> times our function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "or if we wanted to use the leibniz notation we could also write the second derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> times the first derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all three of these equations are really representing the same thing theyre saying ok can i find functions where the second derivative of the function plus <expression> times the first derivative of the function  <expression> times the function itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just to be clear these are all essentially saying the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you might have just caught from how i described it that the solution to a differential equation is a function or a class of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not just a value or a set of values", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the solution here so the solution to a differential equation is a function or a set of functions or a class of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "its important to contrast this relative to a traditional equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write that down", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so a traditional equation maybe i shouldnt say traditional equation differential equations have been around for a while", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write this as maybe an algebraic equation that youre familiar with", "entities": []}
{"text": "an algebraic equation might look something like and ill just write up a simple quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solutions to this algebraic equation are going to be numbers or a set of numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can solve this its going to be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> could be  <expression> or <expression> could be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solutions here are numbers or a set of values that satisfy the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "here its a relationship between a function and its derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the solutions or the solution is going to be a function or a set of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets make that a little more tangible", "entities": []}
{"text": "what would a solution to something like any of these three which really represent the same thing what would a solution actually look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me move this over a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "move this over a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can take a look at what some of these solutions could look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me erase this a little", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "this little stuff that i have right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just gonna give you examples of solutions here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well verify that these indeed are solutions for i guess this is really just one differential equation represented in different ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "but youll hopefully appreciate what a solution to a differential equation looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that there is often more than one solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a whole class of functions that could be a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so one solution to this differential equation and ill just write it as our first one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so one solution ill call it y one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i could even write it as <expression> to make it explicit that it is a function of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "one solutions is <equation> to the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i encourage you to pause this video right now and find the first derivative of <expression> and the second derivative of <expression> and verify that it does indeed satisfy this differential equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "so im assuming youve had a go at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets work through this together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first derivative of <expression> so we just have to do the chain rule here the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "and the derivative of <expression> to the <expression> with respect to <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we take the second derivative of <expression> this  the same exact idea the derivative of this is <expression> is going to be <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "and now we could just substitute these values into the differential equation or these expressions into the differential equation to verify that this is indeed going to be true for this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets verify that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we first have the second derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats that term right over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression> times the first derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats going to be <expression> times this right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be <expression> ill just write <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "notice i just took this two times the first derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> times the first derivative is going to be  or needs to be  if this indeed does satisfy if <expression> does indeed satisfy the differential equation this needs to be  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if that indeed is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these <expression> terms right over here <expression> essentially <expression> thats gonna be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is indeed  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is indeed a solution to this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as well see it is not the only solution to this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example lets say <equation> is also a solution to this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i encourage you to pause the video again and verify that its a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so assuming youve had a go at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first derivative of this is pretty straightforward is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "second derivative one of the profound things of the exponential function the second derivative here is also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the second derivative let me just do it in those same colors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the second derivative is going to be <expression> is indeed going to be  to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is absolutely going to be true", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is also a solution to this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a start", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the next few videos well explore this more", "entities": []}
{"text": "well start to see what the solutions look like what classes of solutions are techniques for solving them visualizing solutions to differential equations and a whole toolkit for kind of digging in deeper", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so again welcome to 18", "entities": []}
{"text": "01", "entities": []}
{"text": "were getting started today with what were calling unit one a highly imaginative title", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me first tell you briefly whats in store in the next couple of weeks", "entities": []}
{"text": "the main topic today is what is a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to look at this from several different points of view and the first one is the geometric interpretation", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what well spend most of today on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well also talk about a physical interpretation of what a derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres going to be something else which i guess is maybe the reason why calculus is so fundamental and why we always start with it in most science and engineering schools which is the importance of derivatives of this to all measurements", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means pretty much every place", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means in science in engineering in economics in political science etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "polling lots of commercial applications just about everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats what well be getting started with and then theres another thing that were gonna do in this unit which is were going to explain how to differentiate anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how to differentiate any function you know", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats kind of a tall order but let me just give you an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want to take the derivative  this well see today is the notation for the derivative of something  of some messy function like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well work this out by the end of this unit", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "anything you can think of anything you can write down we can differentiate it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "all right so thats what were gonna do and today as i said were gonna spend most of our time on this geometric interpretation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets begin with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go with the geometric interpretation of derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what were going to do is just ask the geometric problem of finding the tangent line to some graph of some function at some point", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is to say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the problem that were addressing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so heres our problem and now let me show you the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well lets graph the function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "heres its graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres some point", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right maybe i should draw it just a bit lower", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its above the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> by the way this was supposed to be an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was some fixed place on the xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to perform this mighty feat i will use another color of chalk", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about red", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the tangent line well not quite straight", "entities": []}
{"text": "close enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the geometric problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i achieved what i wanted to do and its kind of an interesting question which unfortunately i cant solve for you in this class which is how did i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is how physically did i manage to know what to do to draw this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats what geometric problems are like", "entities": []}
{"text": "we visualize it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can figure it out somewhere in our brains", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the task that we have now is to figure out how to do it analytically to do it in a way that a machine could just as well as i did in drawing this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did we learn in high school about what a tangent line is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well a tangent line has an equation and any line through a point has the equation <equation> the slope times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the equation for that line and now there are two pieces of information that were going to need to work out what the line is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first one is the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats that point <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to specify <expression> given <expression> we need to know the level of <expression> which is of course just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not a calculus problem but anyway thats a very important part of the process", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the first thing we need to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the second thing we need to know is the slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats this number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in calculus we have another name for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the calculus part", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the tricky part and thats the part that we have to discuss now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just to make that explicit here im going to make a definition which is that <expression>  which is known as the derivative of <expression> at <expression> is the slope of the tangent line to <equation> at the point lets just call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what it is but still i havent made any progress in figuring out any better how i drew that line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to say something thats more concrete because i want to be able to cook up what these numbers are", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to figure out what this number <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one way of thinking about that let me just try this so i certainly am taking for granted that in sort of noncalculus part that i know what a line through a point is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i know this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but another possibility might be this line here how do i know  well unfortunately i didnt draw it quite straight but there it is  how do i know that this orange line is not a tangent line but this other line is a tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its actually not so obvious but im gonna describe it a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not really the fact this thing crosses at some other place which is this point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its not really the fact that the thing crosses at two place because the line could be wiggly the curve could be wiggly and it could cross back and forth a number of times", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not what distinguishes the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna have to somehow grasp this and ill first do it in language", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the following idea its that if you take this orange line which is called a secant line and you think of the point <expression> as getting closer and closer to <expression> then the slope of that line will get closer and closer to the slope of the red line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we draw it close enough then thats gonna be the correct line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats really what i did sort of in my brain when i drew that first line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats the way im going to articulate it first", "entities": []}
{"text": "now so the tangent line is  the limit of so called secant lines <expression> as <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here were thinking of p as being fixed and <expression> as variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is still the geometric discussion but now were gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well be able to work out formulas in any example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all im gonna write out these points <expression> and <expression> again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so maybe well put <expression> here and <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im thinking of this line through them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess it was orange so well leave it as orange", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to compute its slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this gradually well do this in two steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus including multivariable calculus across the board", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first notation thats used is you imagine heres the xaxis underneath and heres the <expression> the location directly below the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were traveling here a horizontal distance which is denoted by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> so called", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we could also call it the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats one thing we want to measure in order to get the slope of this line <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other thing is this height", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this distance here which we denote <expression> which is the change in <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "and then the slope is just the ratio <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the slope of the secant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the process i just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself but also in particular to its slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we write that is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and thats going to be our slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the slope of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is still a little general and i want to work out a more usable form here a better formula for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to do that im gonna write <expression> the numerator more explicitly here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "the change in f so remember that the point <expression> is the point <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right thats what we got for the formula for the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to compute these distances and in particular the vertical distance here im gonna have to get a formula for <expression> as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this horizontal distance is <expression> then this location is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the point above that point has a formula which is <expression> <expression> of  and this is a mouthful  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so theres the formula for the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the formula for the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can write a different formula for the derivative which is the following so this <expression>  which is the same as <expression> is going to be the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of the change in <expression> well the change in <expression> is the value of <expression> at the upper point here which is <expression> and minus its value at the lower point <expression> which is <expression> divided by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so this is the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to put this in a little box because this is by far the most important formula today which we use to derive pretty much everything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the way that were going to be able to compute these numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "this example well call this example one", "entities": []}
{"text": "well take the function <expression>  which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "thats sufficiently complicated to have an interesting answer and sufficiently straightforward that we can compute the derivative fairly quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it that were gonna do here", "entities": []}
{"text": "all were going to do is were going to plug in this formula here for that function", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats all were going to do and visually what were accomplishing is somehow to take the hyperbola and take a point on the hyperbola and figure out some tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what were accomplishing when we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were accomplishing this geometrically but well be doing it algebraically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first we consider this difference <expression> and write out its formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to have a place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna make it again above this point <expression> which is the general point", "entities": []}
{"text": "well make the general calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the value of <expression> at the top when we move to the right by <expression> so i just read off from this read off from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the formula the first thing i get here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the left hand term", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats the right hand term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to divide that by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so heres our expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and by the way this has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "this thing is called a difference quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "its pretty complicated because theres always a difference in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in disguise the denominator is a difference because its the difference between the value on the right side and the value on the left side here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now were going to simplify it by some algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this  lets continue on the next level here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "all im going to do is put it over a common denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the common denominator is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in the numerator for the first expressions i have <expression> and for the second expression i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same thing as i had in the numerator before factoring out this denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here i put that numerator into this more amenable form", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now there are two basic cancellations", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first one is that <expression> and <expression> cancel so we have this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the second step is that these two expressions cancel the numerator and the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have a cancellation that we can make use of", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well write that under here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the very last step is to take the limit as <expression> tends to <expression> and now we can do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "before we couldnt do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "why", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the numerator and the denominator gave us <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now that ive made this cancellation i can pass to the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all that happens is i set this <expression> and i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so thats the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so in other words what ive shown  let me put it up here  is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets look at the graph just a little bit to check this for plausibility all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats happening here is first of all its negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "its less than <expression> which is a good thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "you see that slope there is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the simplest check that you could make", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the second thing that i would just like to point out is that as <expression> goes to infinity that as we go farther to the right it gets less and less steep", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as <expression> goes to infinity less and less steep", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats also consistent here when <expression> is very large this is a smaller and smaller number in magnitude although its always negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "its always sloping down", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so ive managed to fill the boards", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should stop for a question or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor so the question is to explain again this limiting process", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the formula here is we have basically <expression> numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words why is it that this expression when <expression> tends to <expression>  <expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me illustrate it by sticking in a number for <expression> to make it more explicit", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so for instance let me stick in here for <expression> the number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the situation that weve got", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the question is what happens as this number gets smaller and smaller and smaller and gets to be practically <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well literally what we can do is just plug in <expression> there and you get <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "<expression> in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what im saying in general with this extra number here", "entities": []}
{"text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor so the question is what happened between this step and this step right", "entities": []}
{"text": "explain this step here", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright so there were two parts to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first is this <expression> which is sitting in the denominator i factored all the way out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so whats in the parentheses is supposed to be the same as whats in the numerator of this other expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then at the same time as doing that i put that expression which is the difference of two fractions i expressed it with a common denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the denominator here you see the product of the denominators of the two fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i just figured out what the numerator had to be without really", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that on the whole calculus gets a bad rap that its actually easier than most things", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a perception that its harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i really have a duty to give you the calculus made harder story here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to make things harder because thats our job", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is actually what most people do in calculus and its the reason why calculus has a bad reputation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the secret is that when people ask problems in calculus they generally ask them in context", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are many many other things going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the little piece of the problem which is calculus is actually fairly routine and has to be isolated and gotten through", "entities": []}
{"text": "but all the rest of it relies on everything else you learned in mathematics up to this stage from grade school through high school", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the complication", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now were going to do a little bit of calculus made hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "by talking about a word problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "we only have one sort of word problem that we can pose because all weve talked about is this geometry point of view", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far those are the only kinds of word problems we can pose", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were gonna do is just pose such a problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so find the areas of triangles enclosed by the axes and the tangent to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats a geometry problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me draw a picture of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its practically the same as the picture for example one", "entities": []}
{"text": "we only consider the first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres our shape", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right its the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres maybe one of our tangent lines which is coming in like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then were trying to find this area here", "entities": []}
{"text": "right so theres our problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why does it have to do with calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has to do with calculus because theres a tangent line in it so were gonna need to do some calculus to answer this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "but as youll see the calculus is the easy part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets get started with this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all im gonna label a few things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one important thing to remember of course is that the curve is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats perfectly reasonable to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and also were gonna calculate the areas of the triangles and you could ask yourself in terms of what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well were gonna have to pick a point and give it a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since we need a number were gonna have to do more than geometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna have to do some of this analysis just as weve done before", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna pick a point and consistent with the labeling weve done before im gonna to call it <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats almost half the battle having notations <expression> and <expression> for the variables and <expression> and <expression> for the specific point", "entities": []}
{"text": "now once you see that you have these labelings i hope its reasonable to do the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all this is the point <expression> and over here is the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats something that were used to in graphs", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to figure out the area of this triangle its pretty clear that we should find the base which is that we should find this location here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we should find the height so we need to find that value there", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets go ahead and do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how are we going to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so lets just take a look", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it that we need to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim that theres only one calculus step and im gonna put a star here for this tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to understand what the tangent line is", "entities": []}
{"text": "once ive figured out what the tangent line is the rest of the problem is no longer calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just that slope that we need", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the formula for the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "put that over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression>  and heres the magic number we already calculated it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its in the box over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the only bit of calculus in this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now were not done", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to finish it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to figure out all the rest of these quantities so we can figure out the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well to find this point this has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "were gonna find the so called <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "thats the first thing were going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to do that what we need to do is to find where this horizontal line meets that diagonal line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the equation for the <expression> is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we plug in <equation> thats this horizontal line and we find this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that into star", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <expression> minus oh one other thing we need to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that <expression> is <expression>  and <expression> is <expression>  so this thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres <expression> and heres <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so in order to find this x value i have to plug in one equation into the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this simplifies a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is plus <expression> because the <expression> and <expression> cancel somewhat", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and so if i put this on the other side i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i then multiply through  so thats what this implies  and if i multiply through by <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "ok so i claim that this point weve just calculated its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im almost done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to get the other one", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to get this one up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im gonna use a very big shortcut to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the shortcut to the yintercept is to use symmetry", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right i claim i can stare at this and i can look at that and i know the formula for the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what that one is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason i know this is the following so heres the symmetry of the situation which is not completely direct", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a kind of mirror symmetry around the diagonal", "entities": []}
{"text": "it involves the exchange of <expression> <expression> with <expression> <expression> so trading the roles of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the symmetry that im using is that any formula i get that involves <expression> and <expression> if i trade all the <expression> and replace them by <expression> and trade all the <expression> and replace them by <expression> then ill have a correct formula on the other way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 110}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 143}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 169, "end_offset": 174}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 200, "end_offset": 207}]}
{"text": "so if everywhere i see a <expression> i make it an <expression> and everywhere i see an <expression> i make it a <expression> the switch will take place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just an accident of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because so the symmetry explained", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that the equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the same thing as <equation> if i multiply through by <expression> which is the same thing as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres where the <expression> and the <expression> get reversed", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now if you dont trust this explanation you can also get the yintercept by plugging <equation> into the equation star", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "we plugged <equation> in and we got the <expression>value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can do the same thing analogously the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so im almost done with the geometry problem and lets finish it off now", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me hold off for one second before i finish it off", "entities": []}
{"text": "what id like to say is just make one more tiny remark", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the hardest part of calculus in my opinion", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the hardest part of calculus is that we call it one variable calculus but were perfectly happy to deal with <expression> variables at a time or <expression> or any number", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this problem i had an <expression> a <expression> an <expression> and a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats already <expression> different things that have various relationships between them", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course the manipulations we do with them are algebraic and when were doing the derivatives we just consider whats known as one variable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really there are millions of variable floating around potentially", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what makes things complicated and thats something that you have to get used to", "entities": []}
{"text": "now theres something else which is more subtle and that i think many people who teach the subject or use the subject arent aware because theyve already entered into the language and theyre so comfortable with it that they dont even notice this confusion", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres something deliberately sloppy about the way we deal with these variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason is very simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are already <expression> variables here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont wanna create six names for variables or eight names for variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really in this problem there were about eight", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just slipped them by you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well notice that the first time that i got a formula for <expression> here it was this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the formula for <expression> which i plugged in right here was from the equation of the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the second time i did it i did not use <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used this equation here so this is not <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the wrong thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an easy mistake to make if the formulas are all a blur to you and youre not paying attention to where they are on the diagram", "entities": []}
{"text": "you see that xintercept calculation there involved where this horizontal line met this diagonal line and <equation> represented this line here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the sloppiness is that <expression> means two different things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we do this constantly because its way way more complicated not to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its much more convenient for us to allow ourselves the flexibility to change the role that this letter plays in the middle of a computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly later on if i had done this by this more straightforward method for the yintercept i would have set <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would have been this vertical line which is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i didnt change the letter <expression> when i did that because that would be a waste for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is one of the main confusions that happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you can keep yourself straight youre a lot better off and as i say this is one of the complexities", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so now lets finish off the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me finally get this area here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually ill just finish it off right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area of the triangle is well its the base times the height", "entities": []}
{"text": "the base is <expression> the height is <expression> and a half of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>  which is <expression> which is lo and behold <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the amusing thing in this case is that it actually didnt matter what <expression> and <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get the same answer every time", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just an accident of the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens to be the function with that property", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so we have some more business today some serious business", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me continue", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all i want to give you a few more notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are just other notations that people use to refer to derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the first one is the following we already wrote <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so when we write <expression> that means the same thing as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "thats a typical notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and previously we wrote <expression> for the derivative so this is newtons notation for the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there are other notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one of them is <expression> and another one is <expression> meaning exactly the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and sometimes we let the function slip down below so that becomes <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are all notations that are used for the derivative and these were initiated by leibniz", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these notations are used interchangeably sometimes practically together", "entities": []}
{"text": "they both turn out to be extremely useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one omits  notice that this thing omits  the underlying base point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one of the nuisances", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt give you all the information", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there are lots of situations like that where people leave out some of the important information and you have to fill it in from context", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats another couple of notations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i have one more calculation for you today", "entities": []}
{"text": "i carried out this calculation of the derivative of the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanna take care of some other powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so example <expression> is going to be the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> one of these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what were trying to figure out is the derivative with respect to <equation> in our new notation what this ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again were going to form this expression <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to make some algebraic simplification", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we plug in for <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "now before let me just stick this in then im gonna erase it", "entities": []}
{"text": "before i wrote <expression> here and <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now im going to get rid of it because in this particular calculation its a nuisance", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have an <expression> floating around which means something different from the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i just dont wanna have to keep on writing all those symbols", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a waste of blackboard energy", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a total amount of energy and ive already filled up so many blackboards that theres just a limited amount", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus im trying to conserve chalk", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway no <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so think of <expression> as fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case <expression> moves and <expression> is fixed in this calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right now in order to simplify this in order to understand algebraically whats going on i need to understand what the nth power of a sum is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats a famous formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "we only need a little tiny bit of it called the binomial theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the binomial theorem which is in your text and explained in an appendix says that if you take the sum of two guys and you take them to the nth power that of course is <expression> multiplied by itself <expression> times", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the first term is <expression> thats when all of the <expression> factors come in", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you could have this factor of <expression> and all the rest <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at least <expression> term of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and how many times does that happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it happens when theres a factor from here from the next factor and so on and so on and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a total of n possible times that that happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the great thing is that with this alone all the rest of the terms are junk that we wont have to worry about", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to be more specific theres a very careful notation for the junk", "entities": []}
{"text": "the junk is whats called <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what that means is that these are terms of order so with <expression> <expression> or higher", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right thats how", "entities": []}
{"text": "very exciting higher order terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this is the only algebra that we need to do and now we just need to combine it together to get our result", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to just carry out the cancellations that we need", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> which remember was <expression> times this which is this times now this is <expression> this junk term minus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what we have so far based on our previous calculations", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to do the main cancellation which is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> plus this term here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and now i can divide in by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so i get <expression> plus now its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "theres at least one factor of <expression> not two factors of <expression> because i have to cancel one of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i can just take the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the limit this term is gonna be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why i called it junk originally because it disappears", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in math junk is something that goes away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this tends to as <expression> goes to <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what ive shown you is that <expression> to the <expression> sorry <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now this is gonna be super important to you right on your problem set in every possible way and i want to tell you one thing one way in which its very important", "entities": []}
{"text": "one way that extends it immediately", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this thing extends to polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get quite a lot out of this one calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if i take <expression> of something like <expression> thats gonna be  <expression> thats applying this rule to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then here ill get <expression> so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the type of thing that we get out of it and were gonna make more hay with that next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i turned myself off", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question was the binomial theorem only works when <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no the binomial theorem is a general formula which also specifies exactly what the junk is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its very much more detailed", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we only needed this part", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt care what all these crazy terms were", "entities": []}
{"text": "its junk for our purposes now because we dont happen to need any more than those first two terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes because <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok see you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far we have learned about partial derivatives and how to use them to find minima and maxima of functions of two variables or several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we are going to try to study in more detail how functions of several variables behave how to compete their variations", "entities": []}
{"text": "how to estimate the variation in arbitrary directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so for that we are going to need some more tools actually to study this things", "entities": []}
{"text": "more tools to study functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "todays topic is going to be differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just to motivate that let me remind you about one trick that you probably know from single variable calculus namely implicit differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that you have a function <equation> then you would sometimes write <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "and then maybe you would  we use implicit differentiation to actually relate infinitesimal changes in y with infinitesimal changes in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one thing we can do with that for example is actually figure out the rate of change <expression> by  but also the reciprocal <expression> by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so for example lets say that we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then we can write <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and from there we can actually find out what is the derivative of this function if we didnt know the answer already by writing <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that tells us that <expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now <expression> for relation to <expression> is basically <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is how you find the formula for the derivative of the inverse sine function", "entities": []}
{"text": "a formula that you probably already knew but that is one way to derive it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we are going to use also these kinds of notations <expression> <expression> and so on but use them for functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course we will have to learn what the rules of manipulation are and what we can do with them", "entities": []}
{"text": "the actual name of that is the total differential as opposed to the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "the total differential includes all of the various causes that can change  sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the contributions that can cause the value of your function <expression> to change", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely lets say that you have a function maybe of three variables <expression> <expression> <expression> then you would write <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"text": "maybe just to remind you of the other notation partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is this object", "entities": []}
{"text": "what are the things on either side of this equality", "entities": []}
{"text": "well they are called differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they are not numbers they are not vectors they are not matrices they are a different kind of object", "entities": []}
{"text": "these things have their own rules of manipulations and we have to learn what we can do with them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we think about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all how do we not think about them", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is an important thing to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "important", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is not the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is meant to be a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is going to be a number once you have a small variation of <expression> a small variation of <expression> a small variation of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> and <expression> are actual numbers and this becomes a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "this guy actually is not a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cannot give it a particular value", "entities": []}
{"text": "all you can do with a differential is express it in terms of other differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact this <expression> <expression> and <expression> well they are mostly symbols out there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you want to think about them they are the differentials of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact you can think of these differentials as placeholders where you will put other things", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course they represent you know there is this idea of changes in <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "one way that one could explain it and i dont really like it is to say they represent infinitesimal changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "another way to say it and i think that is probably closer to the truth is that these things are somehow placeholders to put values and get a tangent approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example if i do replace these symbols by <expression> <expression> and <expression> numbers then i will actually get a numerical quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that will be an approximation formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it will be the linear approximation a tangent plane approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we can do  well let me start first with maybe something even before that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first thing that it does is it can encode how changes in <expression> <expression> <expression> affect the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i would say that is the most general answer to what is this formula what are these differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is a relation between <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a placeholder for small variations <expression> <expression> and <expression> to get an approximation formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression> is approximately  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is getting cramped but i am sure you know what is going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and observe how this one is actually  while that one is approximately ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they are really not the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "another thing that the notation suggests we can do and they claim we can do is divide everything by some variable that everybody depends on", "entities": []}
{"text": "say for example that <expression> <expression> and <expression> actually depend on some parameter <expression> then they will vary at a certain rate <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what the differential will tell us then is the rate of change of <expression> as a function of <expression> when you plug in these values of <expression> <expression> <expression> you will get <expression> by dividing everything by <expression> in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first thing we can do is divide by something like dt to get infinitesimal rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me just say rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that corresponds to the situation where <expression> is a function of <expression> <expression> is a function of <expression> and <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means you can plug in these values into <expression> to get well the value of <expression> will depend on <expression> and then you can find the rate of change with <expression> of a value of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 145}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 150, "end_offset": 164}]}
{"text": "these are the basic rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is known as the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "it is one instance of a chain rule which tells you when you have a function that depends on something and that something in turn depends on something else how to find the rate of change of a function on the new variable in terms of the derivatives of a function and also the dependence between the various variables", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "any questions so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "a word of warming in particular about what i said up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is kind of unfortunate but the textbook actually has a serious mistake on that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean they do have a couple of formulas where they mix a d with a delta and i warn you not to do that please", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean there are ds and there are deltas and basically they dont live in the same world", "entities": []}
{"text": "they dont see each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "the textbook is lying to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first and the second claims i dont really need to justify because the first one is just stating some general principle but i am not making a precise mathematical claim", "entities": []}
{"text": "the second one well we know the approximation formula already so i dont need to justify it for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but on the other hand this formula here i mean you probably have a right to expect some reason for why this works", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is this valid", "entities": []}
{"text": "after all i first told you we have these new mysterious objects", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i am telling you we can do that but i kind of pulled it out of my hat", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean i dont have a hat", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is this valid", "entities": []}
{"text": "how can i get to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is a first attempt of justifying how to get there", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we said <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we know if <expression> is a function of <expression> then <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we plug these into that formula we will get that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i have a relation between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see i got <expression>  sometimes times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> should be that coefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i divide by <expression> then i get the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "that kind of works but that shouldnt be completely satisfactory", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that you are a true skeptic and you dont believe in differentials yet then it is maybe not very good that i actually used more of these differential notations in deriving the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is actually not how it is proved", "entities": []}
{"text": "the way in which you prove the chain rule is not this way because we shouldnt have too much trust in differentials just yet", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "i mean at the end of todays lecture yes probably we should believe in them but so far we should be a little bit reluctant to believe these kind of strange objects telling us weird things", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is a better way to think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "one thing that we have trust in so far are approximation formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "we should have trust in them", "entities": []}
{"text": "we should believe that if we change <expression> a little bit if we change <expression> a little bit then we are actually going to get a change in <expression> that is approximately given by these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is true for any changes in <expression> <expression> <expression> but in particular lets look at the changes that we get if we just take these formulas as function of time and change time a little bit by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will actually use the changes in <expression> <expression> <expression> in a small time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets divide everybody by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "here i am just dividing numbers so i am not actually playing any tricks on you", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean we dont really know what it means to divide differentials but dividing numbers is something we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i take <expression> very small this guy tends to the derivative <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "remember the definition of <expression> is the limit of this ratio when the time interval <expression> tends to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means if i choose smaller and smaller values of <expression> then these ratios of numbers will actually tend to some value and that value is the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly here <expression> when <expression> is really small will tend to the derivative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly for the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means in particular we take the limit as <expression> tends to <expression> and we get <expression> on one side and on the other side we get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "and the approximation becomes better and better", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember when we write approximately  that means it is not quite the same but if we take smaller variations then actually we will end up with values that are closer and closer", "entities": []}
{"text": "when we take the limit as <expression> eventually we get an equality", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean mathematicians have more complicated words to justify this statement", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will spare them for now and you will see them when you take analysis if you go in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets check this with an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that we really dont have any faith in these things so lets try to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i give you a function that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that maybe <expression> will be <expression> <expression> will be <expression> and <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does the chain rule say", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "well the chain rule tells us that <expression> is we start with <expression> well what is that", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "that is <expression> and maybe i should point out that this is <expression>  well <expression> which is going to be just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now lets plug in the actual values of these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression> so that will be <expression> is <expression> is <expression> is <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the end of calculation we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is what the chain rule tells us", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "how else could we find that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we could just plug in values of <expression> <expression> and <expression> <expression> plus <expression> is a function of <expression> and take its derivative", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "lets do that just for verification", "entities": []}
{"text": "it should be exactly the same answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact in this case the two calculations are roughly  in complication", "entities": []}
{"text": "but say that your function of <expression> <expression> <expression> was much more complicated than that or maybe you actually didnt know a formula for it you only knew its partial derivatives then you would need to use the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 216, "end_offset": 219}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 224, "end_offset": 234}]}
{"text": "so sometimes plugging in values is easier but not always", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just check quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other method would be to substitute", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> as a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> was <expression> so you get <expression> <expression> is <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we know how to take the derivative using single variable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we should know", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we dont know then we should take a look at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "the product rule that will be derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and that is the same answer as over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i ended up writing you know maybe i wrote slightly more here but actually the amount of calculations really was pretty much the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "what kind of object is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can think of <expression> as just another variable that is given as a function of <expression> <expression> and <expression> for example", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would have a function of <expression> <expression> <expression> defined by this formula and i call it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i call its value <expression> so that i can substitute <expression> instead of <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "well lets think of <expression> as a function of three variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when i plug in the dependents of these three variables on <expression> then it becomes just a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean really my <expression> here is pretty much what i called <expression> before", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is no major difference between the two", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is an application of what we have seen", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that you want to understand actually all these rules about taking derivatives in single variable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i showed you at the beginning and then erased basically justifies how to take the derivative of a reciprocal function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for that you didnt need multivariable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try to justify the product rule for example for the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "an application of this actually is to justify the product and quotient rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets think for example of a function of two variables <expression> and <expression> that is just the product <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say that <expression> and <expression> are actually functions of one variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then well <expression> is given by the chain rule applied to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now what is the partial of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and partial of <expression> with respect to <expression> is going to be just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get back the usual product rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "that is a slightly complicated way of deriving it but that is a valid way of understanding how to take the derivative of a product by thinking of the product first as a function of variables which are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then say oh but <expression> and <expression> were actually functions of a variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you do the differentiation in two stages using the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly you can do the quotient rule just for practice", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i give you the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right now i am thinking of it as a function of two variables <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> themselves are actually going to be functions of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then well <expression> is going to be partial <expression> partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how much is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "how much is partial <expression> partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>  well next we need to have partial <expression> over partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is the derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we need to know how to differentiate the inverse", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is actually the usual quotient rule just written in a slightly different way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean just in case you really want to see it if you clear denominators for <expression> then you will see basically <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets go to something even more crazy", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim we can do chain rules with more variables", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "lets say that i have a quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets call it <expression> for now", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i have quantity <expression> as a function of say variables <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in the previous setup <expression> and <expression> depended on some parameters <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but actually lets now look at the case where <expression> and <expression> themselves are functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say of two more variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets call them <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am going to stay with these abstract letters but if it bothers you if it sounds completely unmotivated think about it maybe in terms of something you might now", "entities": []}
{"text": "say polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say that i have a function but is defined in terms of the polar coordinate variables on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i know i want to switch to usual coordinates <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "or the other way around i have a function of <expression> and <expression> and i want to express it in terms of the polar coordinates <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i would want to know maybe how the derivatives with respect to the various sets of variables related to each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "one way i could do it is of course to say now if i plug the formula for <expression> and the formula for <expression> into the formula for <expression> then <expression> becomes a function of <expression> and <expression> and it can try to take partial derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "if i have explicit formulas well that could work", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe the formulas are complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "typically if i switch between rectangular and polar coordinates there might be inverse trig there might be maybe arctangent to express the polar angle in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i dont really want to actually substitute arctangents everywhere maybe i would rather deal with the derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is what are partial <expression> over partial <expression> and partial <expression> over partial <expression> in terms of lets see what do we need to know to understand that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well probably we should know how <expression> depends on <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we dont know that then we are probably toast", "entities": []}
{"text": "partial <expression> over partial <expression> partial  over partial <expression> should be required", "entities": []}
{"text": "what else should we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it would probably help to know how <expression> and <expression> depend on <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we dont know that then we dont really know how to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need also <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a lot of partials in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see how we can do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets start by writing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that <expression> is partial <expression> well i dont know why i have two names <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean <expression> and <expression> are really the same thing here but lets say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so far that is our new friend the differential", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what do we want to do with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we would like to get rid of <expression> and <expression> because we like to express things in terms of you know the question we are asking ourselves is lets say that i change <expression> a little bit how does <expression> change", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course what happens if i change <expression> a little bit is <expression> and <expression> will change", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 99, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "how do they change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that is given to me by the differential", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is going to be well i can use the differential again", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is again taking the differential of a function of two variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have the other guy <expression> what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well similarly <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we have a relation between <expression> and <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we are expressing how <expression> reacts to changes in <expression> and <expression> which was our goal", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets actually collect terms so that we see it a bit better", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we have <expression>  something <expression> plus something <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the coefficient here has to be partial <expression> over partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what else could it be", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> if i forget what happens when i change <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the definition of a partial", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly this one has to be partial <expression> over partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is because it is the rate of change with respect to  if i keep <expression> constant so that these guys are completely ignored", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you see how the total differential accounts for somehow all the partial derivatives that come as coefficients of the individual variables in these expressions", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me maybe rewrite these formulas in a more visible way and then reexplain them to you", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is the chain rule for this situation with two intermediate variables and two variables that you express these in terms of", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "in our setting we get partial <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the other one the same thing with <expression> instead of <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to explain various things about these formulas because they look complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually they are not that complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "a couple of things to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first thing how do we remember a formula like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to know how <expression> depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what does <expression> depend on", "entities": []}
{"text": "it depends on <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we will put partial <expression> over partial <expression> and partial <expression> over partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now <expression> and <expression> why are they here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well they are here because they actually depend on <expression> as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "how does <expression> depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how does <expression> depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see the structure of this formula is simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "to find the partial of f with respect to some new variable you use the partials with respect to the variables that <expression> was initially defined in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you multiply them by the partials of <expression> and <expression> in terms of the new variable that you want to look at <expression> here and you sum these things together", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the structure of the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "why does it work", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me explain it to you in a slightly different language", "entities": []}
{"text": "this asks us how does <expression> change if i change <expression> a little bit", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "well why would <expression> change if <expression> changes a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it would change because <expression> actually depends on <expression> and <expression> and <expression> and <expression> depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i change <expression> how quickly does <expression> change", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "well the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i change <expression> at this rate how does that have to change", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "well the answer is <expression> times this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "well at the same time <expression> is also changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "how fast is <expression> changing if i change <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "well at the rate of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now if i change this how does <expression> change", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "well the rate of change is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the product is the effect of how you change it changing <expression> and therefore changing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happens in real life if i change <expression> a little bit", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "well both <expression> and <expression> change at the same time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how does <expression> change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is the sum of the two effects", "entities": []}
{"text": "does that make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course if <expression> depends on more variables then you just have more terms in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is another thing that may be a little bit confusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is tempting", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is tempting here would be to simplify these formulas by removing these partial xs", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets simplify by partial <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "lets simplify by partial <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "we get partial <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "something is not working properly", "entities": []}
{"text": "why doesnt it work", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is precisely because these are partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are not total derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you cannot simplify them in that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is actually the reason why we use this <expression> rather than a <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "it is to remind us beware there are these simplifications that we can do with straight ds that are not legal here", "entities": []}
{"text": "somehow when you have a partial derivative you must resist the urge of simplifying things", "entities": []}
{"text": "no simplifications in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the simplest formula you can get", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "when would you use this and what does it describe", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it is basically when you have a function given in terms of a certain set of variables because maybe there is a simply expression in terms of those variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ultimately what you care about is not those variables <expression> and <expression> but another set of variables here <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> and <expression> are giving you a nice formula for <expression> but actually the relevant variables for your problem are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you know <expression> and <expression> are related to <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so of course what you could do is plug the formulas the way that we did substituting", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe that will give you very complicated expressions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe it is actually easier to just work with the derivates", "entities": []}
{"text": "the important claim here is basically we dont need to know the actual formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "all we need to know are the rate of changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we know all these rates of change then we know how to take these derivatives without actually having to plug in values", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes you could certain do the same things in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> and <expression> were functions of <expression> instead of being functions of <expression> and <expression> then it would be the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you would have the same formulas that i had well over there i still have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "why does that one have straight ds", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the answer is i could put <expression> if i wanted but i end up with a function of a single variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a single variable then the partial with respect to that variable is the same thing as the usual derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont actually need to worry about curly in that case", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that one is indeed special case of this one where instead of <expression> and <expression> depending on two variables <expression> and <expression> they depend on a single variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now of course you can call variables any name you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just a slight generalization of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well not quite because here i also had a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see i am trying to just confuse you by giving you functions that depend on various numbers of variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have a function of 30 variables things work the same way just longer and you are going to run out of letters in the alphabet before the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "what", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> and <expression> themselves depended on another variable then you would continue with your chain rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe you would know to express partial <expression> over partial <expression> in terms using that chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> and <expression> are dependent on yet another variable then you could get the derivative with respect to that using first the chain rule to pass from <expression> to that new variable and then you would plug in these formulas for partials of f with respect to <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 142, "end_offset": 152}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 156, "end_offset": 160}]}
{"text": "in fact if you have several substitutions to do you can always arrange to use one chain rule at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just have to do them in sequence", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why we dont actually learn that but you can just do it be repeating the process", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean probably at that stage the easiest to not get confused actually is to manipulate differentials because that is probably easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> does not exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> makes no sense by itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt exist alone", "entities": []}
{"text": "what exists is only <expression> some variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that accounts only for the rate of change with respect to that variable leaving the others fixed while straight <expression> is somehow a total variation of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it accounts for all of the partial derivatives and their combined effects", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "any more questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just finish up very quickly by telling you again one example where completely you might want to do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have a function that you want to switch between rectangular and polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "to make things a little bit concrete", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have polar coordinates that means in the plane instead of using <expression> and <expression> you will use coordinates <expression> distance to the origin and <expression> the angles from the xaxis", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 113}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 114, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"text": "the change of variables for that is <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that means if you have a function <expression> that depends on <expression> and <expression> in fact you can plug these in as a function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"text": "then you can ask yourself well what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is going to be well you want to take <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "that will end up being actually <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can do the same thing to find <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you can express derivatives either in terms of <expression> <expression> or in terms of <expression> and <expression> with simple relations between them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the one last thing i should say", "entities": []}
{"text": "on thursday we will learn about more tricks we can play with variations of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one that is important because you need to know it actually to do the pset is the gradient vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "the gradient vector is simply a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "you use this downward pointing triangle as the notation for the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is simply is a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean in a way you can think of a differential as a way to package partial derivatives together into some weird object", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the gradient is also a way to package partials together", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will see on thursday what it is good for but some of the problems on the pset use it", "entities": []}
{"text": " voiceover lets say that we have the differential equation <expression> or the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we dont know how to find the solutions to this but we at least want to get a sense of what the solutions might look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to do that what we could do is we could look at a coordinate plane so let me draw some axes here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me draw relatively straight line alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my yaxis and this is my xaxis", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me mark this as <expression> thats <expression> thats <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i could do is since this differential equation is just in terms of <expression> and <expression> and first derivatives of <expression> with respect to <expression> i could sample points on the coordinate plane i could look at the <expression> and <expression> coordinates substitute them in here figure out what the slope is going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i could visualize the slope if a solution goes through that point what the slope needs to be there and i can visualize that with a line segment a little small line segment that has the same slope as the slope in question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets actually do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me setup a little table here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do a little table here to do a bunch of <expression> and <expression> values", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again im just sampling some points on the coordinate plane to be able to visualize", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say when <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression> what is the derivative of  with<expression> respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression> so its just going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so at the point <expression> if a solution goes through this point its slope is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we can visualize that by doing a little horizontal line segment right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets keep going", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about when <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well then <expression> the derivative of <expression> with respect to <expression> is <expression> so its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at the point <expression> if a solution goes through that point it would have a slope of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i draw a little line segment that has a slope of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do this in a new color", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about when <expression> is <expression> and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well then its <expression> so this is actually undefined but its a clue that maybe the slope there if you had a tangent line at that point maybe its vertical", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill put that as a question mark vertical there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe its something like that if you actually did have i guess it wouldnt be a function if you had some kind of relation that went through it but lets not draw that just yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try some other points", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try the point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we have <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well youd have a slope of <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> youd have a slope of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about if you had <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now its <expression> your slope is now <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> if a solution goes through this its slope would look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we could keep going we could even do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to have a slope of one as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you did <expression> that would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd have a slope of <expression> right over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we could do a bunch of points just keep going", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im just doing them in my head im not going on the table", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you get a sense of whats going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "here youre slope what if it was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to have a slope of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at this point your slope <expression> so <expression> is <expression> so youre going to have a slope like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "at negative two two same exact idea it would look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so when you keep drawing these line segments over these kind of sample points in the cartesian or in the xy plane you start to get a sense of well what would a solution have to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can start to visualize that hey maybe a solution would have to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this would be a solution so maybe it would have to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if were looking only at functions and not relations ill make it so its very clear", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe it would have to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if the function started here based on what weve seen so far maybe it would have to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if this were a point on the function over here it would have to do something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and once again im doing this based on what the slope field is telling me", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this field that im creating where im sampling a bunch of points and im visualizing the slope with a line segement", "entities": []}
{"text": "once again this is called a slope field", "entities": []}
{"text": "so hopefully that gives you kind of the basic idea of what a slope field is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the next two videos well explore this idea even deeper", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression> <expression> and  okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "here is a lecture on the applications of eigenvalues and if i can  so that will be markov matrices", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you what a markov matrix is so this matrix a will be a markov matrix and ill explain how they come in applications", "entities": []}
{"text": "and  and then if i have time i would like to say a little bit about fourier series which is a fantastic application of the projection chapter", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats a markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i just write down a typical markov matrix say", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> <expression> lets say ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a  a totally just invented markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "what makes it a markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "two properties that this  this matrix has", "entities": []}
{"text": "so two properties are  <expression> every entry is greater  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all entries greater than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course when i square the matrix the entries will still be greater <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to be interested in the powers of this matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this property of course is going to  stay there", "entities": []}
{"text": "it  really markov matrices youll see are connected to probability ideas and probabilities are never negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other property  do you see the other property in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i add down the columns what answer do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all columns add to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all columns add to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually when i square the matrix that will be true again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that the powers of my matrix are all markov matrices and im interested in always the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this question of steady state will come up", "entities": []}
{"text": "you remember we had steady state for differential equations last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "when  what was the steady state  what was the eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "what was the eigenvalue in the differential equation case that led to a steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when  you remember that we did an example and one of the eigenvalues was <equation> and that  so then we had an <expression> a constant <expression>  as time went on there that thing stayed steady", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what  in the powers case its not a <expression> eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually with powers of a matrix a <expression> eigenvalue that part is going to die right away", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an eigenvalue of <expression> thats all important", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this steady state will correspond  will be totally connected with an eigenvalue of <expression> and its eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact the steady state will be the eigenvector for that eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats whats coming", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for some reason then that we have to see this matrix has an eigenvalue of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this property that the columns all add to <expression>  turns out  guarantees that <expression> is an eigenvalue so that you can actually find the eigenvalue  find that eigenvalue of a markov matrix without computing any determinants of <expression>  that matrix will have an eigenvalue of <expression> and we want to see why", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other thing is  so the key points  let me  let me write these underneath", "entities": []}
{"text": "the key points are  the key points are <equation> is an eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill add in a little  an additional  well a thing about eigenvalues  key point two the other eigenval values  all other eigenvalues are in magnitude smaller than <expression>  in absolute value smaller than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there could be some exceptional case when  when an eigen  another eigenvalue might have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it never has an eigenvalue larger than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these two facts  somehow we ought to  linear algebra ought to tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then of course linear algebra is going to tell us what the  whats  what happens if i take  if  you remember when i solve  when i multiply by <expression> time after time the kth thing is <expression> and im asking whats special about this  these powers of <expression> and very likely the quiz will have a problem to computer <expression> to computer some powers of <expression> or  or applied to an initial vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you remember the general form", "entities": []}
{"text": "the general form is that theres some amount of the first eigenvalue to the kth power times the first eigenvector and another amount of the second eigenvalue to the kth power times the second eigenvector and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "a  just  my conscience always makes me say at least once per lecture that this requires a complete set of eigenvectors otherwise we might not be able to expand u0 in the eigenvectors and we couldnt get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "but once were started with <expression> when <expression> is <expression> then every <expression> brings in these <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you can see what the steady state is going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is <expression>  so <equation> and these other eigenvalues are smaller than <expression>  so ive sort of scratched over the equation there to  we had this term but what happens to this term  if the lambdas smaller than <expression> then the  when  as we take powers as we iterate as we  as we go forward in time this goes to <expression> can i just  having scratched over it i might as well scratch right", "entities": []}
{"text": "further", "entities": []}
{"text": "that term and all the other terms are going to <expression> because all the other eigenvalues are smaller than <expression> and the steady state that were approaching is just  whatever there was  this was  this was the  this is the <expression> part of un of the initial condition <expression>  is the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "this much we know from general  from  you know what weve already done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to see why  lets at least see number <expression> why <expression> is an eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres actually  in this chapter were interested not only in eigenvalues but also eigenvectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres something special about the eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write down what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the eigenvector <expression>  <expression> is the eigenvector and all its components are positive so the steady state is positive if the start was", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the start was  so  well actually in general i  this might have a  might have some component <expression> always but no negative components in that eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i come to that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "how can i look at that matrix  so that was just an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "how could i be sure  how can i see that a matrix  if the columns add to <expression>  add to <expression> sorry  if the columns add to <expression> this property means that <equation> is an eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just think that through", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i saying about  let me ca let me look at <expression> and if i believe that <expression> is an eigenvalue then i should be able to subtract off <expression> times the identity and then i would get a matrix thats what ", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 144}]}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>  wh i took the <expression> away and the other parts of course are still what they were and this is still", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and  okay whats  whats up with this matrix now", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive shifted the matrix this markov matrix by <expression> by the identity and what do i want to prove", "entities": []}
{"text": "i  what is it that i believe this matrix  about this matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "i believe its singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "singular will  if <expression> is singular that tells me that <expression> is an eigenvalue right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the eigenvalues are the numbers that i subtract off  the shifts  the numbers that i subtract from the diagonal  to make it singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why is that matrix singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "i  we could compute its determinant but we want to see a reason that would work for every markov matrix not just this particular random example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it about that matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i guess you could look at its columns now  what do they add up to", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the columns add to <expression> so all columns  let me put all columns now of  of  of <expression> add to <expression> and then i want to realize that this means <expression> is singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "why", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could i  you know that could be a quiz question a sort of theoretical quiz question", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i give you a matrix and i tell you all its columns add to <expression> give me a reason because it is true that the matrix is singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess actually  now what  i think of  you know im thinking of <expression> or <expression> ways to see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "how would you do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont want to take its determinant somehow", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the matrix to be singular well it means that these <expression> columns are dependent right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the determinant will be <expression> when those <expression> columns are dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "you see were  were at a point in this course now where we have several ways to look at an idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can take the determinant  here we dont want to", "entities": []}
{"text": "b but we met singular before that  those columns are dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do i see that those columns are dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "they all add to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "lets see whew  well oh actually what  another thing i know is that the  i would like to be able to show is that the rows are dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe thats easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i know that all the columns add to <expression> thats my information how do i see that those <expression> rows are linearly dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "what  what combination of those rows gives the <expression> row", "entities": []}
{"text": "how  how could i combine those <expression> rows  those <expression> row vectors to produce the <expression> row vector", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and that would tell me those rows are dependent therefore the columns are dependent the matrix is singular the determinant is <expression>  well you see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just add the rows", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "<expression> times that row plus <expression> times that row plus <expression> times that row  its the <expression> row", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rows are dependent", "entities": []}
{"text": "in a way that <expression> because its multiplying the rows is like an eigenvector in the  its in the left null space right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is in the left null space", "entities": []}
{"text": "its singular because the rows are dependent  and can i just keep the reasoning going", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this vector <expression> is  its not in the null space of the matrix but its in the null space of the transpose  is in the null space of the transpose", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats good enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have a square matrix  if we have a square matrix and the rows are dependent that matrix is singular", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it turned out that the immediate guy we could identify was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course the  there will be somebody in the null space too", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually who will it be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats  so  so now i want to ask about the null space of  of the matrix itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "what combination of the columns gives <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i  i dont want to compute it because i just made up this matrix and  it will  it would take me a while  it looks sort of doable because its <expression> by <expression> but wh my point is what  what vector is it if we  once weve found it what have we got thats in the  in the null space of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the eigenvector right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats where we find <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then <expression> the eigenvector is in the null space of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how we find eigenvectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so those <expression> columns must be dependent  some combination of columns  of those <expression> columns is the <expression> column and that  the <expression> components in that combination are the eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that guy is the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im happy about the  the thinking here but i havent given  i havent completed it because i havent found <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its there", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i  another thought came to me as i was doing this another little comment that  you  about eigenvalues and eigenvectors because of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what can you tell me about eigenvalues of <expression>  of <expression> and eigenvalues of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre  so this is a little comment  we  its useful since eigenvalues are generally not easy to find  its always useful to know some cases where youve got them where  and this is  if you know the eigenvalues of <expression> then you know the eigenvalues of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "eigenvalues of <expression> are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and can i just like review why that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to find the eigenvalues of <expression> this would be determinate of <equation> that gives me an eigenvalue of <expression>  now how can i get <expression> into the picture here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill use the fact that the determinant of a matrix and the determinant of its transpose are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "the determinant of a matrix  the determinant of a  of the transpose", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was property ten the very last guy in our determinant list", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill transpose that matrix", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "this leads to  i just take the matrix and transpose it but now what do i get when i transpose <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 51}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "i just get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats  thats all there was to the reasoning", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reasoning is that the eigenvalues of <expression> solved that equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "the determinant of a matrix is the determinant of its transpose so that gives me this equation and that tells me that the same lambdas are eigenvalues of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that backing up to the markov case <expression> is an eigenvalue of <expression> transpose and we actually found its eigenvector <expression> and that tell us that <expression> is also an eigenvalue of <expression>  but of course it has a different eigenvector the  the left null space isnt the same as the null space and we would have to find it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres some vector here which is <expression> that produces <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually it wouldnt be that hard to find you know i  as im talking im thinking okay i going to follow through and actually find it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i can tell from this one  look if i put a point six there and a point seven there thats what  then ill be okay in the last row right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i only  remains to find one guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me take the first row then", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>  theres some big number going in there right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have  just to make the first row come out <expression> im getting <expression> so that was <expression> and what  what do i want", "entities": []}
{"text": "like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the first time in the history of linear algebra that an eigenvector has every had a component <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i guess its true", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then i multiply by <expression>  oh no it was <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so is this just  oh shoot", "entities": []}
{"text": "only <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "only <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so theres the eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh and notice that it  that it turned  did turn out at least to be all positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that was like the theory  predicts that part too", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wont give the proof of that part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>  <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now those are the ma thats the linear algebra part", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i get to the applications", "entities": []}
{"text": "where do these markov matrices come from", "entities": []}
{"text": "because thats  thats part of this course and absolutely part of this lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so wheres  whats an application of markov matrices", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "markov matrices  so my equation then that im solving and studying is this equation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now <expression> is a markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "a is markov", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to give an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "can i just create an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its one ive used before because it seems to me to bring out the idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  because we have <expression> by <expression> we have <expression> states lets say california and massachusetts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im looking at the populations in those two states the people in those two states california and massachusetts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my matrix a is going to tell me in a  in a year some movement has happened", "entities": []}
{"text": "some people stayed in massachusetts some people moved to california some smart people moved from california to massachusetts some people stayed in california and made a billion", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that  theres a matrix there with four entries and those tell me the fractions of my population  so im making  im going to use fractions so they wont be negative of course because  because only positive people are in involved here  and theyll add up to one because im accounting for all people", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why i have these two key properties", "entities": []}
{"text": "the entries are greater  <expression> because im looking at probabilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "do they move do they stay", "entities": []}
{"text": "those probabilities are all between <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the probabilities add to one because everybodys accounted for", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not losing anybody gaining anybody in this markov chain", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  it conserves the total population", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what would be a typical matrix then", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this would be u california and u massachusetts at time <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its some matrix which well think of times <expression> california and <expression> massachusetts at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice this matrix is going to stay the same you know forever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a severe limitation on the example", "entities": []}
{"text": "the example has a  the same markov matrix the same probabilities act at every time", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats a reasonable say  say point nine of the people in california at time <expression> stay there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> of the people in california move to massachusetts", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice why that column added to <expression> because weve now accounted for all the people in california at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "nine tenths of them are still in california one tenth are here at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the people who are in massachusetts", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is going to multiply column two right by our fundamental rule of multiplying matrix by vector its the  its the population in massachusetts", "entities": []}
{"text": "shall we say that  that after the red sox fail again eight  only <expression> percent of the people in massachusetts stay and <expression> percent move to california", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again this adds to one which accounts for all people in massachusetts where they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is a markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "nonnegative entries adding to one", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "if everybody started in massachusetts say at  you know when the pilgrims showed up or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "then where are they now", "entities": []}
{"text": "where are they at time <expression> lets say or maybe  i dont know how many years since the pilgrims", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and something", "entities": []}
{"text": "or  and actually where will they be like way out a million years from now", "entities": []}
{"text": "i  i could multiply  take the powers of this matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact youll  you would  ought to be able to figure out what is the hundredth power of that matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "why dont we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me follow the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what  whats my starting  my starting <expression> at time <expression> is shall we say  shall we put anybody in california", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets make  lets make <expression> there and say the population of massachusetts is  lets say <expression> just to  okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the population is  so the populations are <expression> and <expression> at the start", "entities": []}
{"text": "what can you tell me about this population after  after <expression> steps", "entities": []}
{"text": "what will <expression> add to", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those thousand people are always accounted for", "entities": []}
{"text": "but  so <expression> will start dropping from <expression> and <expression> will start growing", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually we could see  why dont we figure out what it is after one", "entities": []}
{"text": "after one time step what are the populations at time one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens in one step", "entities": []}
{"text": "you multiply once by that matrix and lets see <expression> times this column  so its just <expression> times this column so i think were getting <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so after the first step <expression> people have  are in california", "entities": []}
{"text": "now at the following step ill multiply again by this matrix  more people will move to california", "entities": []}
{"text": "some people will move back", "entities": []}
{"text": "twenty people will come back and the  the net result will be that the california population will be above <expression> and the massachusetts below <expression> and theyll still add up to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do that a few times", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do that <expression> times", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the population", "entities": []}
{"text": "well okay to answer any question like that i need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors right", "entities": []}
{"text": "as soon as ive  ive created an example but as soon as i want to solve anything i have to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and tell me its eigenvalues", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>   so tell me one eigenvalue", "entities": []}
{"text": "one thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "and tell me the other one", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the other eigenvalue  from the trace or the determinant  from the  i  the trace is what  is like easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the trace of that matrix is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the other eigenvalue is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it  notice that its less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice that that determinant is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is point <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now to find the eigenvectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is  so thats <expression> and the eigenvector  ill subtract <expression> from the diagonal right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "so can i do that in light let  in light here", "entities": []}
{"text": "subtract one from the diagonal i have <expression> and <expression> and of course these are still there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im looking for its  heres  heres  this is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the null space of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay everybody sees that its <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now how about  so that  and it  notice that that eigenvector is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually we can jump to infinity right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the population at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a multiple  this is  this eigenvector is giving the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "its some multiple of this and how is that multiple decided", "entities": []}
{"text": "by adding up to a thousand people", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the steady state the <expression>  this is the <expression> but that adds up to <expression> so i really want two  its going to be <expression> and <expression> making a total of <expression> people", "entities": []}
{"text": "thatll be the steady state", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats really all i need to know at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if i want to know whats happened after just a finite number like <expression> steps id better find this eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so can i  can i look at  ill subtract <expression> time  ti from the diagonal and ill get that and ill look at the null space of that one and i  and this is going to give me <expression> now and what is it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "so whats in the null space of  thats certainly singular so i know my calculation is right and  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im prepared now to write down the solution after <expression> time steps", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "the  the populations after <expression> time steps right", "entities": []}
{"text": "can  can we remember the <expression>  the  the one with this <expression> eigenvector and the point <expression> with the <expression> eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill  let me  ill just write it above here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> after <expression> steps is some multiple of <expression> to the <expression> times the <expression> eigenvector and some multiple of point <expression> times the <expression> eigenvector", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats  i  this is how i take  how powers of a matrix work", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i apply those powers to a <expression> what i  so its <expression> which was <expression>  that has to be corrected <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so im plugging in <equation> and i get <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> equations <expression> constants certainly independent eigenvectors so theres a solution and you see what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see i guess we already figured that <expression> was <expression> i think  did we think that had to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe <expression> would be  excuse me let  get an eraser  we can  i just  i think weve  get it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we want to get a <expression> here so maybe we need plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think that has to work", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thatll give us the <expression> and <expression> and the <expression> will give us <expression> the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what we approach  this part with the point kth power is the part thats disappearing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats  thats markov matrices", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats an example of where they come from from modeling movement of people with no gain or loss with total  total count conserved", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i  just if i can add one more comment because youll see markov matrices in electrical engineering courses and often youll see them  sorry heres my little comment", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes  in a lot of applications they prefer to work with row vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they  instead of  this was natural for us right", "entities": []}
{"text": "for all the eigenvectors to be column vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our columns added to <expression> in the markov matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "just so you dont think well what  whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we work with row vectors and we multiply vector times matrix  so were multiplying from the left  then itll be the then well be using the transpose of  of this matrix and itll be the rows that add to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other textbooks youll see  instead of col columns adding to <expression> youll see rows add to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay thats what i wanted to say about markov now i want to say something about projections and even leading in  a little into fourier series", "entities": []}
{"text": "because  but before any fourier stuff let me make a comment about projections", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  so this is a comment about projections onto  with an orthonormal basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so of course the basis vectors are <expression> up to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let  let me imagine  let me imagine this is a basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "let  lets say im in <expression> by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im  ive got eh <expression> orthonormal vectors im in <expression> dimensional space so theyre a complete  theyre a basis  any vector <expression> could be expanded in this basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so any vector <expression> is some combination some amount of <expression> plus some amount of <expression> plus some amount of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so any <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just want you to tell me what those amounts are", "entities": []}
{"text": "what are <expression>  whats <expression> for example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im looking for the expansion", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is  this is really our projection", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could  i could really use the word expansion", "entities": []}
{"text": "im expanding the vector in the basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the special thing about the basis is that its orthonormal", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that should give me a special formula for the answer for the coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what  whats a formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could  i can go through the projection  the <expression> all that  normal equations but  and ill get  ill come out with this nice answer that i think i can see right away", "entities": []}
{"text": "how can i pick  get a hold of <expression> and get these other <expression>s out of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how can i get a nice simple formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we want to see sure we knew that all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the good way is take the inner product of everything with <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "take the inner product of that whole equation every term with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what will happen to that last term", "entities": []}
{"text": "the inner product  when  if i take the dot product with <expression> i get <expression> right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "because this basis was orthonormal", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take the dot product with <expression> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "if i take the dot product with <expression> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so that tells me what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> transpose <expression> thats taking the dot product is <expression> plus a bunch of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and this is a one so i can forget that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression> immediately", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  do you see what im saying  is that i have an orthonormal basis then the coefficient that i need for each basis vector is a cinch to find", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me  let me just  i have to put this into matrix language too so youll see it there also", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i write that first equation in matrix language what  what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "im writing  in matrix language this equation says im taking these columns  are  are you guys good at this now", "entities": []}
{"text": "im taking those columns times the <expression> and getting <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the matrix form", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay thats the matrix <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the solution to that equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  of course its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression> but whats the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in this case is going to  is simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have to work to invert this matrix <expression> because of the fact that the  these columns are orthonormal i know the inverse to that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 41}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "and it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you see a <expression> a square matrix with that letter <expression> the  that just triggers  <expression> is the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first component then  the first component of <expression> is the first row times <expression> and whats that", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first component of this answer is the first row of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just  thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what we concluded here too", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so nothing fourier here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the  the key ingredient here was that the <expression>s are orthonormal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now thats what fourier series are built on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now in the remaining time let me say something about fourier series", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so fourier series is  well weve got a function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want to write it as a combination of  maybe it has a constant term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it has some <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it has some <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it has some <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a  and some <expression> and forever", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats  whats the difference between this type problem and the one above it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this ones infinite but the key property of things being orthogonal is still true for <expression> and <expression> so its the property that makes fourier series work", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats called a fourier series", "entities": []}
{"text": "better write his name up", "entities": []}
{"text": "fourier series", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it was joseph fourier who realized that hey i could work in function space", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of a vector <expression> i could have a function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead of orthogonal vectors <expression> <expression>  <expression> i could have orthogonal functions the constant the <expression> the <expression> the <expression> but infinitely many of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need infinitely many because my space is infinite dimensional", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is like the moment in which we leave finite dimensional vector spaces and go to infinite dimensional vector spaces and our basis  so the vectors are now functions  and of course there are so many functions that its  that weve got an infin infinite dimensional space  and the basis vectors are functions too", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> the constant function one  so my basis is <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason fourier series is a success is that those are orthogonal", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what do i mean by orthogonal", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know what it means for two vectors to be orthogonal  <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "dot product  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "but whats the dot product of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "im claiming that whatever it is the dot product  or we would more likely use the word inner product of say <expression> with <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> with <expression> also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i  let me tell you what i mean by that by that dot product", "entities": []}
{"text": "well how do i compute a dot product", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so lets just remember for vectors <expression> trans <expression> for vectors so this was vectors <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "vnwn", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "now functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i have <expression> functions lets call them <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats with them now", "entities": []}
{"text": "the vectors had n components but the functions have a whole like continuum", "entities": []}
{"text": "to graph the function i just dont have <expression> points ive got this whole graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have functions  im really trying to ask you whats the inner product of this function <expression> with another function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to make it parallel to this the best i can", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the best parallel is to multiply <expression> at every <expression>  and here i just had n multiplications but here im going to have a whole range of <expression>s and here i added the results", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do i do here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the analog of addition when you have  when youre in a continuum", "entities": []}
{"text": "its integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that the  the dot product of <expression> functions will be the integral of those functions <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i have to say  say well what are the limits of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for this fourier series this function <expression>  if im going to have  if that right hand side is going to be <expression> that function that im seeing on the right all those <expression> and <expression> theyre all periodic with  with period <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so thats what <expression> had better be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill integrate from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "my  all  everything  is on the interval <expression> now because if im going to use these <expression> and <expression> then <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is periodic  periodic functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i know what  ive got all the right words now", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got a vector space but the vectors are functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got inner products and  and the inner product gives a number all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just happens to be an integral instead of a sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got  and that  then i have the idea of orthogonality  because actually just  lets just check", "entities": []}
{"text": "orthogonality  if i take the integral  s i  let me do <expression>  <expression> from <expression> to <expression>  i think we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the differential of that so it would be <expression> was that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "between <expression> and <expression>  and of course we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the same would be true with a little more  some trig identities to help us out  of every other pair", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have now an orthonormal infinite basis for function space and all we want to do is express a function in that basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i  the end of my lecture is okay what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the coefficient  how much <expression> is there in a function compared to the other harmonics", "entities": []}
{"text": "how much constant is in that function", "entities": []}
{"text": "thatll  that would be an easy question", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer <expression> will come out to be the average value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the amount of the constant thats in there its average value", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets take <expression> as more typical", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "how will i get  heres the end of the lecture then  how do i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first fourier coefficient", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do just as i did in the vector case", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take the inner product of everything with <expression> take the inner product of everything with <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 79}]}
{"text": "then on the left  on the left i have  the inner product is the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and on the right what do i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i  so what i  when i say take the inner product with <expression> let me put it in ordinary calculus words", "entities": []}
{"text": "multiply by <expression> and integrate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "thats what inner products are", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i multiply that whole thing by <expression> and <expression> integrate i get a whole lot of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "the only thing that survives is that term", "entities": []}
{"text": "all the others disappear", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  and that term is <expression> times the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so weve been developing the procedure to describe a quantum gas of identical particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our noninteracting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does that mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that we are thinking about the hamiltonian for a system of <expression> particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "if they are not interacting it can be written as the sum of the contributions for the individual particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if they are identical its basically the same particle for each one of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "same hamiltonian for each one of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we handle these", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you regard this as a quantum problem for a single particle so for each one of these hamiltonians we can find the eigenstates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a bunch of states that say label by <expression> because we are ultimately have in mind the plane waves that describe gas particles in a box", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there is corresponding energy levels for the single particles <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the single particle spectrum can therefore can be described by a bunch of energies a lot of energy levels with different values of <expression> and different allowed discretized energies", "entities": []}
{"text": "now when we want to describe a case of <expression> particles that are noninteracting we said that we could in principle pick one <expression> here one <expression> here one <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if we are dealing with bosons potentially more than one at each side", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the state would then be described by a bunch of occupation numbers <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> will be <expression> or <expression> if you are talking about fermions but any integer if you are talking about bosons", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> being plus or minus was used to distinguish appropriate symmetrization or antisymmetrization", "entities": []}
{"text": "now once we have a state such as this clearly the <expression> particle hamintonium acting on a state that is symmetrized with these bunch of occupation numbers will give us back this state", "entities": []}
{"text": "the energy that we would be getting is summing over all possible <expression> values epsilon <expression> times the number of occurrance of that in this state", "entities": []}
{"text": "again multiplying this state back", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course we have a constraint that the number of particles matches the sum of the occupation numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then we said ok this is just a description of the state that they want to describe or the set of states that represent this system of identical noninteracting partners in quantum mechanics", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next stage we want to do some kind of first statistics for them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we had seen that basically in order to assign appropriate statistics in case of quantum systems we have to deal with a density matrix", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we saw that in the canonical representation the density matrix is complicated and amounts to some kind of interaction among particles", "entities": []}
{"text": "although there is no interaction at this level the symmetrization or antisymmetrization create states that are intermixed in a manner that appears as if you have an interaction", "entities": []}
{"text": "we found that however we could get rid of that by going to the grand canonical ensemble where we would trade in the constraint that the number of particles is fixed with a chemical potential", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in this ensemble we found that the density matrix is diagonal in this representation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the diagonal elements can be thought of as the probability of one of these occupation number sets", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the probability of a particular set of occupations in this grand canonical prescription is proportional to e to the beta of course we have mu if we are going to this grand canonical ensemble <expression> and then we had <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the probability that a particular one of these is occupied <expression> times in this grand canonical prescription is simply an exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course the different <expression> levels are completely independent of each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the probability factor arises in this fashion", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course as any probability we have to normalize this", "entities": []}
{"text": "normalization is appropriate", "entities": []}
{"text": "we call the grand canonical partition function and will be different whether we are dealing with boson statistics or fermion statistics", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually because we have a structure such as this q is going to be the product of the normalization of each individual one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore <expression> is going to be a sum of the contributions that i would get for the normalization of each individual ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course the log of whatever normalization i have for the individual one", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i have the case of a fermions where <expression> gets <expression> or <expression> as the two possibilities then the normalization will be simply <expression> plus this exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i choose to write that as <expression> where i have introduced <expression> to be <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "because this combination occurs all the time i dont want to keep repeating that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this was for the case of fermions", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the case of bosons where <expression> goes <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> et cetera this is a geometric series", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the geometric series when i sum it i would get <expression> over this factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i take the log i will have a minus sign here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and i can put the boson and fermi cases together by simply putting a factor of <expression> here so that i have the plus for the case of fermions and the minus for the case of bosons", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is one thing that we will be using", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other thing is that this is the probability for this level having a certain occupation number", "entities": []}
{"text": "in k we can always ask what is the average of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "and from this probability it is easy to calculate the average", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer again can be collapsed into one expression for the case of bosons and fermions as <expression> encompassing both fermions and bosons", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these results give some idea both at the microscopic level in terms of occupation numbers of these different levels and macroscopic level a grand partition function from which we can construct thermodynamics", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually full probability again in this ensemble which we can transform in principle and get density matrices et cetera in other basis", "entities": []}
{"text": "but these are the kinds of things that we can do for any interacting hamiltonian", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what i said over here was that im actually interested in the case of a gas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets again think about the type of gas such as the one in this room that we are interested", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again to make a contrast with something that we may want to do later lets emphasize that it is a nonrelativistic gas", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the hamiltonian <expression> is essentially free particle in a box of volume <expression> the thing that we have been using all the time just the kinetic energy of a one particle state", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for that we know that the single particle energy levels are characterized by a vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "as three components in fact", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and weve discussed what the discretization of <expression> is appropriate to the size of the box", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wont go over that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again maybe it is important to mention that because of the discretizatoin of the <expression> values the spacing between possible values of <expression> are <expression> in each direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ultimately what we want to do is to replace these sums over <expression> in the limit of large boxes with integrals over <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "so these go over to an integral over <expression> times the density factor that you get in going from the sum to the integral which is <expression> times the volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will introduce one other factor here which is that when we are talking about quantum particles and bosons and fermions they are typically assigned also another state another parameter that characterizes their spin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and depending on the possible values of spin you will have <expression> copies of the system", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this <expression> will be related to the quantum spin to the formula <expression> so that when you have fermions typically <expression> is half integer and this will be an even number", "entities": []}
{"text": "whereas for bosons it will be an odd number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats again something that weve seen", "entities": []}
{"text": "you just essentially says multiply everything by some factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i go through this procedure that i have outlined here i will ultimately get the grand partition function of the gas which as we will see is related to its pressure in terms of the chemical potential", "entities": []}
{"text": "throughout the course weve seen that the more interesting thing to look at is how things depend on density rather than chemical potential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so id better use this result to get what the density is", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well once i have determined what the chemical potential is the average number of particles will be the sum over and the average occupation numbers that i have in all of these states", "entities": []}
{"text": "and according to the prescription that we have over here in the limit of a large box this sum over <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ultimately i will divide by <expression> so i will have the formula for the density", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have the formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> and then i have a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i divide through by <expression> really i will have the density", "entities": []}
{"text": "get rid of this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have to do that integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "now for this and a lot of other things you can see that always i will have sums or integrations over the combination that appears in the exponent and enhances dimension list which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me introduce a new variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me call <expression> to be the combination <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so im going to call this <expression> if you like", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so i have changed variables from <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in terms of <expression> is simply <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i took a square root so its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i realize that <expression> is in fact <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> i can put in the numerator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "and then i remember that actually the combination <expression> i was calling these thermal wavelength <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> should have the dimensions of an inverse landscape so thats the appropriate thing to choose", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take <expression> inside and im left with <expression> divided by this parameter <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "again for later clarity lets make sure we remember this was our <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the variable <expression> that i need", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact for the for the integration i have to also make a change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i not that <expression> if i take a derivative here i will get <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "actually the factor that i need over here is <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now everything only depends on the magnitude of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will take advantage of spherical symmetry write <expression> as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "and then i substitute from <expression> and <expression> above in terms of this <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so i will have a <expression> from this division", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is simply <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see lots of things cancel out and the answer is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is left from all of these <expression> et cetera is a factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <expression> in the numerator or <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i do these set of changes that i have on the right part of the board what do i have for density", "entities": []}
{"text": "the density becomes simply <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have this integral over <expression> that i have recast as an integral that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me pull out the factor of <expression> on the outside", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will pull out to that factor of <expression> that i had before", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and then i have the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me write it in this fashion", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the denominator what do i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> universe into the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we did all of these and we ended up with an integral that we dont recognize", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we are going to do is to pretend that we recognize it and give it a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we define a set of functions <expression> of variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "once i do the integration over <expression> i will get a function of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so that function of <expression> i will call <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "but clearly i have a different <expression> if i have <expression> or <expression> for bosons of fermions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there is two classes of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i had the integral <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it turns out that you will get a whole bunch of these integrals where the inaudible that is out front in the numerator is different", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will generalize this <expression> this <expression> to something that ill call it <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if these normalized so that what is in front is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are very important functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "everything we will do later on we will be expressing in terms of these functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "now clearly what is happening here corresponds to <expression> being  <expression> or <expression> being <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is this normalization", "entities": []}
{"text": "well for the normalization if this is <expression> i would need <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you go and look at the various definitions that we have for the gamma function or the factorial you can check that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed we saw this already when we wrote the expression for the surface area in general dimensions that involved factorial function appearing as fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in order to get the right result in two or three dimensions you can check that this <expression> is correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "so indeed i already have this <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was properly normalized", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the whole thing here can be written as <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the expression that relates the density to the chemical potential or this communication <expression> which is <expression> or the fugacity is simply this nice formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what we want is to calculate something like the pressure for the gas", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me remind you that <expression> essentially quite generally <expression> comes from normalizing something that is like mu times the total number of particles minus the energy you can kind of read that from here and then there would be <expression> from the number of states", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was the general formula that we had", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when we substitute for a system that is extensive where <expression> for a gas is <expression> we see that the <expression> of the partition function is simply the combination <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "of course again this pressure as a function of density or chemical potential would be different whether we are thinking about bosons of fermions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it can be calculated from the kind of sum that we have over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression> which is something like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "is obtained by doing this sum over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will get first of all i have the <expression> inaudible with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the volume factor cancels because i divided by volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> again <expression> are the energy that im dealing with", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do we do with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "we make the same change of variables that we have over here from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then i would have <expression> gets replaced with this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have the integral <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "huh", "entities": []}
{"text": "it seems like yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience what happened to your factor <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "professor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i was hoping to have integrals that are all expressible in terms of this these set of functions that i defined", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> does not fall into this category", "entities": []}
{"text": "should i define something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the answer is no because i can make that integral look like this by simbly doing an integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we do integrate by parts in which case what i do is i take a derivative of this and i take an integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 93}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "integral of <expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is of course a minus sign involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this minus becomes plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "make sure i have the <expression> this time", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have the integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> to the <expression> became <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> i will bring out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have to take the derivative of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression> times the derivative of the argument of the <expression> which is <expression> the derivative of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this minus becomes plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets arrange things a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can get rid of these etas because eta squared will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is the answer therefore", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> and i multiply <expression> with <expression> what i will get is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "because <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what do i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> divide the numerator and denominator by <expression> and you get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "and lo and behold we have a function of the variety that we had defined on the board corresponding to <expression> being <expression> or <expression> being <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we have here is that <expression> depending on whatever statistics we are dealing with is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience inaudible professor ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what you have to do is always ensure what is happening to the boundary terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "boundary terms will be a product of <expression> and this factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> <expression> will ensure that you are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <expression> goes to infinity the exponential will ensure that youre to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the boundary terms are important and indeed you have to check them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can check that they are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience i think the factor that multiples <expression> is inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its the argument still holds", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor the argument still holds because as <expression> goes to infinity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact you can ask how does it go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes to <expression> exponentially", "entities": []}
{"text": "exponentially it will inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you for the correction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres one other thing that we can take a look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "the total energy", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the energy in each one of these states is given by that formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i ask what is the total expectation value of energy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again in thermodynamics we expect the extensive quantities such as the energy should have in an aerodynamic sense well defined values so i wont write the expectation value", "entities": []}
{"text": "is going to be a sum over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this will depend on the statistics that im looking at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i will have is that this will go over to an integral over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have epsilon of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the expectation value of <expression> which is <expression> sorry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the simplest way to do this is to first of all divide by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can define an energy density", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "actually since im going to change variables to this combination that is <expression> i notice that up to a factor of betas the numerator is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me actually calculate the combination <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "that only depends on this combination <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is g the integral over <expression> i know how to replace it with something that involves <expression> is going to give me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "integral <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from the change of variables i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i introduced one factor of <expression> here because i have this energy factor in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that changes this to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then again i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if is one of the integrals that we have defined", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact it is exactly what i have above for the pressure except that i dont have the factor of <expression> that appeared nicely to give the right normalization", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i conclude is that this quantity is in fact <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "but they are exactly the same functions for energy and pressure", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that irrespective of what the chemical potential is doing i can state that for the quantum system <expression> is always <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course we have seen this expression classically", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happens quantum mechanically is that the pressure starts to vary in some complicated way with density", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what we learn is that energy will also vary in the same complicated way with density such that always this formula <expression> is valid", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is some nice symmetry reason for why that is the case that you explore in one of the problems that you will see", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the characteristics", "entities": []}
{"text": "in some sense we have solved the problem because we know both density and pressure in terms of chemical potential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all we need to do is to invert this get the chemical potential as a function of density insert it in the formula for pressure and we have pressure as a function of density", "entities": []}
{"text": "but since these are kind of implicit through these f functions we dont quite know what that means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next stage is to really study how these f functions behave and how we can relate their behaviors to dependence on density", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will see that we have to distinguish between low density and high density regimes", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does it mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can see that both have players on the right hand side is dimensionless", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only dimension full combination that we have here is <expression> well we can make it dimensionless by multiplying by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it turns out that whether or not you see things that are classical or things that are very quantum mechanical depend on this degeneracy factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "which within our context of statistical physics of gases we define to be the communication <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will regain classical behaviors when degeneracy is small density is small enough such that <expression> is much less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will see totally new behavior that is appropriate to quantum mechanics in other limit where ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": " becomes large", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this distinguishes classical versus quantum behavior", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we expect to regain classical behavior in the limit of very low densities", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what weve been kind of saying from the very first lecture that low density gas has this ideal behavior where <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore lets focus on the limit where <expression> is much less than <expression> which is classical", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since <expression> is <expression> we need the behavior of the function when it is small and ill show you inaudible consistently that the function is small when its argument is small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well see that <expression> less than <expression> implies or is implied by <expression> being less than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a look at one of these functions <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and id like to explore the limit of this when <expression> is small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats currently not very good because i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i will do is i will multiply by <expression> both numerator and denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will have <expression> integral <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have oops there was an <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i say well the thing that is appearing in the denominator i can write as a sum of a geometric series in powers of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats after all what im attempting to do make an expansion in powers of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it starts with <expression> to the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> i can write as the sum alpha going from <expression> to <expression> inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "this geometric series sums to what i have over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets rearrange this a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will take the sum over alpha outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i notice that actually i have here this first term which is different from this by a factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me multiply by an <expression> and get another <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have a sum that starts from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have one other <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have the integration over <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i didnt write <expression> because i pulled it out the integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will write it now", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i didnt write <expression> factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "now once more this is an integration that you have seen", "entities": []}
{"text": "the result of doing integral <expression> is simply <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "except that it is not <expression> but its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can rescale everything by <expression> and i will pull out a factor of <expression> to there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have that <expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": "power series ", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": " representation <expression> running from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an alternating series that starts with plus and then becomes a minus et cetera", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i were to explicitly write this you will see how nice it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see why it is such a nice thing that really deserves to have a function named after it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we call that nice series ", "entities": []}
{"text": "to vf", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": " now for future reference note the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take a derivative of this function with respect to <expression> its argument then in this power series say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> will cancel one of the <expression> that i have here and it becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that the coefficients that were powers of m become powers of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "numerator has gone down by one factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets multiply by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the numerator is now what it was before", "entities": []}
{"text": "the denominators rather than being raised to the power of <expression> are raised to the power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so clearly this is the same thing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so basically these functions have this nice character that they are like a ladder", "entities": []}
{"text": "you take a derivative of one and you get the one that is indexed by one less", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience is there a factor of eta that comes out to be inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor in the derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience i mean it seems to me that theres an eta like in that relation that professor in this relation", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it by step", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take a derivative divide <expression> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "then i multiply by <expression> this becomes <expression> this becomes <expression> this becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and you can see that the etas are exactly where they should be", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience would you explain why the index of summation starts from professor one", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience one", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a look at this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see there is a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i made it into a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that if <expression> is very small if will start with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happened here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wrote this as a sum of geometric series", "entities": []}
{"text": "i pulled out this factor of <expression> that was in the numerator and the denominator i wrote as a series that starts with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then there is this <expression> out front", "entities": []}
{"text": "i pulled this <expression> in front here and then it starts with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could have written it i can put this in here and write it as <expression> with <expression> starting from <expression> et cetera", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "or i can write it inaudible", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "or alternatively you can say lets put the <expression> here and <expression> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and then i see that this is the geometric series where the first term is this <expression> inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to erase this board but keep this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me erase it and then rewrite it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so this i will rewrite as <expression> which is my degeneracy factor is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and in the limit where <expression> goes to small i can use the expansion that i just derived which is <expression> to the what is it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can see that precisely because as <expression> goes to <expression> this series goes to <expression> that smallness of <expression> is the same thing or implied by the smallness of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that <expression>  <expression> only at the lowest order", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens at higher orders <expression> inverting this is <expression> and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we saw this when i was doing the calculation for the interacting gas that clearly to lowest order <equation> if i want to get the next order i substitute the result of the previous order into this expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> i substitute for <expression> i will <expression> as the first contribution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and then something that is order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i want the answer to the <expression> order i take this whole thing that is that order of <expression> and substitute in this series", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "and so what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will get <expression> which is the square of this quantity square of this quantity is <expression> minus twice the product of these two terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have twice <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then square of this term but thats order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont care for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have from here plus <expression> ignoring terms of the order of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is audience inaudible <equation> inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor ah great", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "saves me having to go back later when the answer doesnt match", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets organize terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lowest order i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at order of <expression> i have still just this one term <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we knew that was the correct result at order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at order of <expression> i have two terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is the product of these two terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> disappear <expression> and this will give me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and from other part i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i havent calculate things at order of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "fine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have calculated in a power series that we can go to whatever order you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> which is related to chemical potential as a function of this degeneracy that is simply related to density", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the formula for the pressure is up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so reorganizing this a little bit the dimensionless form is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> we can make an expansion", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression> and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "for <expression> i substitute from the line above", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the first term", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to square what is up here and here keeping terms to order of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so what do i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> from squaring this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a term that is twice the product of these two terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the only term that is order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally <expression> would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i havent calculated anything at all of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can see that everything is going to be proportional to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets put out the factor of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so this is just one factor of <expression> that i have pulled out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that then i start with <expression> and then the next correction i have an <expression> here <expression> here with opposite sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is twice bigger than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the sum total of them would be <expression> one factor of <expression> i have out front the other factor i will write here and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 115, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"text": "and then at order of <expression> i have a bunch of terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a <expression> here and from the product of these terms i will have <expression> disappear i have <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the product of these things will give me a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> i will get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have <expression> and this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is three times larger than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "subtract one of them i will be left <expression> ", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "<expression> ", "entities": []}
{"text": " <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see that the form that we have is <expression> the pressure starts with density", "entities": []}
{"text": "i essentially divide it through by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "i start with the ideal gas result <expression> and then i have a correction that is order of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "in view up our inaudible coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we see that our <expression> is <expression> times sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember that <expression> et cetera had dimensions of volume", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if the volume is provided by <expression> it is an additional factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "for fermions its a positive pressure", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the pressure goes up because fermions repel each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "for bosons it is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "bosons attract each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "the task for today is to find particular solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me remind you where weve gotten to", "entities": []}
{"text": "were talking about the secondorder equation with constant coefficients which you can think of as modeling springs or simple electrical circuits", "entities": []}
{"text": "but whats different now is that the righthand side is an input which is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we are considering im going to use <expression> as your book does keeping to a neutral letter", "entities": []}
{"text": "but again in the applications and in many of the applications at any rate it wants to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i make it <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so the independent variable is <expression> and the problem is remember that to find a particular solution and the reason why we want to do that is then the general solution will be of the form <expression>  that particular solution plus the complementary solution the general solution to the reduced equation which we can write this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all the work depends upon finding out what that <expression> is and thats what were going to talk about today or rather talk about for two weeks", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the point is not all functions that you could write on the righthand side are equally interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres one kind which is far more interesting but more important in the applications than all the others", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the one out of which in fact as you will see later on this week and into next week an arbitrary function can be built out of these simple functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the important function is on the righthand side to be able to solve it when its a simple exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you allow me to make it a complex exponential so here are the important righthand sides where we want we want to be able to do it when its of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in general that will be in most applications a is not a growing exponential but a decaying exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so typically <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it doesnt have to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill put it in parentheses though often", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "thats not any assumption that im going to make today", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just culture", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we want to be able to do it for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words when the righthand side is a pure oscillation thats another important type of input both for electrical circuits think alternating current or the spring systems", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a pure vibration is youre imposing pure vibration on the springmassdashpot system and you want to see how it responds to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you could put them together and make these decaying oscillations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could also have something like e to the <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the point is all of these together are really just special cases of one general thing exponential if you allow the exponent not to be a real number but to be a complex number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theyre all special cases of e to the ill write it <expression> well why dont we write it <expression> right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "if <expression> is <expression> then ive got this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is <expression> i got this case separating into its real and imaginary parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if neither is <expression> i have this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i dont want to keep writing <expression> all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to write that simply as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and you understand that <expression> is a complex number now", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt look like a real number", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so the complex number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the equation we are solving is which one", "entities": []}
{"text": "this pretty purple equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we are trying to find a particular solution of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the special functions we are going to use are these well this one in particular <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be our input", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it turns out this is amazingly easy to do because its an exponential because i write it in exponential form", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "the idea is simply to use a rule which in fact you know already the rule of substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to write the equation in the form so there it is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to think of the lefthand side as the polynomial operator <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> are constants applied to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the way i write the thing", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and this part im going to think of in the form", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> a polynomial in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact its a simple quadratic polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "but most of what im going to say today would apply equally well if we were a higher order polynomial a polynomial of higher degree", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just to reinforce the idea ive given you one problem in your problem set when <expression> is a polynomial of higher degree", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should say the notes are written for general polynomials not just for quadratic ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "im simplifying it by leaving it today ill do whats in the notes but ill do it in the quadratic case to save a little time and because thats the one you will be most concerned with in the problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now there are just a couple of basic formulas that were going to use all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first is that if you apply <expression> to a complex exponential or a real one it doesnt matter the answer is you get just what you started with with <expression> substituted by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words put an alpha wherever you saw a <expression> in the polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is now just an ordinary complex number and multiply that by what you started with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a basic formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called in the notes the substitution rule because the heart of it is you substitute for the <expression> you substitute <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 113, "end_offset": 123}]}
{"text": "now this hardly requires proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets prove it just so you see to reinforce things and make things go a little more slowly to make sure you are on board all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "how would i prove that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well just calculate it out what in fact is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its <expression> by linearity plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "well what are these", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats a second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you remember from the exam you can do tenth derivatives now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the second derivative is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words this law what im saying really is that this law is obviously quote unquote true", "entities": []}
{"text": " okay im not even going to put it in quotes", "entities": []}
{"text": "its obviously true for the operator <expression> and the operator <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore its true for linear combinations of these as well by linearity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so therefore also true for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact so if you calculate it out what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> times the coefficient plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 42}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "so its in fact exactly this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now how are we going to use this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the idea is very simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember were trying to solve this i should have some consistent notation for these equations", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "purple i think will be the right thing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you are solving purple equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "the formulas which will solve them will be orange formulas and we will see what we need as we go along", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i would like to just formulate it this solution the particular solution now", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "im going to call it a theorem", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "its really too simple to be a theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand its too important not to be a theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets call it as i called it in the notes the exponential input theorem which says it all", "entities": []}
{"text": "theorem says its important", "entities": []}
{"text": "exponential input means its taking <expression> to be an exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "its an exponential input and the theorem tells you what the response is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for that equation im not going to recopy the equation for the purple equation adequately indicated this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now try to take notes", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the purple equation a solution is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "somewhere i neglected to say that <expression> all right so for the purple  <expression> how about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "that equation <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the exponential input", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solution is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats a very useful formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact haynes miller who also teaches this course in his notes calls of the most important theorem in the course", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i dont have to totally agree with him but its certainly important", "entities": []}
{"text": "its probably the most important theorem for these two weeks anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you will have others as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so thats a theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "the theorem is going green", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can tell what they are by their color code", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in other words what ive done is simply write down the solution for you write down the particular solution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "but lets verify it in general", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the proof would be what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i have to substitute it into the equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "so the equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to know when i substitute that expression in is it the case that when i plug it in that the righthand side i calculate it out apply <expression> to it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 120, "end_offset": 129}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 137, "end_offset": 142}]}
{"text": "is it the case that i get <expression> on the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "well all you have to do is do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the substitution rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "what about this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "this guy is a constant so it just gets dragged along because this operator is linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this applied to that is this then if i apply it to one half that i get one half the answer and so on", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "so the <expression> is a constant and just gets dragged along", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now they cancel each other and the answer is indeed <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats not much of a proof", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope that to at least half this class youre wondering yes but what if peter had not caught the wolf", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean what if", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if", "entities": []}
{"text": "im looking stern", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay we will take care of it in the simplest possible way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we will assume that <expression> is not <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "the case <expression> is <expression> is in fact an extremely important case one that makes the world go round one that contributes to all sorts of catastrophes and they occur first here in the solution of differential equations and thats what controls all the catastrophes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a good side to it too", "entities": []}
{"text": "it also makes a lot of good things happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are no moral judgments in mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the time being lets assume <expression> is not <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and that proof is okay because the <expression> being in the denominator its okay to be in the denominator if youre not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets work in a simple example", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im picking the most complicated example i can think of", "entities": []}
{"text": "simple examples ill leave for your practice and for the recitations can start off with simple examples if you are confused by this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets solve an equation find a particular solution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "gulp", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so the input is this function <expression> its a decaying oscillation", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre seeing those already on the computer screen if you started your homework if youve done problem one on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a decaying exponential and i want to find a particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets find a particular and the general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the main part of the work is finding the particular solution but lets quickly the general solution lets find first the complementary part of it in other words the solution to the homogeneous equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no lets not", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to solve messy quadratics", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "okay were going to find a particular solution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "i thought it was going to come out easy and then i realized it wasnt because i picked the wrong signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so if you dont like just change the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can do that but you cannot", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont forget that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want a particular solution in our equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is this  that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets complexify it to make this part of a complex exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the complex exponential thats relevant is <expression> you see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the imaginary part of this complex exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is imaginary part of that guy <expression> and the imaginary part of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> of course just comes along for the ride", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay well now since this is a complex equation i shouldnt call this <expression> anymore by my notation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "i like to call it <expression> to indicate that the solution we get to this is not going to be the original solution to the original problem but you will have to take the imaginary part of it to get it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so we are looking now for the complex solution to this complexified equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the complex particular solution i can write down immediately", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is <expression> that of course just gets dragged along by linearity times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 76}]}
{"text": "and its over this polynomial evaluated at this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just write it down with have faith", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so what do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "square that because im substituting this <expression> into that polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason im doing that is because the formula tells me to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be that solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all ive done is substitute <expression> for <expression> in that polynomial the quadratic polynomial", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and now all i want is the imaginary part of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the imaginary part of this will be the solution to the original problem because this was the right hand side with the imaginary part of the complexified right hand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay now lets make it look a little better <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "clearly what we have to do something nice to the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill copy the numerator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "thats <expression> and how about the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "well again dont expand things out because its already this long", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the point of making it this long", "entities": []}
{"text": "you want to make it as long right", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay then there is room here for one real number and another real number times <expression> theres no more room", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay whats the real number", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay were looking for the real part of this expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just put it in and keep it mentally", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> thats <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can forget about that term", "entities": []}
{"text": "the term gives me <expression> for the real part plus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "the answer is that the real part is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about the imaginary part", "entities": []}
{"text": "well from here theres <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im expanding that out by the binomial theorem or whatever you like to call that <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "is that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it is <expression> and now in the denominator i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill put that in the numerator make it <expression> but i have to divide by the product of <expression> and its complex conjugate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 74}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "in other words im multiplying both top and bottom by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that makes here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now whats left is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now of that what we want is just the imaginary part", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> goes into <expression> makes <expression> so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were practically at our solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "the solution then finally is going to be <expression> is the imaginary part of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the coefficient out front first of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> so lets pull out to <expression> before we forget it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "and well pull out the <expression> before we forget that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and then the rest is simply a question of seeing whats left", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want the imaginary part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the imaginary part is going to be <expression> and then the other imaginary part comes from these <expression> pieces which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that should be the particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice that most of the work is not getting this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its turning it into something human that you can take the real and imaginary parts of", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we dont like this form you can put it in the other form which many engineers would do almost automatically make it <expression> and what will that be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can use the general formula if you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember <expression> the <expression> coefficients are <expression> and <expression> so its <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it is times this part makes <expression> over the angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay all right now lets address the case which is going to occupy a lot of the rest of today and in a certain sense all of next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens when <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in order to be able to handle this decently its necessary to have one more formula which is very slightly more complicated than the substitution rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its the same kind of rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to call this or it is called the exponential", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so im going to first prove a formula which is the analog of that and then i will prove a green formula which is what to do here if <expression> turns out to be <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 86}]}
{"text": "but in order to be able to prove that were going to be the analog of the orange formula", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "and the analogue of the orange formula that tells you how to apply <expression> to a simple exponential", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 66}]}
{"text": "i need a formula which applies <expression> to that simple exponential times another function", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i found i got into trouble by continuing to call that <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "so im now going to change the name of <expression> to change <expression> name to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "but its still complex", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont mean its guaranteed to be complex", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its allowed to be complex", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a is now allowed to be a complex number", "entities": []}
{"text": "im thinking of it in general as a complex number okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "i hope this doesnt upset you too much but you know you change <expression> to <expression> and <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "this is no worse", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right what we going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im going to use this exponential shift rule ill call it exponential shift rule or formula or law", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 48}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 53, "end_offset": 57}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "thats the substitution rule for me", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so this is going to be exponential shift law", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "and to apply it tells you how to apply the polynomial to not <expression> not just the exponential but the exponential times some function of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "whats that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the rule is very simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you can understand the difficulty", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you try to start differentiating youre going to have to calculate second derivatives of the stuff and god forbid higher order equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "you would have to calculate fourth derivatives fifth derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "you barely even want to calculate the first derivative", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "thats okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "but second derivative do i have to", "entities": []}
{"text": "no not if you know the exponential shift rule which says you can get rid of the <expression> make it pass to the left of the operator where its not in any position to do any harm any longer or upset the differentiation", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "and all you have to do is when it passes over that operator it changes <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "there its passed over", "entities": []}
{"text": "but when it did so it changed <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what about the u", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the u just stayed there", "entities": []}
{"text": "nothing happened to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay theres our orange formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess we better put the thing around the whole business", "entities": []}
{"text": "should i prove that or the proof is quite easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it just again to give you a chance to try to see now if somebody gives you a formula like that you first stare at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might try a couple of special cases try it on a function and see if it works but already you probably dont want to do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean even if you took a function like <expression> here youd have to do a certain amount of differentiating and some quadratic thing here", "entities": []}
{"text": "youd calculate and calculate away for a little while and then if you did it correctly the two would in fact turn out to be ", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "but you would not necessarily feel any the wiser", "entities": []}
{"text": "a better procedure in trying to understand something like this is say well lets keep the u general", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose we make <expression> simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example well if <expression> is a constant of course theres nothing to happen because if this is just a constant both sides of these are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "this doesnt make any sense if <expression> doesnt really have a <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well whats the simplest polynomial which would have a <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a special case", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "<equation> and check the formula in that case see if it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the formula is asking us what is <expression> thats the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not going to put in the variable here because its just a waste of chalk", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know how to calculate that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "ill use the product rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so its the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you what lets do the other order first", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "do you follow that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the product rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "its <expression> which is this thing times <expression> the other factor", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "now is that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to make it look like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well to make it look like that i should first factor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now whats left", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i factor <expression> whats left is <expression> which is exactly <expression> operating on <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "well hey thats just what the formula said it should be", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you make <expression> pass over <expression> it changes <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay now heres the main thing i want to show you", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right now well lets try if this is true also works out for <expression> then the formula is clearly true by linearity because an arbitrary <expression> is just a linear combination with constant coefficients of <expression> <expression> and that constant thing which we agreed there was nothing to prove about", "entities": []}
{"text": "now hack youre a hack if you take <expression> and start calculating the second derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay its question about hacks", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean its just you havent learned the right thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay that will work but its not what you want to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "instead you bootstrap your way up", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have already a formula telling me how to handle this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can be anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "look at this not as <expression> all by itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "calculate instead <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "think of that as <expression> the derivative of the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words we will do it one step at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you see now immediately the advantage of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i just calculated that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now dont go back to the beginning", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont go back to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "use the formula", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "after all you worked to calculate it or i did", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so its <expression> of and whats this inside", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that looks like a mess but it isnt because im taking <expression> times something", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i already know how to take <expression> times something", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "it doesnt matter what that something is", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the something was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the something is <expression> operating on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the principle is the same and the answer is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well to take <expression> times something you pass the <expression> over the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "that changes <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you apply that to the other guy which is <expression> applied to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "whats the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just what you would have gotten if you had taken <expression> to the <expression> pass it over and then changed <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now another advantage to doing it this way is you can see that this argument is going to generalize to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words you would continue on in the same way by the process of mathematical one word mathematical begins with an i induction", "entities": []}
{"text": "by induction you would prove the same formula for the nth derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you dont know what mathematical induction is shame on you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "a lot of you will be able to go through life without ever having to learn what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the rest of you will be computer scientists", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so thats the idea of this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can use it to calculate something", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see im going to need green for this i guess for our better formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "the formula now that tells you what to do if <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were trying to solve the equation <expression> we are trying to find a particular solution <expression> lets say", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "remember <expression> is complex", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> could be complex", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt have to be real", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the problem is that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do i get a particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i will write it down for you", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so this is part of that exponential input theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats the way it is in the notes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i gave all the cases together but i thought pedagogically its probably a little better to do the simplest case first and then build up on the complexity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is <expression> is <expression> except now you have to multiply it by <expression> out front", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "where have you done something like that before", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes dont tell me", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know you know", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what should go in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "clearly not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what goes in the denominator is the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay but what if <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "couldnt that happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes it could happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we better make cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "this case is the case where this is okay corresponds to the case where were going to assume that alpha is a simple root is a simple root of the polynomial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know what to call the variable <expression> is okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "a simple <expression> in other words its not double", "entities": []}
{"text": "well suppose is double", "entities": []}
{"text": "one of the consequences you will see just in a second if its a simple <expression> that means this derivative is not going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats automatic", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah well suppose its not as simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "well suppose is a double root", "entities": []}
{"text": "how did a how did that get changed to argh laughter thats not an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh well yes it is obviously", "entities": []}
{"text": "change all of you i want you to change", "entities": []}
{"text": "they should have something like in a search key where <expression> occurrences of alpha have been changed to a with a stroke of a just your thumb", "entities": []}
{"text": "they dont have that for the blackboard unfortunately", "entities": []}
{"text": "well too bad for the future", "entities": []}
{"text": "correctable blackboards", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what if a is double root", "entities": []}
{"text": "it cant be more than a double root because youve only got a quadratic polynomial", "entities": []}
{"text": "quadratic polynomials only have two roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the worst that can happen is that both of them are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right in that case the formula should be <expression>  you are now going to need <expression> up there times <expression> and in the denominator what you are going to need is the second derivative of evaluated at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 107, "end_offset": 112}]}
{"text": "now you can guess the way this going to go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "for higher degree things if youve got a triple root you will need here <expression> except youre going to need a factorial there too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dont worry about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its in the notes but im not going to give you that for higher roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont even know if i will give it to you for double root", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes i already did so its too late", "entities": []}
{"text": "its too late", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so we will make this two formulas according to whether a is a single or a double root", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets prove one of these and all of that will be good enough for my conscience", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets prove the first one", "entities": []}
{"text": "mostly its an exercise in using the first exponential shift rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay this will be a first example actually seeing a work in practice as opposed to proving it", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so what does that thing look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does the polynomial look like which has a as a simple root", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to try to prove the simple root case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just going to calculate what those guys actually look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does <expression> look like if a is a simple root", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if its a simple root that means it has a factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "when it factors it factors into the product of <expression> times something which isnt <expression> minus some other root", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 100, "end_offset": 105}]}
{"text": "and the point is that <expression> is not  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the roots are really distinct", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay whats then <expression> im going to have to calculate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets calculate <expression> first", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "it is well by the ordinary product rule its the derivative of this times which is <expression> plus thats one thing plus the same thing on the other side the derivative of this which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 99}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 120}]}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and therefore whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its nothing but this part is <expression> and thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course this is not <expression> because its a simple root", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the proof for you if you want that if the root is simple that p prime of a is guaranteed not to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see its going to be <expression> exactly when <equation> and that root occurs twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im assuming that didnt happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay then all the rest we have to do is calculate do the calculation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i want to prove now is that with this <expression> what im trying to calculate that <expression> times that guy <expression> except im going to write it as <expression> guess why divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 86}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 105, "end_offset": 110}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 152, "end_offset": 157}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 187, "end_offset": 197}]}
{"text": "this is my proposed particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i have to do is calculate it and see that it turns out to be what do i hope it turns out to be", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "what the right hand side of the equation the input", "entities": []}
{"text": "the input is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is true then <expression> a particular solution indeed nothing will be a particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course there could be others but in this game i only have to find one particular solution and that certainly by far is the simple as one you could possibly find", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to calculate this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and now you see why i did the exponential shift rule because this is begging to be differentiated by something simpler than hack", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay you can also see why i violated the natural order of things and put the e to the ax on the left in order that it pass over more easily", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer on the lefthand side is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "write it in this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is change <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so the first factor is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the second factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "change <expression> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "it turns into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all this is the result of taking that <expression> and changing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is to be applied to what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is already passed over", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats left is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats to be divided by the constant <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "now what does this all come out to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> whats <expression> applied to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "one right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now whats this thing applied to the constant one", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the <expression> kills it so it has no effect", "entities": []}
{"text": "it makes it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rest just multiplies it by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer to the top is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer to the bottom is <expression> which i showed you by just explicit calculation is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the answer is <expression> comes out right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the other one the other formula comes out the same way", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill leave that as an exercise", "entities": []}
{"text": "also i dont dare do it because its much too close to the problem i asked you to do for homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets by way of conclusion ill do one more simple example okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you can feel you understand something", "entities": []}
{"text": "im sort of bothered that i havent done any examples of this more complicated case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill pick an easy version instead of the one that you have in your notes which is the one you have for homework which is even easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this ones epsilon less easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay notice that one is a simple root", "entities": []}
{"text": "the one im talking about is the a here which is one", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is a simple root of the polynomial <expression> isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "put <equation> and you get <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "its a simple root because anybody can see that one is not a double root because you know from critical damping if one were a double root you know just what the polynomial would look like and it wouldnt look like that at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would not look like <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would look differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "therefore that proves that <expression> is a simple root", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay whats the particular solution therefore", "entities": []}
{"text": "the particular solution is <expression> divided by the derivative the derivative evaluated at the point so whats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "it is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i evaluate it at the point <expression> it is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so if this is to be divided by <expression> in other words its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and if you dont believe it you could plug it in and check it out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "okay im letting you out one minute early", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember that", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to pay off the accumulated debt", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor all right so lets begin lecture six", "entities": []}
{"text": "were talking today about exponentials and logarithms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these are the last functions that i need to introduce the last standard functions that we need to connect with calculus that youve learned about", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre certainly as fundamental if not more so than trigonometric functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all well start out with a number <expression> which is positive which is usually called a base", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have these properties that <expression> is always <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how we get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course <expression> not surprisingly is <expression> etc", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the general rule is that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the basic rule of exponents and with these two initial properties that defines the exponential function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres an additional property which is deduced from these which is the composition of exponential functions which is that you take <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 139}]}
{"text": "then that turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats an additional property that well take for granted which you learned in high school", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in order to understand what all the values of <expression> are we need to first remember that if youre taking a rational power that its the ratio of <expression> integers power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be <expression> and then were going to have to take the nth root of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when youre defining <expression> so <expression> is defined for all <expression> by filling in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna use that expression in quotation marks filling in by continuity", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is really what your calculator does when it gives you <expression> because you cant even punch in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt really exist on your calculator", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres some decimal expansion", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it takes the decimal expansion to a certain length and spits out a number which is pretty close to the correct answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "but indeed in theory there is an <expression> even though the <expression> is irrational", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres <expression> and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats the exponential function and lets draw a picture of one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well try say <equation> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im not going to draw such a careful graph but lets just plot the most important point which is the point 0 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then maybe well go back up here to <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is this point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is 1 12 the reciprocal", "entities": []}
{"text": "and over here we have <expression> and so that goes all the way up to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then exponentials are remarkably fast", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its off the board what happens next out at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its already above my range here but the graph looks something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "now ive just visually at least graphically filled in all the rest of the points", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have to imagine all these rational numbers and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this point here would have been 1 2", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so forth", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats not too far along", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now whats our goal", "entities": []}
{"text": "well obviously we want to do calculus here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our goal here for now  and its gonna take a while", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to think about it pretty hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to calculate what this derivative is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "all right so well get started", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we get started is simply by plugging in the definition of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative is the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the only step that we can really perform here to make this is into something a little bit simpler is to use this very first rule that we have here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that the exponential of the sum is the product of the exponentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i want to use is just the property that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and if i do that i see that i can factor out a common factor in the numerator which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 60}]}
{"text": "so well write this as the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> times this ratio now <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "so far so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "were actually almost to some serious progress here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres one other important conceptual step which we need to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a relatively simple one", "entities": []}
{"text": "we actually did this before by the way", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did this with sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next thing i want to point out to you is that youre used to thinking of <expression> as being the variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed already we were discussing <expression> as being the variable and <expression> as being fixed", "entities": []}
{"text": "but for the purposes of this limit theres a different variable thats moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is fixed and <expression> is the thing thats moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that this factor here which is a common factor is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can just factor it out of the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt affect the limit at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "a constant times a limit is the same as whether we multiply before or after we take the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just going to factor that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my next step here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and then i have the limit <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what i have here so this is by definition the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here is <expression> and its  this expression here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want to stare at this expression and see what its telling us because its telling us as much as we can get so far without some so first lets just look at what this says", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what its saying is that the derivative of <expression> is <expression> times something that we dont yet know", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to call this something this mystery number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna make the label <expression>  the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of a to the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this mystery number <expression> has a geometric interpretation as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me describe that", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has a geometric interpretation and its a very very significant number", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets work out what that is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so first of all lets rewrite the expression in the box using the shorthand for this number", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "so if i just rewrite it it says <expression>  this factor which is <expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "so the derivative of the exponential is this mystery number times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "so weve almost solved the problem of finding the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just have to figure out this one number <expression> and we get the rest", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me point out two more things about this number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all if i plug in <equation> thats going to be <expression>  at <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "according to this formula thats <expression> which of course <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the derivative of this function at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is the slope of <equation> of the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "the graph of <expression> at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again over here if you looked at the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill draw the one tangent line in here which is this one here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this thing has slope what were calling <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i graph the function <equation> ill get a certain slope here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "if i graph it with a different base i might get another slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we got so far is the following phenomenon if we know this one number if we know the slope at this one place we will be able to figure out the formula for the slope everywhere else", "entities": []}
{"text": "now thats actually exactly the same thing that we did for sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "we knew the slope of the <expression> and the <expression> function at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the sine function had slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the cosine function had slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then from the sum formulas well thats exactly this kind of thing here from the sum formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "this sum formula in fact is easier than the ones for <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "from the sum formulas we worked out what the slope was everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were following the same procedure that we did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "but at this point were stuck", "entities": []}
{"text": "were stuck because that time using radians this very clever idea of radians in geometry we were able to actually figure out what the slope is", "entities": []}
{"text": "whereas here were not so sure what <expression> is for instance", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just dont know yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the basic question that we have to deal with right now is what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what were left with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the curious fact is that the clever thing to do is to beg the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to go through a very circular route here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is circuitous not circular", "entities": []}
{"text": "circular is a bad word in math", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that one thing depends on another and that depends on it and maybe both are wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "circuitous means were going to be taking a roundabout route", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to discover that even though we refuse to answer this question right now well succeed in answering it eventually", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how are we going to beg the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "what were going to say instead is were going to define a mystery base or number <expression> as the unique number so that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "thats the trick that were going to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont yet know what <expression> is but were just going to suppose that we have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to show you a bunch of consequences of this and also i have to persuade you that it actually does exist", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first let me explain what the first consequence is", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all if <expression> is <expression> then if you look at this formula over here and you write it down for e you have something which is a very usable formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so thats an incredibly important formula which is the fundamental one", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the only one you have to remember from what weve done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should have highlighted it in several colors here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a big deal", "entities": []}
{"text": "very happy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again let me just emphasize also that this is the one which at <equation> has slope <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the way we defined it alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you plug in <equation> here on the right hand side you got <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "slope <expression> at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats great", "entities": []}
{"text": "except of course since we dont know what <expression> is this is a little bit dicey", "entities": []}
{"text": "so next even before explaining what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact we wont get to what <expression> really is until the very end of this lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have to persuade you why <expression> exists", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to have some explanation for why we know there is such a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so first of all let me start with the one that we supposedly know which is the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well call it <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the first thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember that the property that it had was that <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was the derivative of this function the slope at <equation> of the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "of the tangent line that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what were going to consider is any kind of stretching", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to stretch this function by a factor <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "any number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what were going to consider is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you do that thats the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now if i use the second law of exponents that i have over there thats the same thing as <expression> which is the same thing as some base <expression> where <expression>  lets write that down over here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 180, "end_offset": 185}]}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whatever it is if i have a different base which is expressed in terms of <expression> of the form <expression> then that new function is described by this function <expression> the stretch", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens when you stretch a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same thing as shrinking the x axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> gets larger this corresponding point over here would be over here and so this corresponding point would be over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you shrink this picture and the slope here tilts up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so as we increase <expression> the slope gets steeper and steeper", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see that explicitly numerically here", "entities": []}
{"text": "explicitly numerically if i take the derivative here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative with respect to <expression> thats the chain rule right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the derivative with respect to <expression> which is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if we do it at <expression> were just getting <expression> which is <expression> times this <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "so how is it exactly that we cook up the right base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> when <equation> over this number", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words we can pick all possible slopes that we want", "entities": []}
{"text": "this just has the effect of multiplying the slope by a factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can shift the slope at <expression> however we want and were going to do it so that the slope exactly matches <expression> the one that we want", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "we still dont know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "we still dont know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but at least we know that its there somewhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student how do you know its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor how do i know", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> is <expression> then the formula for <expression> is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive decided what <expression> is so therefore theres a formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and furthermore by the chain rule theres a formula for the derivative", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "and its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again scaling does this", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way we did exactly the same thing with the <expression> and <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you think of the sine function here let me just remind you here what happens with the chain rule you get <expression> here", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 99}]}
{"text": "so the fact that we set things up beautifully with radians that this thing is but we could change the scale to anything such as degrees by the appropriate factor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then there would be this scale factor shift of the derivative formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course the one with radians is the easy one because the factor is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the one with degrees is horrible because the factor is some crazy number like <expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so theres something going on here which is exactly the same as that kind of rescaling", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far weve got only one formula which is a keeper here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have a preliminary formula that we still havent completely explained which has a little wavy line there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have to fit all these things together", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so now to fit them together i need to introduce the natural log", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the natural log is denoted this way <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe ill call it a new letter name well call it <equation> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "but if we were reversing things if we started out with a function <equation>  the property that it would have is that its the inverse function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it has the property that the <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this defines the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the logarithm has a bunch of properties and they come from the exponential properties in principle", "entities": []}
{"text": "you remember these", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im just going to remind you of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the main one that i just want to remind you of is that the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe a few more are worth reminding you of", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is that the logarithm of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a second is that the logarithm of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these correspond to the inverse relationships here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i plug in here <equation> and <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "if i plug in <equation> and <equation> i get the corresponding numbers here <equation> and <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "and maybe it would be worth it to plot the picture once to reinforce this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here ill put them on the same chart", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "if you have here <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "then the logarithm which ill maybe put in a different color", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this crosses at this allimportant point here 0 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to figure out what the inverse function is i have to take the flip across the diagonal <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this shape here going down like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the point 1 0", "entities": []}
{"text": "so 1 0 corresponds to this identity here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice so this is <expression> the graph of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice its only defined for <expression> positive which corresponds to the fact that <expression> is always positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words this white curve is only above this axis and the orange one is to the right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its only defined for <expression> positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh one other thing i should mention is the slope here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the slope there is also going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what were allowed to do relatively easily because we have the tools to do it is to compute the derivative of the logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to find the derivative of <expression> were going to use implicit differentiation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 59}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "this is how we find the derivative of any inverse function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember the way that works is if you know the derivative of the function you can find the derivative of the inverse function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the mechanism is the following you write down here <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "heres the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "were trying to find the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now we dont know how to differentiate this equation but if we exponentiate it so thats the same thing as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because lets just stick this in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now we can differentiate this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do the differentiation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <equation> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this by the chain rule is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "the product of these two factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this guy the one little guy that we actually know and can use thats this guy here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so finally <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we discovered is and now i get to put another green guy around here is that this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so alright now we have two companion formulas here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate of change of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the rate of change of <expression> is itself is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its time to return to the problem that we were having a little bit of trouble with which is somewhat not explicit which is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we want to now differentiate <expression> in general not just <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "so lets work that out and i want to explain it in a couple of ways so youre going to have to remember this because im going to erase it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what id like you to do is so now i want to teach you how to differentiate basically any exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now to differentiate any exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are two methods", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre practically the same method", "entities": []}
{"text": "they have the same amount of arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see both of them and theyre equally valuable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to just describe them", "entities": []}
{"text": "method one im going to illustrate on the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were interested in differentiating this thing exactly this problem that i still didnt solve yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the procedure", "entities": []}
{"text": "the procedure is to write so the method is to use base <expression> or convert to base ", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "so how do you convert to base <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "well you write <expression> as <expression> to some power", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so what power is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> to the power <expression> to the power <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve made our conversion now to base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the exponential of something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to carry out the differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is a step which causes great confusion when you first see it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you must get used to it because its easy not hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate of change of this with respect to <expression> is let me do it by analogy here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because say i had <expression> and i were differentiating it", "entities": []}
{"text": "the chain rule would say that this is just <expression> the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the ordinary chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and what were doing up here is exactly the same thing because <expression> as frightening as it looks with all three letters there is just a fixed number", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the constant just accelerates the rate of change by that factor which is what the chain rule is doing", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "same business here with ln a replacing <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is something youve got to get used to in time for the exam for instance because youre going to be doing a million of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "so do get used to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand this expression here was the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so another way of writing this and ill put this into a box but actually i never remember this particularly", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just rederive it every time is that the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to get rid of whats underneath it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is another formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the formula ive essentially finished here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice what is the magic number", "entities": []}
{"text": "the magic number is the natural log of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what it was", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt know what it was in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the natural log of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me emphasize to you again something about whats going on here which has to do with scale change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative with respect to <expression> these are the two most obvious bases that you might want to use is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so one of the things thats natural about the natural logarithm is that even if we insisted that we must use base <expression> or that we must use base <expression> wed still be stuck with natural logarithms", "entities": []}
{"text": "they come up naturally", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the ones which are independent of our human construct of base <expression> and base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the natural logarithm is the one that comes up without reference", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well be mentioning a few other ways in which its natural later", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i told you about this first method now i want to tell you about a second method here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the second is called logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how does this work", "entities": []}
{"text": "well sometimes youre having trouble differentiating a function and its easier to differentiate its logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "that may seem peculiar but actually well give several examples where this is clearly the case that the logarithm is easier to differentiate than the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it could be that this is an easier quantity to understand", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we want to relate it back to the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to write it a slightly different way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "lets write it in terms of primes here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "so the basic identity is the chain rule again and the derivative of the logarithm well maybe ill write it out this way first", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 102}]}
{"text": "so this would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the two factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the same thing so remember what the derivative of the logarithm is", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i have a <expression> and here i have a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to encode this on the next board here which is sort of the main formula you always need to remember which is that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the one to remember here", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor the question is how did i get this step here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression> is the rate of change of <expression> with respect <expression> times the rate of change of <expression> with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 128, "end_offset": 133}]}
{"text": "thats the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so now ive worked out this identity here and now lets show how it handles this case <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to get that one i would take <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and now lets just take a look at what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i claim that this is pretty easy to differentiate", "entities": []}
{"text": "again it may seem hard but its actually quite easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe somebody can hazard a guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same thing that i was talking about before which is if youve got <expression> and youre taking its derivative with respect to <expression> here thats just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the kind of thing you have", "entities": []}
{"text": "again dont be put off by this massive piece of junk here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again keep that in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "it comes up regularly in this kind of question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres our formula that the logarithmic derivative is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets just rewrite that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "thats the same thing as <expression> which is <equation> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is our differentiation formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> if i just multiply through by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what we wanted", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the way that logarithmic differentiation works", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same arithmetic as the previous method but we dont have to convert to base <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "were just keeping track of the exponents and doing differentiation on the exponents and multiplying through at the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so im going to do two trickier examples which illustrate logarithmic differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "again these could be done equally well by using base <expression> but i wont do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "method one and method two always both work", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a second example again this is a problem when you have moving exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this time were going to complicate matters by having both a moving exponent and a moving base", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a function <expression> which is well maybe ill call it <expression> since we already had a function <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "a really complicated looking function here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again you can handle this by converting to base <expression> method one", "entities": []}
{"text": "but well do the logarithmic differentiation version alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i take the logs of both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "and now i differentiate it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and now when i differentiate this here i have to use the product rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 52}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 69}]}
{"text": "this time instead of having <expression> a constant i have a variable here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have two factors", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <expression> when i differentiate with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "when i differentiate with respect to this factor here i get that <expression> times the derivative of that which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so heres my formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "almost finished", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to multiply these two things together", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "ill put it on the other side because i dont want to get it mixed up with <expression> the quantity", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "and now im almost done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have <equation> and thats just <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these two methods always work for moving exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next thing that id like to do is another fairly tricky example", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this one is not strictly speaking within calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "although were going to use the tools that we just described to carry it out in fact it will use some calculus in the very end", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im going to do is im going to evaluate the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "so now the reason why i want to discuss this is is it turns out to have a very interesting answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a problem that you can approach exactly by this method", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is that it has a moving exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "the exponent n here is changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if you want to keep track of that a good way to do that is to use logarithms", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "so in order to figure out this limit were going to take the log of it and figure out what the limit of the log is instead of the log of the limit", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "those will be the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to take the natural log of this quantity here and thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and now im going to rewrite this in a form which will make it more recognizable so what id like to do is im going to write <expression> or maybe i should say it this way <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 122}]}
{"text": "so if <expression> is going to infinity then this <expression> is going to be going to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is more familiar territory for us in this class anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets rewrite it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that is multiplied by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is the reciprocal of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i want to change this in a very very minor way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to subtract <expression> from it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so thats the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im going to do is im going to subtract <expression> from it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "thats just  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not a problem and ill put some parentheses around it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now youre supposed to recognize all of a sudden what pattern this fits into", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the thing which we need to calculate in order to calculate the derivative of the log function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "so this is in the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>  the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the base point is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats where were evaluating it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the base value", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the difference quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this by definition tends to the limit here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we know what the derivative of the log function is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of the log function is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this limit is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we got it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we got the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we just have to work backwards to figure out what this limit that weve got over here is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the log approached <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so sorry the log of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah lets write it this way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "its the same thing as well the thing that we know is the log of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the one that we just figured out", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now this thing is the exponential of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its really <expression> to this power here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this guy is the same as the limit of the log of the limit of the thing which is the same as log of the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "the limit of the log and the log of the limit are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so i take the logarithm then im going to take the exponential", "entities": []}
{"text": "that just undoes what i did before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this limit is just <expression> so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the limit that we want here  ", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that with this step weve actually closed the loop finally", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we have an honest numerical way to calculate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "the first", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are many such", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this one is a perfectly honest numerical way to calculate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "we had this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "we didnt know exactly what it was", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was this <expression> there was <expression> the logarithm and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have all that stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we really need to nail down what this number <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is telling us if you take for example <expression> thats going to be a very good perfectly decent anyway approximation to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "so this is a numerical approximation which is all we can ever do with just this kind of irrational number", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that closes the loop and we now have a coherent family of functions which are actually well defined and for which we have practical methods to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay see you next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor hi and welcome", "entities": []}
{"text": "today were going to do a problem about least squares approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "find the quadratic equation through the origin that is a best fit for these three points 1 1 2 5 and 1 2", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill give you a minute to work that out on your own", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can hit the pause button now and well be back in a minute to work the problem out together", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and were back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the first step in a problem like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first step is figuring out what our equation looks like the one that were going to find", "entities": []}
{"text": "so our equation is going to look like <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what were looking for", "entities": []}
{"text": "were looking for a quadratic equation through the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if it were just any quadratic equation then we would have a constant term but through the origin just means that the constant term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats the next step", "entities": []}
{"text": "next we need to set up a matrix equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need an <expression> a matrix <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and which matrix is that going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me start with the first coordinate of these three points", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to put them in the first column of this matrix <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then my second column is going to be the squares of these coordinates <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my <expression> thats just <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my <expression> this is going to be the second coordinates <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok why did i set this problem up like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well multiply <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first coordinate of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the same as plugging in this first point into the lefthand side of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly if i took the second point and plugged it in here i would just get <expression> which is just the same as the second coordinate in the multiplication <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and where did the <expression> come from", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> came from plugging in these points to the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> and <expression> are just the ycoordinates of these three points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it would be great if we could solve <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "but we cant solve <equation> because there isnt a quadratic equation through the origin that contains these three points", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "but we need to find the best approximation to that so thats the same as solving <expression>  the projection of <expression> onto the column space of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we only have a chance of solving <expression>  something if its in the column space of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and remember from our projections part of the class that this is the same as solving <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what were really going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "were really going to solve <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and now all we have to do is just a computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do this kind of quickly because you should be good at multiplying matrices by now", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh this i have the negative in the wrong place thank you", "entities": []}
{"text": "thanks for that correction", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have the negative backwards there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what do i get when i multiply these", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill let you check", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you multiply this out ill let you check that you get <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just some computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what were solving here is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we remember how to do this just by using elimination", "entities": []}
{"text": "we replace the second row by <expression> times the second row minus <expression> times the first row", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 62}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 87}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 101}]}
{"text": "again im going to do this quickly because you know this from other parts of the class", "entities": []}
{"text": "you similarly change the b vector and we backsolve to get <expression> is <expression> and <expression>  lets plug that in and see think youre going to get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 114}]}
{"text": "so whats our final equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "our final equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is our best fit quadratic equation through the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "now before i end let me do a couple things", "entities": []}
{"text": "first let me go back and review what the key steps were", "entities": []}
{"text": "whenever youre faced with such a best fit equation first you want to see what the general form of the equation is", "entities": []}
{"text": "next you want to write it in terms of matrices", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "write down your matrix <expression> and your vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "and lastly you set up your projection equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then all you have to do is just a computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it might also be worth noting that these three points certainly arent on this quadratic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "for instance if i plug in <expression> here i dont get 1 1 i get 1 3", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "but thats ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is as close as we can do", "entities": []}
{"text": "thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so again welcome back", "entities": []}
{"text": "and todays topic is a continuation of what we did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "we still have a little bit of work and thinking to do concerning polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to talk about polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and my first job today is to talk a little bit about area", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats something we didnt mention last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since were all back from thanksgiving we can certainly talk about it in terms of a pie", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the basic idea for area in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres our pie and heres a slice of the pie", "entities": []}
{"text": "the slice has a piece of arc length on it which im going to call <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "and the area of that shadedin slice im going to call <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "and lets suppose that the radius is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "little <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a pie of radius <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "now its pretty easy to figure out what the area that slice of pie is", "entities": []}
{"text": "the total area is of course <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to get this fraction <expression> all we have to do is take the percentage of the arc of the total circumference", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>  this is the fraction of area sorry fraction of the total circumference the total length around the rim", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we multiply that by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats giving us the total area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you work that out thats <expression>  the <expression> cancel and we have <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "so heres the basic formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what we need to do is to talk about a variable pie here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be a pie with a kind of a wavy crust", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is coming around like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the distance from the center is varying with the place where we are the angle where were shooting out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i want to subdivide that into little chunks here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the idea for adding up the area the total area of this piece thats swept out is to break it up into little slices whose areas are almost easy to calculate", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely what were going to do is to take and im going to label it this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take these little circular arcs which go so im going to extend past where this goes", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then im going to take each circular arc here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a circular arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then heres another circular arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres another circular arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just right on the nose in that case", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in these two cases so basically the picture that im trying to draw for you is this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have some sector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have some circular arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe it takes a little extra", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a little extra area im making an error in the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a little extra area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe to draw it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im a little short on this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets say on this one im right on the nose", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have the same arc as the curve of the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is a little bit like the step functions that we used in riemann sums", "entities": []}
{"text": "its practically the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "eventually this little band of stuff that were missing by if we take very very narrow little slices here is going to be negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "itll get closer and closer to the curve itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that area will tend to <expression> in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we dont have to worry about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the approximate relationship is sitting here", "entities": []}
{"text": "where this distance now is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this radius is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in the approximate case what we have is that <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is practically the same thing we had here", "entities": []}
{"text": "except that that <expression> is replacing the constant there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its approximately true because <expression> is varying", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the limit we have the exact formula for the differential", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the main formula for area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you like the total area then is going to be the integral from some starting place to some end place of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this is only useful in the situation that were in", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely so this is the other important formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is only useful when <expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when this is the way in which the region is presented to us", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats our main formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do what example", "entities": []}
{"text": "the example that im going to take is the one that we did at the end of last time or near the end of last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "which was this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember that was the same as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what we did last time", "entities": []}
{"text": "we connected this rectangular representation to that polar representation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the picture is of a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "where this is the point 2a 0", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets figure out what the area is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well first of all we have to figure out when we sweep out the area we have to realize that we only go from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats something we can get from the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can also get it directly from this formula if you realize that <expression> is positive in this range here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at the ends its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the thing encloses a region at these ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at the ends <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what cinches this up like a little sack if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area is now going to be the integral from <expression> to <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor how do i know from looking at the picture that im going from <expression> to <expression> is the question", "entities": []}
{"text": "i do it with my whole body", "entities": []}
{"text": "i say here i am pointing down", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i sweep up thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i get all the way up to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the way i do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats really the way i do it im being honest", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if youre a machine you cant actually look", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you dont have a body so you cant point your arms", "entities": []}
{"text": "then you would have to go by the formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youd have to actually use something like this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the fact that this is where the loop cinches up", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is where the radius comes into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need to know that in order to understand the range", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor so when were doing these should we just guess that its going to be a loop", "entities": []}
{"text": "im probably going to give you some clues as to whats going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its very hard to figure these things out", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes itll be bounded by one curve and another curve and ill say its the thing in between those two curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the kind of thing that i could do", "entities": []}
{"text": "here you really should know this one in advance", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is by far the most or this is one of the typical cases anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to give you a couple more examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont get too worked up over this", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will somehow be able to visualize it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "ill give you some examples to help you out with it later", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres my integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were faced with a trig integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "which we have to remember how to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the trig integral here so first let me factor out the constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> so its <expression> integral from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you have to remember what youre supposed to do at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so think if you havent done it yet this is practice you need to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "this trig integral is handled by a double angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "as it happens im going to be giving you these formulas on the review sheet", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see theyre written on the review sheet", "entities": []}
{"text": "at least in some form", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example theres a formula and this will be on the exam too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the correct formula to use here", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the substitution that you use for the <expression> in order to integrate it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "that serves as a little review of trig integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is quite easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "this integral now is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is it easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "well because its the antiderivative of a constant <expression> its antiderivative youre supposed to be able to write down", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 116}]}
{"text": "so the antiderivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the antiderivative of the <expression> is <expression> the sine when its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the signs go away because theyre both <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all told we get <expression> which is certainly what we would like it to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the area of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question so im not sure which question youre asking", "entities": []}
{"text": "i pivoted my arm around 0 0", "entities": []}
{"text": "this point this is the point were talking about 0 0 is a key point", "entities": []}
{"text": "its where i guess you could say i stuck my elbow there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason is that its the place where <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its more or less the center of the universe from the point of view of this problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the reference point and if you like when youre doing this its a little bit like a radar screen", "entities": []}
{"text": "everything is centered at the origin and youre taking rays coming out from it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and seeing where theyre going to go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example this is the <equation> ray this is the <equation> ray", "entities": []}
{"text": "this the <equation> ray", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed if my elbow is right at this center here im pointing in those various directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what i had in mind when i did that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can always get these formulas by the way from the original business <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its useful to have the geometric picture as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words if you were a machine youd have to rely on these formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "and plot things using these", "entities": []}
{"text": "always", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in terms of plotting i want to expand your brain a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we need just a little bit more practice with plotting", "entities": []}
{"text": "in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the first question that i want to ask you is what happens outside of this range of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words what happens if <expression> beyond <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "can somebody see whats happening to the formulas in that case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im looking at now lets go back to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "what im looking at is this formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but to use the elbow analogy here im swept around like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now im going to point this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to point out over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "my hand is up here in the northwest direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats going to happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "somebody want to tell me", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor it goes around itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats right", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens is that when <expression> crosses this vertical <equation> when it crosses over here it goes negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so although my theta is pointing me this way the thing is going to go backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres another clue", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is very important", "entities": []}
{"text": "how far backwards is it going", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you dont actually need to know anything but this equation here to understand that it has to be on the same circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when im pointing this way the things points backwards to this point over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens is it goes around once", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when i point out this way it sweeps around a second time", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just keeps on going around the same circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so over here its empty", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its pointing the other way and its sweeping around the same curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "a second time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you were foolish enough to integrate say from <expression> to <expression> or some wider range what would happen is you would just double the area", "entities": []}
{"text": "because you would have swept it out twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the mistake that youll make", "entities": []}
{"text": "sometimes youll count things as negative and positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "but because theres a square here its always a positive quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll always overcount if you go too far", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "again it sweeps out the same region", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because these two equations really are equivalent to each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just that this one sweeps it out twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this one doesnt say how its sweeping it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah another question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student doesnt this equation also work if you just go from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor does the integration work if you just go from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the answer is yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a very weird object though", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just show you what that is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you started from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill illustrate it on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first thing that you swept out between <expression> and <expression> is this part here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was swept out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then when youre going around this next quadrant here youre actually sweeping out this underside here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually youre getting it because youre getting half of it on one half and getting the other half on the other quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its actually giving you the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "that turns out to be ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little weird way to chop up a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its legal", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course thats an accident of this particular figure", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cant count on that happening", "entities": []}
{"text": "its much better to line it up exactly with what the figure does", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dont do that too often", "entities": []}
{"text": "you might run into troubles", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to give you a couple more examples of practice with these pictures", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe im going to get rid of this one up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres another favorite", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres another favorite", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this if you like is example 2", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess we had an example 1 up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were really not going to try to do any more area examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "the area examples are actually straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "its really just figuring out what the picture looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is examples of drawings", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one is one thats kind of fun to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "something like this is on your homework", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what happens here is the following", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens here is that at <equation> thats the first place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just plot a few places here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not going to plot very many", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> i get <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops i get <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> thats where i get <expression> i get <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then again at <expression> i get <expression> which is back at <expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its and the other thing to say is in between here its positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what it does is it starts out at <expression> and it goes out to the radius <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it comes back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it does something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes out and it comes back", "entities": []}
{"text": "now because of the symmetries of the sine function this is pretty much all you need to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does something similar in all of the quadrants", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in order to see what its doing its useful for you to watch me draw it", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the order is very important for understanding what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its similar to this weird business with the circle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so watch me draw this guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill draw it in red because it usually has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "it does this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it does this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it does this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it does that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its called a fourleaf rose", "entities": []}
{"text": "i drew it in pink because its kind of a rose here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it started out over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is step 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the range <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it did this part here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then it went <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i should draw these in white because theyre harder to read in red", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now look at what it did", "entities": []}
{"text": "it did not make a right angle turn", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was nice and smooth", "entities": []}
{"text": "it went around here and then it went down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "back here thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then over here thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "back up here thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then around here thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and down here thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then back where it started and goes around again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is because actually its switching sign when it crosses the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "when it was over in this quadrant the first time it actually was tracing whats directly behind it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is kind of amusing", "entities": []}
{"text": "from this little tiny formula you get this pretty diagram here", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway thats as i say an old favorite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here if you want to do the area of one leaf youve got to make sure you understand that its a small piece of the whole", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now i have one last drawing example that i want to discuss with you", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it involves another skill that we havent quite gotten enough practice with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to do that one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its also preparation for an exercise", "entities": []}
{"text": "but one that were going to do after the test", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres my last example", "entities": []}
{"text": "were going to discuss what happens with this function here", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry thats not legible is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the first thing i want to do is just take our time a little bit and plot a few points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the values of <expression> and here are the values of <expression> and well see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well try to figure out what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <equation> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the denominator is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if theta im going to make it easy were not going to do so many", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do <expression> thats an easy value of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that value of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to back up and do <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> again <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now id like to just plot those points anyway and see whats going on with this expression here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first one is a rectangular im going to write the rectangular coordinates here not the polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rectangular coordinates here are <expression> out at the horizontal so its 13 0", "entities": []}
{"text": "the polar coordinates is 13 0 but the rectangular coordinate is also that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and over here at <expression> the distance is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the point 0 1 in xy coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then down here at <expression> its 0 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just emphasize", "entities": []}
{"text": "you should be able to think of this visually if you can crank your arm around and think it", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if youre righthanded youll bend that way no", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "or youll have to use but this also works using this formulas <equation> <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice that in this case <expression> was <expression> but the <expression> was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lo and behold you get <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here you get <expression> here you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did it purely visually or sort of organically", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can also do it by plugging in the numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "now in between the denominator is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its something in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to sweep around something like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what happens in between", "entities": []}
{"text": "as <expression> increases from <expression> to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now something interesting happens with this particular function which is that we notice that the denominator is <expression> at a certain place", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if i solve <equation> then the denominator is going to be <expression> there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "thats <equation> so <expression>  it turns out plus or minus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the values here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when were out here somewhere in these directions theres nothing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going infinitely far out", "entities": []}
{"text": "those ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats about as much as well be able to figure out of this diagram without doing some analytic work", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the other little piece that i want to explain", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely going backwards from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is one thing that we havent done", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is the rectangular equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means the x y equation for this <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well first im going to clear the denominator here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to rewrite it as <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and the reason for that is that in a minute ill explain to you why", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this guy im going to square now", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "im going to make this <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and now with an <expression> i can plug in <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "so this is a standard thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its basically what youre going to do any time youre faced with an equation like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "is try to work it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in these situations where you have <expression> or <expression> youll always come out with some quadratic expression like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im going to combine terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i have <expression> and put everything on the the left side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we recognize well youre supposed to recognize that this is whats known as a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the signs are the same its an ellipse", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the the signs are opposite its a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in between if one of the coefficients on the quadratic is <expression> its a parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we see that the picture that we drew there is actually turns out its going to have asymptotes its going to be a hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now let me ask you the last little mindbending question that i want to ask", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is what happens so now im using my right arm i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "but my elbows at the origin here", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens if i pass outside to the range where this denominator is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it crossed <expression> and it went to negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "its sweeping out something over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it sweeping out the same curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "anybody have any idea what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor yeah exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "good answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the other branch of the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats actually happening is in disguise theres another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that is consistent with these algebraic equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "the algebraic equation that i got here doesnt say which branch of the hyperbola ive got", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually got two branches", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the curve really was in disguise capturing both of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is a really beautiful connection", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to make that connection in connection also with this example", "entities": []}
{"text": "the hyperbolas as you probably know are the trajectories of comets", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ellipses which is what you would get if maybe you put <expression> here instead of a <expression> would be the trajectories of planets or asteroids", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres actually something much more important physically that goes on", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats special about this particular representation of the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what happens when you get the ellipses as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that in this case <equation> is the focus of the hyperbola", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what that means is that its actually the place where the sun is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the right representation if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "and pretty much any other", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean you cant tell that at all from the algebraic equations here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely theres something called keplers law", "entities": []}
{"text": "which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rate of change of area relative to the center of mass relative to the sun", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in  areas this is amount of area", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this its speed varies", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its speed varies according to a very specific rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely this one here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this rule was observed by kepler", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you have this connection here we also have something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "we also know that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats this formula here formally dividing by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the rate of change with respect to this time parameter which is the honest to goodness time", "entities": []}
{"text": "real physical time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means this quantity here is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is one of the key insights that physicists had long after kepler made his physical observations they realized that he had managed to get the best physics experiment of all because its a frictionless setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "outer space theres no air", "entities": []}
{"text": "nothing is going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is whats known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the expression for angular momentum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what kepler was observing it turns out is what we see all the time in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "or if youre an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more you can spin faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres an exact quantitative rule that does that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its exactly this polar formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a neat thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats it for generalities and a little pep talk on whats coming up to you when you learn a little more physics", "entities": []}
{"text": "right now we need to talk about the exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all let me tell you what the topics are", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre the same as last years test", "entities": []}
{"text": "which you can take a look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "one of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are three which we will test", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is integration by parts", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one is partial fractions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats more than half of the exam right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other half of the exam is parametric curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are all interrelated", "entities": []}
{"text": "and area of surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are the only kind that we can handle", "entities": []}
{"text": "just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres a final topic which is polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and area in polar coordinates including area", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats on the test there are six problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre very similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theyre not actually that similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theyre somewhat similar to last years", "entities": []}
{"text": "id say the test is similar", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe a tiny bit more difficult", "entities": []}
{"text": "well see", "entities": []}
{"text": "well see", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question was we didnt do arc length in polar coordinates did we", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is no we did not", "entities": []}
{"text": "we did not do arc length in polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i give you an exercise im going to ask you about if you know the speed of a comet here whats the speed of the comet there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well have to know about arc length for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were not doing it on this exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question is will i expect you to know <expression>  so lets see if i can formulate this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "its related to this fourleaf rose here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is suppose i gave you something that looked like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "would i expect you to be able to know what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think the answer the fair answer to give you is if its this complicated i only have two possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can give you a long time to sketch this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "and think about what it does", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i can tell you that it happens to be a threeleaf rose", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you have some clue as to what its doing", "entities": []}
{"text": "it doesnt have six", "entities": []}
{"text": "because of some weird thing having to do with repetitions", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the odds and evens work differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact i would have to tell you what the picture looks like if its going to be this complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly so this is an important point to make when we come to techniques of integration any integral that you have im not going to tell you which of these three techniques to use on the ones which are straightforward integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if its an integral that i think youre going to get stuck on either im going to give you a hint tell you how to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "or im going to tell you dont do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i tell you dont do it dont try to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "it may be impossible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even if its possible its going to be very long", "entities": []}
{"text": "like an hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "so dont do it unless i tell you to", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the other hand all of these setups in this second half of this unit they involve somehow setting something up", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre basically three issues", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is what the integrand is", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is what the lower limit is what is the upper limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre just three things three inputs to setting up an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "all integrals this is going to be the setup for all of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the second step is evaluating", "entities": []}
{"text": "which really is what we did in the first half here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and unfortunately we dont have infinitely many techniques and indeed theres some integrals that cant be evaluated and some that are too long", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well just try to avoid those", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question is will the percentages be the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill tell you exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> points", "entities": []}
{"text": "unless i change the point values", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "this is <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what it came out to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "you are going to want to know about all of the things that ive written down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre definitely going to want to know for example surfaces of revolution", "entities": []}
{"text": "how to set those up", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "there was another question i saw", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor so if you have a partial fraction with something like <expression> and maybe an <expression> and maybe an <expression> and youre interested in what happens with this denominator here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats going to happen is youre going to need a coefficient for each degree of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so altogether the setup is going to be this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you need student inaudible professor so if i change this to being a <expression> here then i need i guess ill have to call it <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 121, "end_offset": 125}]}
{"text": "i need that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now it gets harder and harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "the more repeated roots there are the more repeated factors there are the harder it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the ones you can pick off by the coverup method are is just the top one here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these two", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression> and <expression> you can get", "entities": []}
{"text": "but <expression> and <expression> youre going to have to do by either plugging in or some other more elaborate algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the more of these lower terms there are the worse off you are", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor the question is does this <expression> affect this setup", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the answer is almost no", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is not at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same setup exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres one thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the degree gets too big then youve got to use long division first to knock it down", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 62}]}
{"text": "ill give you an example of this type of practice", "entities": []}
{"text": "unless there are more question", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor are you going to have to know how to do reduction formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "anything thats a little out of the ordinary like a reduction formula i will have to coach you to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words what youll have to be able to do in that situation is follow directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i tell you ok youre faced with this then do an integration by parts", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "and do that then get the reduction formula", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "student inaudible professor yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the question had do with the partial fractions method", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what happens if you have a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for instance if it were this this ones too disgusting", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to just do it with two of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the parts with <expression> and <expression> are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now you have linear factors here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> maybe ill call them <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "this is the way it works", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok im going to give you one more quick example of an integration technique just to liven things up", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a somewhat tricky example", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just a little trickier than i would give you on a test", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its the same principle and i may do this on a final exam", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose youre faced with this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "what are you going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "integration by parts great", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats right thats because this guy is begging to be differentiated to be made simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that i want this one to be <expression> and i want this one to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to use integration by parts", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and then <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is now <expression> minus the integral of this guy", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "which is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you are not done at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre still in slightly hot water", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre in tepid water anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it that you have to do here", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre faced with this integral which ill put on the next board", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a lot simpler than the other one but as i say youre not quite out of the woods", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre faced with the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor trig substitution actually interestingly will work", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that wasnt what i wanted you to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wanted you to yeah go ahead", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor add and subtract <expression> to the numerator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "so now thats the correct answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the case where the numerator and the denominator are tied", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you have to use long division", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "but a shortcut is just to observe that the result of long division is the same thing as doing this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then noticing that this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the same as long division in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "because when you divide in it goes in with a quotient of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and so this guy turns out to be <expression> the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is one extra step that you may be faced with someday in your life", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just keep that in mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison were starting a new unit today", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is unit 2 and its called applications of differentiation", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first application and were going to do two today is what are known as linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "whoops that should have two ps in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that can be summarized with one formula but its going to take us at least half an hour to explain how this formula is used", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> is approximately  to its value at a base point plus the derivative times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 68}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 83}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 89}]}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the main formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "for right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "put it in a box", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "and let me just describe what it means first", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then ill describe what it means again and several other times", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all what it means is that if you have a curve which is <equation> its approximately the same as its tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this other side is the equation of the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets give an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take the function <expression> which is <expression> and then its derivative is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "and so lets take the base point <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "thats pretty much the only place where we know the logarithm for sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what we plug in here now are the values", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or sorry <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> well thats <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we have an approximation formula which if i copy down whats right up here its going to be <expression> is approximately so <expression> is <expression> right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i plugged in here for <expression> <expression> places", "entities": []}
{"text": "i evaluated the coefficients and this is the dependent variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all told if you like what i have here is that the logarithm of <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me draw a picture of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the graph of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then ill draw in the tangent line at the place that were considering which is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ive separated a little bit but really i probably should have drawn it a little closer there to show you", "entities": []}
{"text": "the whole point is that these two are nearby", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theyre not nearby everywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the line <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right thats the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyre nearby only when <expression> is near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so say in this little realm here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> is approximately <expression> this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "once you get a little farther away this straight line this straight green line will separate from the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "but near this place theyre close together", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the idea again is that the curve the curved line is approximately the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is one example of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so i want to explain this in one more way", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we want to discuss it systematically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the second way that i want to describe this requires me to remind you what the definition of the derivative is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the definition of a derivative is that its the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> of <expression> thats one way of writing it all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the way we defined it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one of the things that we did in the first unit was we looked at this backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "we used the derivative knowing the derivatives of functions to evaluate some limits", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 77, "end_offset": 83}]}
{"text": "so you were supposed to do that on your", "entities": []}
{"text": "in our test there were some examples there at least one example where that was the easiest way to do the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in other words you can read this equation both ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is really of course the same equation written twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats new about what were going to do now is that were going to take this expression here <expression> and were going to say well when <expression> is fairly near <expression> this expression is going to be fairly close to the limiting value", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 72}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 88}]}
{"text": "so this is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that i claim is the same as whats in the box in pink that i have over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this approximation formula here is the same as this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an average rate of change and this is an infinitesimal rate of change", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyre nearly the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the claim", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youll have various exercises in which this approximation is the useful one to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will as i said ill be illustrating this a little bit today", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me just explain why those two formulas in the boxes are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just start over here and explain that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the smaller box is the same thing if i multiply through by <expression> as <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i just write out what this is its <expression> right <expression> im going to write it this way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 27}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 94}]}
{"text": "which is approximately <expression> and this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here im using the notations <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is the change in <expression> this is just rewriting what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the last step is just to put the constant on the other side", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is exactly what i had just to begin with right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these two are just algebraically the same statement", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one another way of looking at it", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so now i want to go through some systematic discussion here of several linear approximations which youre going to be wanting to memorize", "entities": []}
{"text": "and rather than its being hard to memorize these its supposed to remind you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that youll have a lot of extra reinforcement in remembering derivatives of all kinds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when we carry out these systematic discussions we want to make things absolutely as simple as possible", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so one of the things that we do is we always use the base point to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im always going to have <equation> in this standard list of formulas that im going to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i put <equation> then this formula becomes <expression> a little bit simpler to read", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "it becomes <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is probably the form that youll want to remember most", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats again just the linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but one always has to remember and this is a very important thing this one only worked near <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this approximation here really only works when <expression> is near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a little addition that you need to throw in", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one works when <expression> is near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you cant expect it to be true far away", "entities": []}
{"text": "the curve can go anywhere it wants when its far away from the point of tangency", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok so lets work this out", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do it for the sine function for the cosine function and for <expression> to begin with", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "when does this one work", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so the question was when does this one work", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is when <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its actually the same as this one over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed thats whats going on when we take this limiting value", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> going to <expression> is the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so another way of saying it is the <expression> is small", "entities": []}
{"text": "now exactly what we mean by small will also be explained", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it is a matter to some extent of intuition as to how much how good it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "in practical cases people will really care about how small it is before the approximation is useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats a serious issue", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so let me carry out these approximations for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is always for <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so all of these are going to be for <expression> near <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to make this computation i have to evaluate the function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "i need to plug in two numbers here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "in order to get this expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to know what <expression> is and i need to know what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is the function <expression> then im going to make a little table over to the right here with <expression> and then im going to evaluate <expression> and then im going to evaluate <expression> and then read off what the answers are", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 144}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 145, "end_offset": 157}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 179, "end_offset": 187}]}
{"text": "right so first of all if the function is <expression> the derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value of <expression> thats <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we have the coefficients <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this number is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this number is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we get here is <expression> so this is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the linear approximation to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly so now this is a routine matter to just read this off for this table", "entities": []}
{"text": "well do it for the cosine function", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate the cosine what you get is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value at <expression> is <expression> so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value of this <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going back over here <expression> so this is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this linear function happens to be constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally if i do need <expression> its derivative is again <expression> and its value at <expression> is <expression> the value of the derivative at <expression> is also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so both of the terms here <expression> and <expression> theyre both <expression> and we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can memorize these", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll probably remember them either this way or that way", "entities": []}
{"text": "this collection of information here encodes the same collection of information as we have over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the values of the function and the values of their derivatives at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just emphasize again the geometric point of view by drawing pictures of these results", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all for the sine function heres the sine  well close enough", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats  boy now that is quite some sine isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should try to make the two bumps be the same height roughly speaking", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway the tangent line were talking about is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and near <expression> those things coincide pretty closely", "entities": []}
{"text": "the cosine function ill put that underneath i guess", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think i can fit it", "entities": []}
{"text": "make it a little smaller here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for the cosine function were up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well no wonder the tangent line is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "its horizontal", "entities": []}
{"text": "the tangent line is horizontal so the function corresponding is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally if i draw <equation> thats coming down like this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and the tangent line is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value is <expression> and the slope is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is how to remember it graphically if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "this analytic picture is extremely important and will help you to deal with sines cosines and exponentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison the question is what do you normally use linear approximations for", "entities": []}
{"text": "good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "were getting there", "entities": []}
{"text": "first were getting a little library of them and ill give you a few examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now i need to finish the catalog with two more examples which are just a little bit slightly more challenging", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a little bit less obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next couple that were going to do are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok these are the last two that were going to write down", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "and that you need to think about", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the procedure is the same as over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i have to write down <expression> and i have to write down <expression> and i have to write down <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 93, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"text": "and then ill have the coefficients to be able to fill in what the approximation is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> in the case of the logarithm", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> if i plug in thats <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "and f if i plug in <expression> here i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and similarly if i do it for this one i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i plug in <expression> i get <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and here i get <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the corresponding statement here is that <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> and here we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now i do want to make a connection explain to you whats going on here and the connection with the first example", "entities": []}
{"text": "we already did the logarithm once", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets just point out that these two computations are the same or practically the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "here i use the base point <expression> but because of my sort of convenient form which will end up i claim being much more convenient for pretty much every purpose we want to do these things near <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "you cannot expand the logarithm and understand a tangent line for it at <equation> because it goes down to minus infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly if you try to graph <expression> <expression> without the <expression> here youll discover that sometimes the slope is infinite and so forth", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so this is a bad choice of point", "entities": []}
{"text": "1 is a much better choice of a place to expand around", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we shift things so that it looks like its <equation> by shifting by the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so the connection with the previous example is that the what we wrote before i could write as <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "right thats just recopying what i have over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "except with the letter <expression> rather than the letter <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and then that if i copy it down you see that i have a <expression> in place of <expression> thats the same as this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and if i write out <expression> if i subtract <expression> from <expression> that means that its <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "so thats whats on the righthand side there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are the same computation ive just changed the variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i want to try to address the question that was asked about how this is used", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what the importance is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im going to do is just give you one example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then try to emphasize", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first way in which this is a useful idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "so or maybe this is the second example", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well call this example 2 maybe", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just take the logarithm of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take the logarithm of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that according to our rules i can glance at this and i can immediately see that its approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what did i use here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i used that <expression> is approximately <expression> and the value of <expression> that i used was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that is the formula so i should put a box around these two formulas too", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this formula here applied with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im claiming that <expression> is a sufficiently small number sufficiently close to <expression> that this is an ok statement", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first question that i want to ask you is which do you think is a more complicated thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "the lefthand side or the righthand side", "entities": []}
{"text": "i claim that this is a more complicated thing youd have to go to a calculator to punch out and figure out what this thing is", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know what a tenth is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the distinction that i want to make is that this half this part this is hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "now that may look contradictory but i want to just do it right above as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "this looks uglier but actually this is the hard one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is giving us information about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me show you why thats true", "entities": []}
{"text": "look down this column here", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the hard ones hard functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the easy functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats easier than this", "entities": []}
{"text": "nothing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "well yeah <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "over here it gets even worse", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are the hard functions and these are the easy ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the main advantage of linear approximation is you get something much simpler to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if youve made a valid approximation you can make much progress on problems", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well be doing some more examples but i saw some more questions before i made that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison is this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or what", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison this is a parens there", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> its the digital number right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess ive never used that before a decimal point have i", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know", "entities": []}
{"text": "other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue here", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give you some more examples where it becomes even more vivid if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "that this approximation is giving us something a little simpler to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres example 3", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to ill find the linear approximation near <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "i also  when i write this expression near <equation> thats the same thing as this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "thats the same thing as saying <expression> is approximately <expression>  of the function <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what i claim i want to use for the purposes of this approximation are just the sum of the approximation formulas that weve already derived", "entities": []}
{"text": "and just to combine them algebraically", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "so im not going to do any calculus im just going to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "so with <expression> its pretty clear that i should be using this formula for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the other one it may be slightly less obvious but we have powers of <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets plug those in", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "ill put this up so that you can remember it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "and were going to carry out this approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all im going to write this so that its slightly more suggestive", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "namely im going to write it as a product", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and there you can now see the exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this case <equation> eh <expression> that were going to use", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i have <expression> and thats going to be approximately well im going to use this formula", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 83}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "i have to use it correctly", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "x is replaced by <expression> so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then over here i can just copy verbatim the other approximation formula with <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "so this is times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to carry out the multiplication", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now heres our formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now this isnt where things stop", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed in this kind of arithmetic that im describing now things are easier than they are in ordinary algebra in arithmetic", "entities": []}
{"text": "the reason is that theres another step which im now going to perform", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is that im going to throw away this term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to ignore it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "in fact i didnt even have to work it out", "entities": []}
{"text": "because im going to throw it away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the reason is that already when i passed from this expression to this one that is from this type of thing to this thing i was already throwing away quadratic and higherordered terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this isnt the only quadratic term", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are tons of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to ignore all of them if im going to ignore some of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact i only want to be left with the linear stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "because thats all im really getting a valid computation for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is approximately <expression> minus so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a total of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the linear part", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> term is negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we drop <expression> term", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "terms and higher", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of those terms should be lowerorder", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you imagine <expression> is <expression> or maybe <expression> then these terms will end up being much smaller", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a rather crude approach", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats really the simplicity and thats the savings", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now since this unit is called applications and these are indeed applications to math i also wanted to give you a reallife application", "entities": []}
{"text": "or a place where linear approximations come up in real life", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe well call this example 4", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is supposedly a reallife example", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill try to persuade you that it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i like this example because its got a lot of math as well as physics in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i am on the surface of the earth", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here is a satellite going this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "at some velocity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this satellite has a clock on it because this is a gps satellite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it has a time <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have a watch in fact its right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have a time which i keep", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression> and theres an interesting relationship between <expression> and <expression> which is called time dilation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is from special relativity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its the following formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> where <expression> is the velocity of the satellite and <expression> is the speed of light", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now id like to get a rough idea of how different my watch is from the clock on the satellite", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to use this same approximation weve already used it once", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to write <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "but now let me just remind you", "entities": []}
{"text": "the situation here is we have something of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats whats happening when i multiply through here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in real life of course the expression that youre going to use the linear approximation on isnt necessarily itself linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "it can be any physical quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately  well again its the same rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres an <expression> and then <expression> is <expression> so this is <expression> so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is approximately by the same rule this is <expression> <expression> is approximately <expression> now i promised you that this would be a reallife problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is when people were designing these gps systems they run clocks in the satellites", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre down there youre making your measurements youre talking to the satellite by or youre receiving its signals from its radio", "entities": []}
{"text": "the question is is this going to cause problems in the transmission", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in this case what actually happened is that <expression> is about <expression> kilometers per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how fast the gps satellites actually go", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they couldve tweaked this if they had put them at different places", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway the speed of light is <expression> kilometers per second", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this number <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if you actually keep track of how much of an error that would make in a gps location what you would find is maybe its a millimeter or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats nice", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in fact the engineers who were designing these systems actually did use this very computation", "entities": []}
{"text": "exactly this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way that they used it was they decided that because the clocks were different when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency that frequency would be shifted", "entities": []}
{"text": "would be offset", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of exactly this offset", "entities": []}
{"text": "to compensate for the way the signal is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so from the point of view of good reception on your little gps device they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites according to exactly this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and incidentally the reason why they didnt they ignored higherorder terms the sort of quadratic terms is that if you take <expression> thats a size <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "and that really is totally negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "that doesnt matter to any measurement at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats on the order of nanometers and its not important for any of the uses to which gps is put", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats a real example of a use of linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take a little pause here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to switch gears and talk about quadratic approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "but before i do that lets have some more questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison ok so the question was asked suppose i did this by different method", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose i applied the original formula here", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely i define the function <expression> which was this function here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and then i plugged in its value at <equation> and the value of its derivative at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the answer is yes its also true that if i call this function <expression> then it must be true that the linear approximation is <expression> of  im sorry its at <expression> so its <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that should be true", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula that were using", "entities": []}
{"text": "its up there in the pink also", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i plug in <expression> here i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "so this thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats no surprise", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what i got", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i computed <expression> by the product rule it would be an annoying somewhat long computation", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "and because of what we just done we know what it has to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because this is a shortcut for doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is faster than doing that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course thats a legal way of doing it", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you get to second derivatives youll quickly discover that this method that ive just described is complicated but far superior to differentiating this expression twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible prof", "entities": []}
{"text": "jerison would you have to throw away an <expression> term if you differentiated", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact we didnt really have to do that here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you differentiate and then plug in <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "so if you differentiate this and you plug in <equation> you get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "you differentiate this and you plug in <equation> this term still drops out because its just a <expression> when you differentiate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 130}]}
{"text": "and then you plug in <equation> its gone too", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and similarly if youre up here it goes away and similarly over here it goes away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the higherorder terms never influence this computation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this just captures the linear features of the function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i want to go on to quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now were going to elaborate on this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that should have been linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "liner", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so that was wrong", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now were going to change it to quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so suppose we talk about a quadratic approximation here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the quadratic approximation is going to be just an elaboration one more step of detail", "entities": []}
{"text": "from the linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words its an extension of the linear approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so were adding one more term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the extra term turns out to be related to the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a factor of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the formula for the quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this chunk of it of course is the linear part", "entities": []}
{"text": "this time ill spell linear correctly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the linear part is the first piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the quadratic part is the second piece", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to develop this same catalog of functions as i had before", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words i want to extend our formulas to the higherorder terms", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "and if you do that for this example here maybe ill even illustrate with this example before i go on if you do it with this example here just to give you a flavor for what goes on what turns out to be the case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the linear version", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now im going to compare it to the quadratic version", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so the quadratic version turns out to be this", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what turns out to be the quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i use this example here so this is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "<expression> which is the same as <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that turns out instead of being <expression> thats point what is it ", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little bit less", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> but its pretty close", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you like the correction is lower in the decimal expansion", "entities": []}
{"text": "now let me actually check a few of these", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill carry them out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "and what im going to probably save for next time is explaining to you so this is why this factor of <expression> and were going to do this later", "entities": []}
{"text": "do this next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can certainly do well to stick with this presentation for one more lecture", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can see this reinforced", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im going to work out these derivatives of the higherorder terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and let me do it for the <expression> approximately <expression> case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all i want to add in the extra term here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "heres the extra term", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the quadratic part", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now in order to figure out whats going on im going to need to compute also second derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 73}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 79, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "so here i need a second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i need to throw in the value of that second derivative at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "so this is what im going to need to compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i do it for example for the sine function i already have the linear part", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need this last bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i differentiate the sine function twice and i get i claim minus the sine function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "the first derivative is the cosine and the cosine derivative is minus the sine", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i evaluate it at <expression> i get lo and behold <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually the quadratic approximation is the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres no <expression> term here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why this is such a terrific approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also the quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the cosine function if you differentiate twice you get the derivative is minus the sign and derivative of that is minus the cosine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i evaluate that at <expression> i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and so the term that i have to plug in here this <expression> is the coefficient that appears right here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i need a <expression> extra", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you do it for the <expression> you get an <expression> and you got a <expression> and so you get <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to finish these two in just a second but i first want to tell you about the geometric significance of this quadratic term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "geometric significance of the quadratic term", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the geometric significance is best to describe just by drawing a picture here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to draw the picture of the cosine function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "and remember we already had the tangent line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the tangent line was this horizontal here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that was <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can see intuitively that doesnt even tell you whether this function is above or below <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "doesnt tell you much", "entities": []}
{"text": "its sort of begging for there to be a little more information to tell us what the function is doing nearby", "entities": []}
{"text": "and indeed thats what this second expression does for us", "entities": []}
{"text": "its some kind of parabola underneath here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is a much better fit to the curve than the horizontal line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is if you like this is the best fit parabola", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the closest parabola to the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats more or less the significance", "entities": []}
{"text": "its much much closer", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right i want to give you well i think well save these other derivations for next time because i think were out of time now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well do these next time", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor well because our subject today is trig integrals and substitutions professor jerison called in his substitute teacher for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats me", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor miller", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to try to tell you about trig substitutions and trig integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill be here tomorrow to do more of the same as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is about trigonometry and maybe first thing ill do is remind you of some basic things about trigonometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i have a circle trigonometry is all based on the circle of radius 1 and centered at the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if this is an angle of <expression> up from the xaxis then the coordinates of this point are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that leads right away to some trig identities which you know very well", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to put them up here because well use them over and over again today", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember the convention <expression> secretly means <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it would be more sensible to write a parenthesis around the <expression> and then say you square that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 34}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "but everybody in the world puts the <expression> up there over the <expression> and so ill do that too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that follows just because the circle has radius <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then there are some other identities too which i think you remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill write them down here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "<expression> theres this double angle formula that says <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres also the double angle formula for the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember what that says", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to use these trig identities and im going to use them in a slightly different way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and so id like to pay a little more attention to this one and get a different way of writing this one out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is actually the half angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that says im going to try to express the <expression> in terms of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "so if i know the <expression> i want to try to express the <expression> in terms of it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "well ill start with a <expression> and play with that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know what this is its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we also know what the <expression> is in terms of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can eliminate the <expression> from this picture", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i put in what <expression> is in terms of <expression> and so thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "theres this <expression> which gets a plus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "because of these two minus signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres the one that was there before so altogether there are two of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to isolate what <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "or rather what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets solve for that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so ill put the <expression> on the other side", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i want to divide by this <expression> and so that puts a <expression> in this denominator here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 98}]}
{"text": "so some people call that the half angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "what it really is for us is its a way of eliminating powers from <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive gotten rid of this square at the expense of putting in a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well use that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and similarly same calculation shows that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "same <expression> in that formula also but it has a minus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "for the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats my little review of trig identities that well make use of as this lecture goes on", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to talk about trig identity trig integrals and you know some trig integrals im sure already", "entities": []}
{"text": "like well let me write the differential form first", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "you know that <expression> or maybe ill say <expression> is lets see thats the derivative of <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so if i integrate both sides here the integral form of this is the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "is <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "and in the same way <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i integrate that i find the integral of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so thats our starting point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the game today for the first half of the lecture is to use that basic just those basic integration formulas together with clever use of trig identities in order to compute more complicated formulas involving trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing the first topic is to think about integrals of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "where here i have in mind <expression> and <expression> are nonnegative integers", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try to integrate these", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "ill show you some applications of these pretty soon", "entities": []}
{"text": "looking down the road a little bit integrals like this show up in fourier series and many other subjects in mathematics", "entities": []}
{"text": "it turns out theyre quite important to be able to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats why were doing them now", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so there are two cases to think about here", "entities": []}
{"text": "when youre integrating things like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the easy case and lets do that one first", "entities": []}
{"text": "the easy case is when at least one exponent is odd", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the easy case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example suppose that i wanted to integrate well lets take the case <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "so im integrating <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im taking oh i could do that one", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if thats what i want to take", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "my confusion is that i meant to have this a different power", "entities": []}
{"text": "you were thinking that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do this case when <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the integral im trying to do is any power of the <expression> times the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "well heres the trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "recognize use this formula up at the top there to see <expression> as something that we already have on the blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way to exploit that is to make a substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and substitution is going to be <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres why", "entities": []}
{"text": "then this integral that im trying to do is the integral of <expression> thats already a simplification", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres that <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you make a substitution youve got to go all the way and replace everything in the expression by things involving this new variable that ive introduced", "entities": []}

{"text": "and i can do that because <expression> according to that formula is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me put a box around that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats our substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you make a substitution you also want to compute the differential of the variable that you substitute in", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 70}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 96, "end_offset": 106}]}
{"text": "so the <expression> that appears here is just exactly <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ive replaced this trig integral with something that doesnt involve trig functions at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a lot easier", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can just plug into what we know here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> plus a constant and ive done the integral", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "but im not quite done with the problem yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "because to be nice to your reader and to yourself you should go back at this point probably go back and get rid of this new variable that you introduced", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre the one who introduced this variable you", "entities": []}
{"text": "nobody except you really knows what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the rest of the world knows what they asked for the first place that involved <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have to go back and get rid of this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "and thats not hard to do in this case because <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i make this back substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the game was i use this odd power of the <expression> here and i could see it appearing as the differential of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so thats what made this substitution work", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another example to see how that works out in a slightly different case", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i do have an odd power", "entities": []}
{"text": "one of the exponents is odd so im in the easy case", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the game now is to use this trig identity to get rid of the largest even power that you can from this odd power here", "entities": []}

{"text": "watch what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is not really a substitution or anything this is just a trig identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have the remaining <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me rewrite that a little bit to see how this works out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}

{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im really exactly in the situation that i was in over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got a single power of a <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it happens that its a sine here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not going to cause any trouble we can go ahead and play the same game that i did there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so so far ive just been using trig identities", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now ill use a trig substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "and i think i want to write these as powers of a variable", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and then this is going to be the differential of that variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill take <expression> to be <expression> and that means that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "theres the substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when i make that substitution what do we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> becomes <expression> and <expression> becomes not quite <expression> watch for the signum watch for this minus sign here", "entities": []}
{"text": "it becomes <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "the minus sign comes outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can integrate both of these powers so i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "and then this 4th power gives me a 5th power when i integrate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "and dont forget the constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "am i done", "entities": []}
{"text": "not quite done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to back substitute and get rid of my choice of variable <expression> and replace it with yours", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 80, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor there should indeed", "entities": []}
{"text": "i forgot this minus sign when i came down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these two gang up to give me a plus", "entities": []}
{"text": "was that what the other question was about too", "entities": []}
{"text": "thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets back substitute", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and im going to put that over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the result is well i just replace the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "so this is <expression> plus thank you <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "and theres the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "by the way you can remember one of the nice things about doing an integral is its fairly easy to check your answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can always differentiate the thing you get and see whether you get the right thing when you go back", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}]}

{"text": "lets do one more example just to handle an example of this easy case which you might have thought of at first", "entities": []}
{"text": "suppose i just want to integrate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no <expression> in sight", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i do have an odd power of a trig function of a <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im in the easy case", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the procedure that i was suggesting says i want to take out the largest even power that i can from the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill take that out thats a <expression> and write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "well now im very happy", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its just like the situation we had somewhere on the board here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just like the situation we had up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got a power of a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so exactly the same substitution steps in", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get and maybe you can see what happens without doing the work", "entities": []}
{"text": "shall i do the work here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i make the same substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but then i want to put this minus sign in place and so that gives me <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 86}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 97}]}
{"text": "and then i back substitute and get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so this is the easy case", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you have some odd power to play with then you can make use of it and its pretty straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the harder case is when you dont have an odd power", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the program", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to do the harder case and then im going to show you an example of how to integrate square roots", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 91}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 92, "end_offset": 104}]}
{"text": "and do an application using these ideas from trigonometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to keep this blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill come back and start here again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the harder case is when theyre only even exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "im still trying to integrate the same form", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "but now all the exponents are even", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to do some game", "entities": []}
{"text": "and here the game is use the half angle formula", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "which i just erased very sadly on the board here", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill rewrite them over here so we have them on the board", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "i think i remember what they were", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the game is im going to use that half angle formula to start getting rid of those even powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "half angle formula written like this exactly talks about it rewrites even powers of sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see how that works out in an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about just the <expression> for a start", "entities": []}
{"text": "what to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "i cant pull anything out", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could rewrite this as <expression> but then id be faced with integrating the <expression> which is exactly as hard", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so instead lets use this formula here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "this is really the same as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "its got two parts to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "integrating <expression> gives me <expression> over oh", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "miraculously the <expression> turned into a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets put it back as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "i get <expression> by integrating <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so notice that something nontrigonometric occurs here when i do these even integrals", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> appears", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the other one ok so this takes a little thought", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral of the <expression> is the <expression> or is it minus the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "shall we take a vote", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think its positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so you get <expression> but is that right", "entities": []}
{"text": "over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i differentiate the <expression> this <expression> comes out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "and would give me an extra <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an extra <expression> that i have to put in here when i integrate it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 50}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "and theres the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is not a substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just played with trig identities here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then did a simple trig integral getting your help to get the sign right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thinking about what this <expression> is going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "it produces a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its not applying any complicated thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just using this identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do another example thats a little bit harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "this time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again no odd powers", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got to work a little bit harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im going to do is apply those identities up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what i recommend doing in this situation is going over to the side somewhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "and do some side work", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its all just playing with trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not actually doing any integrals for a while", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess one way to get rid of the <expression> and the <expression> is to use those identities and so lets do that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "so the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just substitute them in", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "and now i can multiply that out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "and what i have is a difference times a sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you know a formula for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "taking the product of these two things well therell be a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the numerator i get the square of this minus the square of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "  so i get that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well im a little bit happier because at least i dont have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have <expression> different squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "i still have a square and want to integrate this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "im still not in the easy case", "entities": []}
{"text": "i got myself back to an easier hard case", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we do know what to do about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i just did it up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i could play into this formula that we got", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think its just as easy to continue to calculate here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "use the half angle formula again for this and continue on your way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get a <expression> from this bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i plug in <expression> in for <expression> there in the top board im going to get a <expression> on the righthand side", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so it comes out like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i guess i could simplify that a little bit more", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh but then theres a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its half that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then i can simplify a little more", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "its <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats my side work", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just did some trig identities over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and rewrote <expression> as something which involves just no powers of trig just <expression> by itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "and a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can take that and substitute it in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now the integration is pretty easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> which is ok the <expression> is going to give me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral or <expression> is plus or minus the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of the <expression> is plus the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "so its going to be plus the only theres a minus here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the <expression> but then i have an additional factor in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats it going to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to put a <expression> there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "so weve done that calculation too", "entities": []}
{"text": "so any of these if you keep doing this kind of process these two kinds of procedures you can now integrate any expression that has a power of a <expression> times a power of a <expression> in it by using these ideas", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 97, "end_offset": 106}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "now lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh let me give you an alternate method for this last one here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i know what ill do", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give an alternate method for doing really doing the side work over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "im trying to deal with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats the square of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and <expression> shows up right here", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "in another trig identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can make use of that too", "entities": []}
{"text": "that reduces the number of factors of <expression> and <expression> by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going in the right direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "this  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> say this right", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> and then i want to square that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "so what i get is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is well im not too happy yet because i still have an even power", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember im trying to integrate this thing in the end even powers are bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "i try to get rid of them", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "by using that formula the half angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can apply that to <expression> here again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "i get <expression> of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the half angle formula says for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats exactly the same as the expression that i got up here as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same expression that i have there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its the same expression as i have here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is just an alternate way to play this game of using the half angle formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok lets do a little application of these things and change the topic a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is an application and example of a real trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres the problem i want to look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i have a circle whose radius is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i cut out from it a sort of tab here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this tab here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the height of this thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this length is a number <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to do is compute the area of that little tab", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "thats the problem", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an arc over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to find the area of this for <expression> and <expression> in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area well i guess one way to compute the area would be to take the integral of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 43}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "youve seen the idea of splitting this up into vertical strips whose height is given by a function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you integrate that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "thats an interpretation for the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "the area is given by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats a little bit awkward because my formula for <expression> is going to be a little strange", "entities": []}
{"text": "its constant value of <expression> along here and then at this point it becomes this arc of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so working this out i could do it but its a little awkward because expressing <expression> as a function of <expression> the top edge of this shape its a little awkward and takes two different regions to express", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a different way to say it is to say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe thatll work a little bit better", "entities": []}
{"text": "or maybe it wont but its worth trying", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could just as well split this region up into horizontal strips", "entities": []}
{"text": "whose width is <expression> and whose length is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now im thinking of this as a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the graph of a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats much better because the function of <expression> is well its the square root of <expression> isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what im asked to integrate then", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "square root of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can even put in limits of integration", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "maybe i should do that because this is supposed to be an actual number", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess im integrating it from <equation> thats here", "entities": []}
{"text": "to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is what i want to find", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a integral formula for the area of that region", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is a new form", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont think that youve thought about integrating expressions like this in this class before", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a new form and i want to show you how to do it how its related to trigonometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "its related to trigonometry through that exact picture that we have on the blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "after all this <expression> is the formula for this arc", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what i propose is that we try to exploit the connection with the circle and introduce polar coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here if i measure this angle then there are various things you can say", "entities": []}
{"text": "like the coordinates of this point here are <expression> <expression> well im sorry its not", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats an angle but i want to call it <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "and in general you know that the coordinates of this point are <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the radius is <expression> then the angle here is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation> and <equation> just from looking at the geometry of the circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets make that substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "im using the picture to suggest that maybe making the substitution is a good thing to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets follow along and see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "if thats true what were interested in is integrating <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is <expression> were interested in integrating the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the <expression> minus this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well thats  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats just <equation> all over again", "entities": []}
{"text": "its also <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are a lot of different ways to think of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but no matter how you say it the thing were trying to integrate <expression> is under this substitution it is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 63}]}
{"text": "so im interested in integrating the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im going to make this substitution <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so under that substitution ive decided that the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well id better compute the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so <expression> just differentiating this expression is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets put that in", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "making that trig substitution <expression> has replaced this integral that has a square root in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and no trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "with an integral that involves no square roots and only trig functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact its not too hard to integrate this now because of the work that weve done", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> comes out", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe weve done that example already today", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe we can think it through but maybe the easiest thing is to look back at notes and see what we got before", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was the first example in the hard case that i did", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what it came out to i used <expression> instead of <expression> at the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a good step forward", "entities": []}
{"text": "i started with this integral that i really didnt know how to do by any means that weve had so far", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ive replaced it by a trig integral that we do know how to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now ive done that trig integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "but were still not quite done because of the problem of back substituting", "entities": []}
{"text": "id like to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or id like to go back and rewrite it in terms of the original limits of integration that we had in the original problem", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "in doing that its going to be useful to rewrite this expression and get rid of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "after all the original <expression> was expressed in terms of <expression> not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just do that here and say that this in turn  <expression> plus well <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "and so when theres a <expression> in the denominator what ill get is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i did that because im getting closer to the original terms that the problem started with", "entities": []}
{"text": "which was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me write down the integral that we have now", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "the <expression> is so far what we know is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i want to go back and rewrite this in terms of the original value", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "the original variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what is <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> in terms of <expression> was given like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here the fearsome <expression> rears its head right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the angle so that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that <expression> is the <expression> or <expression> inverse of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the first thing that shows up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> all over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this term", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the other side here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> and <expression> we knew what they were in terms of <expression> and in terms of <expression> if you like", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill put the <expression> inside here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "that makes it a little bit nicer", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus and the other term is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "so the a <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill write this <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and so i get the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now here <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> or if you like its the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so there ive rewritten everything back in terms of the original variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres an answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive done this indefinite integration of a form of this quadratic this square root of something which is a constant minus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 109, "end_offset": 117}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 118, "end_offset": 123}]}
{"text": "whenever you see that the thing to think of is trigonometry", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to play into the <expression> identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way to exploit it is to make the substitution <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could also make a substitution <equation> if you wanted to", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and the result would come out to exactly the same in the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "im still not quite done with the original problem that i had because the original problem asked for a definite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just go back and finish that as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area was the integral from <expression> to <expression> of this square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just want to evaluate the righthand side here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "the answer that we came up with this indefinite integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to evaluate it at <expression> and at <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i evaluate it at <expression> i get <expression> which is <expression> times the <expression> putting <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "so ive plugged in <equation> into that formula this is what i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "then when i plug in <equation> well the <expression> is <expression> so the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this term goes away", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when <equation> this term is <expression> also", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i dont get any subtracted terms at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an expression for this", "entities": []}
{"text": "notice that this <expression> thats exactly this angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> its the angle that you get when <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "put this over here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that is the angle that the corner makes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could rewrite this as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "lets just think about this for a minute", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have these two terms in the sum is that reasonable", "entities": []}
{"text": "the first term is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the radius squared times this angle times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i think that is exactly the area of this sector", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the formula for the area of the sector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this one this is the vertical elevation", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the horizontal", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is this distance", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the righthand term is <expression> times <expression> thats the area of that triangle", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "so using a little bit of geometry gives you the same answer as all of this elaborate calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe thats enough cause for celebration for us to quit for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "we hopefully know at this point what a differential equation is so now lets try to solve some", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this first class of differential equations ill introduce you to theyre called separable equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think what youll find is that were not learning really anything new", "entities": []}
{"text": "using just your first year calculus derivative and integrating skills you can solve a separable equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason why theyre called separable is because you can actually separate the x and y terms and integrate them separately to get the solution of the differential equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 79}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 84, "end_offset": 97}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 111}]}
{"text": "so thats separable", "entities": []}
{"text": "separable equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do a couple and i think youll get the point", "entities": []}
{"text": "these often are really more of exercises in algebra than anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first separable differential equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually this is a good time to just review our terminology", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all what is the order of this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the highest derivative in it is just the first derivative so the order  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its first order", "entities": []}
{"text": "its ordinary because we only have a regular derivative no partial derivatives here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then is this linear or nonlinear", "entities": []}
{"text": "well first you say oh well you know this looks linear", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not multiplying the derivative times anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you look carefully something interesting is going on", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is a dependent variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to have the <expression> that makes it nonlinear", "entities": []}
{"text": "and even if this was <expression> if you were to actually multiply both sides of this equation times <expression> and get in the form that i showed you in the previous equation you would have <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 86, "end_offset": 94}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 95, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "this is actually the first step of what we have to do anyways so ill write it down", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "so if im just multiplying both sides of this equation times <expression> you get <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "and then you immediately see that even if this wasnt a squared here youd be multiplying the <expression> and that also makes it nonlinear because youre multiplying the dependent variable times the derivative of itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that also makes this a nonlinear equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway lets get back to solving this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the first step", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just multiply both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "and the real end goal is just to separate the ys and the xs and then integrate both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "so im almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what i want to do is i want to multiply both sides of this equation times <expression> so i have a <expression> here and get rid of this <expression> there", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 74}]}
{"text": "let me go here i dont want to waste too much space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have separated the <expression> and <expression> variables and the differentials", "entities": []}
{"text": "all i did is i multiplied both sides of this equation times <expression> to get here", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 53}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "now i can just integrate both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "whatever you do to one side of the equation you have to do the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats true with regular equations or differential equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "so were going to integrate both sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the integral of this expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the integral of <expression> is <expression> the integral of <expression> well thats minus <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 90}]}
{"text": "and ill write the plus <expression> here just to kind of show you something but you really dont have to write <expression> on both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "ill call the plus the constant due to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "the <expression> integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll never see this in a calculus class but i just want to make a point here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just want to show you that our plus c has never disappeared from when we were taking our traditional antiderivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the derivative of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is also going to have <expression> due to the <expression> variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the reason why i did this magenta one in magenta and i labelled it like that is because you really just have to write <expression> on one side of the equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "and if that doesnt make a lot of sense lets subtract this <expression> from both sides and we get <expression> minus let me scroll down a little bit my <expression> looks like a <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 116}]}
{"text": "<equation> plus the constant when we took the antiderivative of the <expression> minus the constant of the antiderivative when we took the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 81, "end_offset": 86}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 91, "end_offset": 121}]}
{"text": "but these two constants theyre just constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean we dont know what they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are arbitrary constants", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could just write a general <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you could have just you have to have a constant but it doesnt have to be on both sides of the equation because theyre arbitrary", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> well thats still just another constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if we want to simplify this equation more we can multiply both sides of this by <expression> just make it look nicer", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 31}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 45}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "and you get <equation> plus well i could write <expression> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "but once again <expression> is an arbitrary constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> times an arbitrary constant thats just another arbitrary constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill write the <expression> there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "and there you have it", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have solved this differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "although it is in implicit form right now and its fairly hard to get it out of implicit form", "entities": []}
{"text": "we could put the <expression> on one side so the solution could be <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "some people might like that little bit better", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and notice the solution just like when you take an antiderivative the solution is a class of implicit functions in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "and why is it a class", "entities": []}
{"text": "because we have that constant there", "entities": []}
{"text": "depending on what number you pick there it will be another solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "but any constant there will satisfy the original differential equation which was up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this was the original differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you want to solve for that constant someone has to give you an initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "someone has to say well when <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you could solve for <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway lets do another one that gives us an initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this ones a little bit ill start over", "entities": []}
{"text": "clear image different colors so i have optimal space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one is the first derivative of <expression> with respect to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a parentheses not an absolute value", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they give us initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "they say that <expression> of <expression> is  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so once we solve this differential equation and this is a separable differential equation then we can use this initial condition when <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> to figure out the constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets first separate this equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "so lets multiply both sides by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "and you get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "multiply both sides times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "this is really just an exercise in algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can multiply this one out too you get <expression> thats just this <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "i multiplied both sides times <expression> so that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have separated the equations", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive separated the independent from the dependent variable and their relative differentials and so now i can integrate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 117}]}
{"text": "and i can integrate in magenta", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "whats the antiderivative of this expression with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets just see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i wont write the <expression> ill just do it on the right hand side", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the antiderivative is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that <expression> kind of takes care of the constant for both sides of the equation and hopefully you understand why from the last example", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we can solve for <expression> using the initial condition <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "when <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets put <expression> as <expression> so we get <expression> thats the value of <expression>  when <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so when <equation> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is fairly straightforward", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of these this is all <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is lets see <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> thats plus <expression>  <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and we get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the implicit exact solution the solution of our differential equation remember now its not a class because they gave us an initial condition is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we figured out thats what <expression> was", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually if you want you could write this in an explicit form by completing the square", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "this is just algebra this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "youre done", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is an implicit form", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you wanted to make it explicit you could add <expression> to both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "im just completing the square here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i add <expression> to that side i have to add <expression> to this side so it becomes <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 45, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "i just added <expression> to both sides of the equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "why did i do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i wanted this side to be a perfect square in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i can rewrite this side as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "then i could say <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can add <expression> to both sides and then i can get <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and it has plus or minus here and if we have to pick one of the two wed go back to the initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "well our initial condition told us that <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we put <expression> here for <expression> we get <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "so <expression> plus or minus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <expression> is going to be  negative <expression> so we get <equation> sorry <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if this is going to be  <expression> then this has to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the explicit form that satisfies our initial condition and were getting a little geeky here you could get rid of the plus its 1 minus this whole thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what satisfies our initial condition", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you could figure out where its satisfied over what domain is it satisfied", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats satisfied when this term is positive this becomes negative and you get its undefined in reals and all of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "but anyway ive run out of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so were going to continue to talk about trig integrals and trig substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is maybe the most technical part of this course which maybe is why professor jerison decided to just take a leave go awol just now and let me take over for him", "entities": []}
{"text": "but ill do my best to help you learn this technique and itll be useful for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve talked about trig integrals involving sines and cosines yesterday", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres another whole world out there that involves these other trig polynomials trig functions secant and tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me just make a little table to remind you what they are", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i have trouble remembering myself so i enjoy the opportunity to go back to remind myself of this stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the secant is one over one of those things which one is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its weird its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course the tangent we know", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the <expression> over the <expression> and the <expression> is the other way around", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you put a co in front of it it exchanges <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "well i have a few identities involving tangent and secant up there in that little prepared blackboard up above", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe ill just go through and check that out to make sure that were all on the same page with them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to claim that theres this trig identity at the top", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just check that out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is <expression> so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whenever you see a <expression> in trigonometry youll always have the option of writing as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i do that then i can divide the <expression> into that first term", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there you go", "entities": []}
{"text": "that checks the first one", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the main trig identity thats going to be behind what i talk about today", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the trigonometry identity part", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about this piece of calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "can we calculate what the derivative of <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "actually im going to do that on this board", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i think i was with you when we learned about the quotient rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "computing the derivative of a quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the rule is you take the numerator and you sorry you take the derivative of the numerator which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 38}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 61}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "and you multiply it by the denominator so that gives you <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and then you take the numerator take minus the numerator and multiply that by the derivative of the denominator which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "and you put all that over the square of the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "and now i look at that and before my eyes i see the same trig identity <equation> appearing there", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what the claim was", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of the <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that immediately gives you an integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely the integral of <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the fundamental theorem of calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we verified the first integral there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets just do the second one as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if i want to differentiate the <expression> derivative of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again i have a quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "this ones a little easier because the numerators so simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i take the derivative of the numerator which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "and then i take the numerator i take minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 36}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 56}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 62}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "which is <expression> and put all that over the square of the same denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so one minus sign came from the quotient rule and the other one came because thats the derivative of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "but they cancel and so i get <expression> which is <expression> and so thats the <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so not hard", "entities": []}
{"text": "that verifies that the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it tells you that the integral of that weird thing in case you ever want to know the integral of the <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there are a couple more integrals that i want to do for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "where i cant sort of work backwards like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets calculate the integral of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "just do this straight out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now theres a habit of mind that i hope you get into", "entities": []}
{"text": "when you see the <expression> and youre calculating an integral like this its useful to remember what the derivative of the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "because maybe it shows up somewhere else in the integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that happens here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that suggests we make a substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "which means <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the numerator except for the minus sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i can rewrite this as under the substitution i can rewrite this as <expression> thats the numerator <expression> is <expression> divided by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 146}]}
{"text": "well i know how to do that integral too", "entities": []}
{"text": "that gives me the natural log doesnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "im not quite done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have to backsubstitute and replace this new variable that ive made up called <expression> with what it is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 24}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "and what you get is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the integral of the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now you find these tables of integrals in the back of the book", "entities": []}
{"text": "things like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not sure how much memorization professor jerison is going to ask of you but there is a certain amount of memorization that goes on in calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is one of the kinds of things that you probably want to know", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do one more integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think im making my way through a prepared board here lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the integral of the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "id also like to know what the integral of the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont know a way to kind of go straight at this but let me show you a way to think your way through to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take these two facts <expression> is what it is and <expression> is what it is and add them together i get this fact", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "that the derivative of the <expression> is well its the sum of these two things", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres a <expression> that occurs in both of those terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill factor it out", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "and that gives me ill put it over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the <expression> that occurs in both terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in one term theres another <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in the other term theres a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats interesting somehow because this same term appears on both sides of this equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write <expression> for that <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "and so the equation that i get is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive just made a direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "just decide that im going to write <expression> for that single thing that occurs on both sides of the equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "so <expression> is on the left and <expression> is on the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theres my secant", "entities": []}
{"text": "that i was trying to integrate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and what it tells you is that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "just divide both sides by <expression> and i get this equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 11}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "<expression> that has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "not sure that professor jerisons used this in this class but <expression> weve actually used something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its on the board right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a logarithmic derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe its easier to read this from right to left if i want to calculate the derivative of <expression> well the chain rule says i get the derivative of <expression> times the derivative of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 62, "end_offset": 71}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 89}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 112, "end_offset": 122}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 130, "end_offset": 133}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 151}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 165, "end_offset": 170}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 171, "end_offset": 188}]}
{"text": "so often <expression> is called the logarithmic derivative", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "but its done what i wanted", "entities": []}
{"text": "because its expressed the secant as a derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i guess i should put in what <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that implies that the integral integrate both sides", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 47}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "that says that the integral of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the last line in this little memo that i created", "entities": []}
{"text": "that we can use now for the rest of the class", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions about that trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a trick i have nothing more to say about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next thing i oh yes so now i want to make the point that using these rules and some thought you can now integrate most trigonometric polynomials", "entities": []}
{"text": "most things that involve powers of <expression> and <expression> and <expression> and <expression> and everything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example lets try to integrate the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "big power of the <expression> function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well there are too many <expression> there for me", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take some away", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i can take them away by using that trig identity <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to replace two of those <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "that leaves me with two left over", "entities": []}
{"text": "now there was method to my madness", "entities": []}
{"text": "because ive got a <expression> left over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that suggests a substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely lets say lets let <equation> so that <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and i have both terms that occur in my integral sitting there very nicely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the possibility of making this substitution and seeing a secant squared up here as part of the differential here", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why it was a good idea for me to take two of the <expression> and write them as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 43}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 77}]}
{"text": "so now i can continue this", "entities": []}
{"text": "under that substitution i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh yeah and i should add the other fact that well i guess its obvious that <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> <expression> that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats pretty easy to integrate", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and then i just have to backsubstitute", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "put things back in terms of the original variables", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}]}
{"text": "and that gives me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres the answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could spend a lot more time doing more examples of this kind of polynomial trig thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "its probably best for you to do some practice on your own", "entities": []}
{"text": "because i want to talk about other things also", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to talk about is the use of these trig identities in making really trig substitution integration", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we did a little bit of this yesterday and ill show you some more examples today", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets start with a pretty hard example right off the bat", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is going to be the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a pretty bad looking integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how can we approach this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the square root is the ugliest part of the integral i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "what we should try to do is write this square root in some nicer way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 50}]}
{"text": "that is figure out a way to write <expression> as a square", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "thatll get rid of the square root", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so there is an example of a way to write <expression> plus something squared in a different way", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 58}]}
{"text": "and its right up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to use that idea", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i see this form that suggests that we make a trig substitution and write <expression> as the <expression> of some new variable", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "which you might as well call <expression> to because its like an angle", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "then <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "according to that trig identity", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this identity is the reason that the substitution is going to help us", "entities": []}
{"text": "because it gets rid of the square root and replaces it by some other trig function", "entities": []}
{"text": "id better be able to get rid of the <expression> too", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats part of the substitution process", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we can do that because i know what the derivative of the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just substitute all of that stuff in and rewrite the entire integral in terms of our new variable <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 56}]}
{"text": "so <expression> is in the numerator", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then the denominator well it has an <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres this square root", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know what that is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now", "entities": []}
{"text": "weve done the trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive gotten rid of the square root ive got everything in terms of trig functions of the new variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "pretty complicated trig function", "entities": []}
{"text": "this often happens you wind up with a complete scattering of different trig functions in the numerator and denominator and everything", "entities": []}
{"text": "a systematic thing to do here is to put everything in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "unless you can see right away how its going to simplify the systematic thing to do is to rewrite in terms of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 89, "end_offset": 96}]}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to put a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 41, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "oh i guess the first thing i can do is cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats clever", "entities": []}
{"text": "you were all thinking that too", "entities": []}
{"text": "cancel those", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now i just get <expression> denominator from <expression> there in the numerator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "its still pretty complicated <expression> who knows", "entities": []}
{"text": "well well find out", "entities": []}
{"text": "because the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i should put a <expression> where the <expression> was and <expression> up there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "and i still have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you see some more cancellation occurs", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the virtue of writing things out in this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the square here cancels with this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a little simpler", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it puts me in a position to use the same idea i just used", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see the <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i might look around in this integral to see if its derivative occurs anywhere", "entities": []}
{"text": "the differential of the <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so im very much inclined to make another substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "say <expression> direct substitution this time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and say <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then <expression> oh im sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "say <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this integral becomes well the numerator just is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the denominator is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think we can break out the champagne because we can integrate that one", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 58, "end_offset": 67}]}
{"text": "finally get rid of the integral sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes sir", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor ok how do i know to make <equation> rather than <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "because i want to see <expression> appear up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "if id had a <expression> up here that would be a signal to me that maybe i should say let <expression> be the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "also because this thing in the denominator is something i want to get rid of", "entities": []}
{"text": "its in the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ill get rid of it by wishful thinking and just call it something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "it works pretty well in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "wishful thinking doesnt always work so well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i integrate <expression> and i get <expression> plus a constant and im done with the calculus part of this problem", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "ive done the integral now", "entities": []}
{"text": "gotten rid of the integral sign", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im not quite done with the problem yet because i have to work my way back through two substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "first this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this first substitution isnt so bad to get rid of to undo to backsubstitute", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 60}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 78}]}
{"text": "because <expression> is just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so <expression> is i guess a fancy way to write it is the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "<expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 26}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "is there a question in the back", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes sir", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor im sorry my hearing is so bad", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor how did i know this substitution in the first place", "entities": []}
{"text": "its because of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i want to make use of the trig identity in the upper lefthand corner", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "ill make you a table in a few minutes that will put all this in a bigger context", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think itll help you then", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok ill promise", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what i want to try to talk about right now is how to rewrite a term like this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 63}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 70}]}
{"text": "a trig term like this back in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to undo this trick substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "this is a trig sub", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i want to do now is try to undo that trig sub", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 40}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 46, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "and ill show you a general method for undoing trig substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "this happens quite often", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know what the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i do know what the <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to make a relation between them", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 17}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "ok so undoing", "entities": []}
{"text": "trig subs", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets go back to where trigonometry always comes from this right angled triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> in the corner and then these three sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "this ones called the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one is called the <expression> and that ones called the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets find out where <expression> lies in this triangle", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "lets try to write the sides of this triangle in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 17}]}
{"text": "and what i know is <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the tangent of <expression> tangent of this angle is opposite divided by adjacent", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 75}]}
{"text": "did you learn soh cah toa", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "ok so its opposite divided by adjacent", "entities": []}
{"text": "is the tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there are different ways to do that but why not just do it in the simplest way and suppose that the adjacent is <expression> and the opposite is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is correct now isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get the correct value for the tangent of theta by saying that the lengths of those are <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means that the hypotenuse has length <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well heres a triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "im interested in computing the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "wheres that appear in the triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> is opposite over hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the cosecant is hypotenuse over opposite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the hypotenuse is <expression> and the opposite is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so ive done it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive undone the trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive figured out what this cosecant of <expression> is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the final answer is minus the <expression> plus a constant and theres an answer to the original problem", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 50, "end_offset": 54}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 55, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "this took two boards to go through this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i illustrated several things", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually this three half boards", "entities": []}
{"text": "i illustrated this use of trig substitution and ill come back to that in a second", "entities": []}
{"text": "i illustrated patience", "entities": []}
{"text": "i illustrated rewriting things in terms of sines and cosines and then making a direct substitution to evaluate an integral like this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"text": "and then theres this undoing all of those substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it culminated with undoing the trig sub", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets play a game here", "entities": []}
{"text": "why dont we play the game where you give me so theres a step in here that i should have done", "entities": []}
{"text": "i shouldve said this is <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 41}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 52}]}
{"text": "the most straightforward thing you can do is to say since <expression> is the tangent of <expression> that means that sorry if <expression> that means that <expression> is the arctangent of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so lets just put in <expression> as the arctangent of <expression> and thats what you get", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so really what i just did for you was to show you a way to compute some trig function applied to the inverse of another trig function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 59, "end_offset": 66}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 72, "end_offset": 85}]}
{"text": "i computed cosecant of the arctangent by this trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets play the game where you give me a trig function and an inverse trig function and i try to compute what the composite is", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so who can give me a trig function", "entities": []}
{"text": "has to be one of these standard ones", "entities": []}
{"text": "student tan", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "alright", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about another one", "entities": []}
{"text": "student <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "do we have agreement on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor right <expression> has the best cheer", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the game", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have to compute try to compute that composite", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "something wrong with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor what does acceptable mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "dont you think so the question is isnt this a perfectly acceptable final answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a correct final answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is much more insightful", "entities": []}
{"text": "and after all the original thing was involving square roots and things this is the kind of thing you might hope for is an answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just a nicer answer for sure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and likely to be more useful to you when you go on and use that answer for something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets try to do this this", "entities": []}
{"text": "undo a trig substitution that involved a cosecant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 7, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and i manipulate around and i find myself trying to find out whats the tangent of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so heres how we go about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i draw this triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the angle here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the adjacent opposite hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing is how can i make the cosecant appear here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what dimensions should i give to the sides in order for the cosecant of <expression> sorry in order for <expression> to be the cosecant of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that the cosecant of <expression> that means the cosecant of <expression> should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is the arccosecant so <expression> is the cosecant of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whatll i take the sides to be to get the cosecant", "entities": []}
{"text": "the cosecant is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> is the opposite over the hypotenuse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get hypotenuse over opposite", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats supposed to be what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could make the opposite anything i want but the simplest thing is to make it <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what does that mean about the rest of the sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "hypotenuse had better be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then ive recovered this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres a triangle that exhibits the correct angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "this remaining side is going to be useful to us", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive got a triangle of the correct angle <expression> and now i want to compute the tangent of that angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats opposite divided by adjacent", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "very flexible tool thatll be useful to you in many different times", "entities": []}
{"text": "whenever you have to undo a trig substitution this is likely to be useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok that was a good game", "entities": []}
{"text": "no winners in this game", "entities": []}
{"text": "were all winners", "entities": []}
{"text": "no losers were all winners", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me make this table of the different trig substitutions and how they can be useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "summary of trig substitutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so over here we have if you see so if your integrand contains make a substitution to get", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if your integrand contains ill write these things out as square roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "if it contains the <expression> this is what we talked about on thursday", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i was trying to find the area of that piece of a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "there i suggested that we should make the substitution <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "either one works just as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres no way to prefer one over the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when you make the substitution <equation> you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this expression becomes  this expression under that substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "then youve gotten rid of the square root and youve got a trigonometric integral that you have to try to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you made the substitution <expression> youd get <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you can go ahead as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just saw another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "namely if you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats like the example we had up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> in this example", "entities": []}
{"text": "what did we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "we tried the substitution <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the reason is that i can plug into the trig identity up here in the upper left", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "and replace <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres one more thing in this table", "entities": []}
{"text": "sort of the only remaining sum or difference of terms like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats what happens if you have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so there i think we can make a substitution a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because after all <expression> so <expression>  <expression> sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see what happens when i make that substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 51}]}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "under this substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well put the <expression> on the other side", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 8}]}
{"text": "and you find <expression> coming out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats what you get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "after i take the square root i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "so these are the three basic trig substitution forms", "entities": []}
{"text": "where trig substitutions are useful to get rid of expressions like this and replace them by trigonometric expressions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you use this trick you do the integral if you can and then you use this trick to get rid of the <expression> at the end", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 90, "end_offset": 100}]}
{"text": "so now the last thing i want to talk about today is called completing the square", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that comes in because unfortunately not every square root of a quadratic has such a simple form", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will often encounter things that are not just the square root of something simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "like one of these forms", "entities": []}
{"text": "like there might be a middle term in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont actually have time to show you an example of how this comes out in a sort of practical example", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it does happen quite frequently", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i want to show you how to deal with things like the following example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets try to integrate <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "so theres a square root of some square some quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "its very much like this business", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it isnt of any of these forms", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so what i want to do is show you how to rewrite it in one of those forms using substitution again", "entities": []}
{"text": "all this is about substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the game is to rewrite quadratic as something like <expression> plus something or other", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 25}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 35}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 71}]}
{"text": "plus some other constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "so write it try to write it in the form of a square plus or minus another constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 8}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "and then well go on from there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you square this form out then the middle term is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that since i have a middle term here i pretty much know what a has to be", "entities": []}
{"text": "the only choice in order to get something like <expression> out of this is to take a to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "because then this is what you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "this isnt quite right yet but lets compute what i have here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "<expression> so far so good plus <expression> and i dont have a plus <expression> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 32}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 64, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "so i have to fix that by subtracting <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what i mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive completed the square", "entities": []}
{"text": "the word for this process of eliminating the middle term by using the square of an expression like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats called completing the square", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can use that process to compute this integral", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i can rewrite this integral rewrite this denominator like this", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "and then im going to try to use one of these forms over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in order to get a single variable there instead of something complicated like <expression> im inclined to come up with another variable name and write it  write <expression> as that other variable name", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 158, "end_offset": 163}]}
{"text": "so heres another little direct substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "figure out what du is", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats pretty easy", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then rewrite the integral in those terms", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 16}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then in the denominator i have well i have the square root of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh yeah so i think as part of this ill write out what <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "the point is its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the data box containing the substitution data", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now i can put that in", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "i have <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "in terms of <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well now im in a happier position because i can look for <expression> for something like that in my table here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it actually sits down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so except for the use of the letter <expression> here instead of <expression> over there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "that tells me what i want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to handle this what i should use is a trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the trig substitution thats suggested is according to the bottom line with <equation> so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the suggestion is i should take <expression> but id better not use the letter x any more", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i dont have a letter <expression> i have the letter <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should take <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "and then some letter i havent used before", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is available", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a lookup table process", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see the <expression> i see that thats of this form", "entities": []}
{"text": "im instructed to make this substitution", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and thats what i just did", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see how it works out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means the <expression> is <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the derivative of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is heres the payoff", "entities": []}
{"text": "im supposed to be able to rewrite that in terms of the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 26, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "according to this", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor but i squared it", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now ill square root it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "and ill get a <expression> and this tangent will go away", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 11}]}
{"text": "so theres my data box for this substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets go on to another board", "entities": []}
{"text": "so where im at is the integral of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have all the data i need here to rewrite that in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 39, "end_offset": 46}]}
{"text": "so <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the denominator is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ha", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so some very nice simplification happens here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression>s cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the <expression> cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im left with trying to work with the integral <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and luckily enough at the very beginning of the hour i worked out how to compute the integral of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> plus a constant", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "and were done with the calculus part", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres no more integral there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i still am not quite done with the problem because again i have these two substitutions to try to undo", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 102, "end_offset": 106}]}
{"text": "so lets undo them one by one", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have this trig substitution here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i could use my triangle trick if i need to", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe i dont need to", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see do i know what the <expression> is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "do i know what the <expression> is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i do", "entities": []}
{"text": "its here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i lucked out in this case", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i dont have to go through and use that triangle trick", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive undone this trig substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not quite done yet because my answer is involved with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what i wanted originally was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this direct substitution that i started with is really easy to deal with", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can just put <expression> every time i see a <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "so this is <expression> plus the square root", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats going to happen when i put <expression> in place for <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "you know what you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get exactly what we started with", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i put <expression> in place of the <expression> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}]}
{"text": "i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive gotten back to a function purely in terms of <expression> ok thats a good place to quit", "entities": []}
{"text": "have a great little oneday break", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess this class doesnt meet on monday anyway", "entities": []}
{"text": "bye", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you remember last time we looked at parametric equations   as a way of describing the motion of a point that moves in the plane or in space as a function of time of your favorite parameter that will tell you how far the motion has progressed", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think we did it in detail the example of the cycloid which is the curve traced by a point on a wheel thats rolling on a flat surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have this example where we have this wheel thats rolling on the xaxis and we have this point on the wheel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as it moves around it traces a trajectory that moves more or less like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so im trying a new color", "entities": []}
{"text": "is this visible from the back", "entities": []}
{"text": "so no more blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so remember in general we are trying to find the position so <expression> <expression> maybe <expression> if we are in space   of a moving point along a trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "and one way to think about this is in terms of the position vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so position vector is just the vector whose components are coordinates of a point ok so if you prefer thats the same thing as a vector from the origin to the moving point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe our point is here <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this vector here  this vector here is vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats also the position vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just to give you again that example   if i take the cycloid for a wheel of radius <expression> and lets say that we are going at unit speed so that the angle that we used as a parameter of time is the same thing as time when the position vector in this case we found to be just to make sure that they have it right ", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats a formula that you should have in your notes from last time except we had <expression> instead of <expression> because we were using the angle", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now im saying we are moving at unit speed so time and angle are the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now whats interesting about this is we can analyze the motion in more detail", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now that we know the position of the point as a function of time we can try to study how it varies in particular things like the speed and acceleration", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets start with speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in fact we can do better than speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets not start with speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so speed is a number", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells you how fast you are going along your trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean if youre driving in a car then it tells you how fast you are going", "entities": []}
{"text": "but unless you have one of these fancy cars with a gps it doesnt tell you which direction youre going", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats useful information too if youre trying to figure out what your trajectory is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact theres two aspects to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is how fast you are going and the other is in what direction youre going", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means actually we should use a vector maybe to think about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so thats called the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way we can get it so its called usually <expression> so <expression> here stands for velocity more than for vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you just get it by taking the derivative of a position vector with respect to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now its our first time writing this kind of thing with a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the basic rule is you can take the derivative of a vector quantity just by taking the derivatives of each component", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats just <expression> <expression> and if you have <expression> component <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me  ok so  ok so lets see what it is for the cycloid", "entities": []}
{"text": "so an example of a cycloid well so what do we get when we take the derivatives of this formula there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "very good", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats at least one thing you should remember from single variable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "hopefully you remember even more than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells us at any time how fast we are going and in what direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example observe", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember last time at the end of class we were trying to figure out what exactly happens near the bottom point when we have this motion that seems to stop and go backwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we answered that one way", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try to understand it in terms of velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if i plug <equation> in here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "then <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the velocity is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at the time at that particular time our point is actually not moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course its been moving just before and it starts moving just afterwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the instant at that particular instant the speed is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats especially maybe a counterintuitive thing but something is moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at that time its actually stopped", "entities": []}
{"text": "now lets see so thats the vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its useful", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you want just the usual speed as a number then what will you do", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you will just take exactly the magnitude of this vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so speed which is the scalar quantity is going to be just the magnitude of the vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in this case while it would be <expression> and if you expand that you will get let me take a bit more space its going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it seems to simplify a little bit because we have <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its going to be the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at this point if i was going to ask you when is the speed the smallest or the largest", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could answer based on that", "entities": []}
{"text": "see at <equation> well that turns out to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the point is not moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "at <equation> that ends up being <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats when youre truly at the top of the arch and thats when the point is moving the fastest", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact they are spending twice as fast as the wheel because the wheel is moving to the right at unit speed and the wheel is also rotating", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its moving to the right and unit speed relative to the center so that the two effects add up and give you a speed of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "anyway thats a formula we can get", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now what about acceleration", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you might think acceleration is just the directive of speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "if my car goes <expression> miles an hour on the highway and its going a constant speed its not accelerating", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets say that im taking a really tight turn", "entities": []}
{"text": "then im going to feel something", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is some force being exerted", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the definition will take effect", "entities": []}
{"text": "the acceleration is as a vector and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so even if the speed is constant that means even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same the velocity vector can still rotate", "entities": []}
{"text": "and as it rotates it uses acceleration", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and so this is the notion of acceleration thats relevant to physics when you find <equation> thats the a that you have in mind here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course if you are moving in a straight line then the two notions are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean acceleration is also going to be along the line and its going to has to do with the derivative of speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general thats not quite the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example lets look at the cycloid", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we take the example of the cycloid well whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the acceleration vector is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in particular lets look at what happens at time <equation> when the point is not moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the acceleration vector there will be <expression> from <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what that means is that if i look at my trajectory at this point that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the unit vector in the vertical direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so my point is not moving at that particular time", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its accelerating up", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that actually as it comes down first its slowing down", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it stops here and then it reverses going back up", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because thats the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i should insist maybe on one thing which is that so we can differentiate vectors just component by component ok and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that well see in a moment", "entities": []}
{"text": "one thing that we cannot do its not true that the length of dr dt which is the speed  the length of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok this is completely false", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they are really not the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you have to differentiate the length of a vector but basically you are in trouble", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you really really want to do it well the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root and the chain rule and various other things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can get there", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it will not be a very nice expression", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is no simple formula for this kind of thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "fortunately we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because after all its not a very relevant quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats more relevant might be this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is actually the speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one i dont know what it means", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets continue our exploration", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next concept that i want to define is that of arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "so arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you are in a car you know it has mileage counter that tells you how far youve gone how much fuel youve used if its a fancy car", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the usual notation that we will have is <expression> for arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not quite sure how you get an <expression> out of this but its the usual notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> is for distance traveled along the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that makes sense of course we need to fix a reference point", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe on the cycloid wed say its a distance starting on the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "in general maybe you would say you start at time <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its a convention", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you knew in advance you could have actually your cars mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean that would be sneakyfreaky but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <expression> and gets to <expression> at the end of a trajectory or anything you want", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean arc length could be positive or negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "typically its negative what you are before the reference point and positive afterwards", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now how does it relate to the things weve seen there", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so in particular how do you relate arc length and time", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so theres a simple relation which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time well thats going to be the speed at which you are moving ok because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance youre covering per unit time", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and in fact to be completely honest i should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you dont want to keep counting arc length all the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually maybe you want to say that the arc length increases and then decreases along the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean you get to choose how you count it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in this case if you are moving back and forth it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase then decrease increase again and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so if you want to know really what the arc length is then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is you have this nicelooking curve how long is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well youd have to basically integrate this quantity from <equation> to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and to say the truth i dont really know how to integrate that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we dont actually have a formula for the length at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "however well see one later using a cool trick and multivariable calculus", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for now well just leave the formula like that and we dont know how long it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats the best i can offer", "entities": []}
{"text": "now another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the usual notation is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it has a hat because its a unit vector and <expression> because its tangent", "entities": []}
{"text": "now how do we get this unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should have pointed out before that if youre moving along some trajectory say youre going in that direction then when youre at this point the velocity vector is going to be tangential to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells you the direction of motion in particular", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction all you have to do is rescale it so at its length becomes one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> divided by a magnitude of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see what we can say", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can say that <expression> by <expression> so thats the velocity vector thats the same thing as if i use the chain rule <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 111}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 116, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "ok so lets think about this things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this guy here weve just seen", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same as the speed ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this one here should be <expression> divided by its length", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means this actually should be the unit vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me rewrite that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe if i actually stated directly that way see im just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "the length is the speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "the direction is tangent to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the speed is <expression> and the vector is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats how we get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try just to see why <expression> should be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets think of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> means position vector <expression> means you have the origin which is somewhere out there and the vector <expression> is here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> means we move by a small amount <expression> along the trajectory a certain distance <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we look at how the position vector changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well well have a small change", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me call that vector <expression> corresponding to the size corresponding to the length <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now <expression> should be essentially roughly  well its direction will be tangent to the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take a small enough interval then the direction will be almost tensioned to the trajectory times the length of it will be <expression> the distance that i have traveled", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}]}
{"text": "ok sorry maybe i should explain that on a separate board", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets say that we have that amount of time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets zoom into that curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <expression> at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have <expression> at time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this vector here i will call <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 28}]}
{"text": "the length of this vector is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the direction is essentially that of a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> thats the distance traveled divided by the time", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be close to the speed", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is approximately <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now if i divide both sides by <expression> i get this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i take the limit as <expression> turns to <expression> then i get the same formula with the derivatives and with an equality", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 13}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "its an approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "the approximation becomes better and better if i go to smaller intervals", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok are there any questions about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes thats correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets be more careful actually", "entities": []}
{"text": "so youre asking about whether the <expression> is actually strictly tangent to the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that  thats correct", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually <expression> is not strictly tangent to anything", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should draw another picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "if im going from here to here then <expression> is going to be this arc inside the curve while the vector will be going in this direction ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they are not strictly parallel to each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats why its only approximately ", "entities": []}
{"text": "similarly this distance the length of <expression> is not exactly the length along the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually a bit shorter", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if we imagine a smaller and smaller portion of the curve then this effect of the curve being a curve and not a straight line becomes more and more negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you zoom into the curve sufficiently then it looks more and more like a straight line", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then what i said becomes true in the limit", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens next", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me show you a nice example of why we might want to use vectors to study parametric curves because after all a lot of whats here you can just do in coordinates", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we dont really need vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "well and truly vectors being a language you never strictly need it but its useful to have a notion of vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to tell you a bit about keplers second law of celestial mechanics", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that goes back to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats not exactly recent news ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "but still i think its a very interesting example of why you might want to use vector methods to analyze motions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happened back then was kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move", "entities": []}
{"text": "before him people were saying well they cannot move in a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe its more complicated than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "they have more and more complicated theories", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres actually three laws but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what keplers second law says is that the motion of planets is first of all they move in a plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and second the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry is swept at constant rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "from the sun to the planet it is swept out by the line at a constant rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats an interesting law because it tells you once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like it tells you how fast its going to move on that orbit", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me explain again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this law says maybe the sun lets put the sun here at the origin and lets have a planet", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the planet orbits around the sun   in some trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is supposed to be light blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "can you see that its different from white", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok me neither", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter ok it doesnt really matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the planet moves on its orbit", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you wait for a certain time then a bit later it would be here and then here and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "then you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in particular if a planet is closer to the sun then it has to go faster", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if its farther away from the sun then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a very sophisticated prediction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations and trying to measure what was true that wasnt true", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact what happens is that newton so newton was quite a bit later", "entities": []}
{"text": "that was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century", "entities": []}
{"text": "so he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and youll see that if we reformulate keplers law in terms of vectors and if we work a bit with these vectors we are going to end up with something thats actually completely obvious to us now", "entities": []}
{"text": "at the time it was very far from obvious but to us now to completely obvious", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try to see what does keplers law say in terms of vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it might be good to think of maybe the position vector and maybe its variation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we wait a certain amount of time well have a vector <expression> which is the change in position vector a various interval of time", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets start with the first step", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the most complicated thing in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "its this area swept out by the line", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we express that area in terms of vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "well ive almost given the answer by drawing this picture right", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take a sufficiently small amount of time this shaded part looks like a triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to find the area of the triangle", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know how to do that now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area is approximately  one half of the area of a parallelogram that i could form from these vectors", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i should say this is the area swept in time <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you should think of <expression> as relatively small", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean the scale of a planet that might still be a few days but small compared to the other old trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets remember that the amount by which we moved <expression> is approximately  <expression> ok and just using the definition of a velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets use that", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry so its approximately  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can take out the <expression> which is scalar", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now what does it mean to say that area is swept at a constant rate", "entities": []}
{"text": "it means this thing is proportional to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means so the law says in fact that the length of this cross product <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok <expression> has constant length", "entities": []}
{"text": "any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes let me try to explain that again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what im claiming is that the length of the cross products <expression> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "i should say with a vector of one half of this length is the rate at which area is swept", "entities": []}
{"text": "how do we see that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets take a small time interval <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in time <expression> our planet moves by <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if it moves by <expression> it means that this triangle up there has two sides", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is the position vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other one is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula weve seen for the area of a triangle in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the area is one half of the cross product <expression> and <expression> magnitude of the cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to say that the rate at which area is swept is constant means that these two are proportional", "entities": []}
{"text": "area divided by <expression> is constant at our time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so this is constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now what about the other half of the law", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it says that the motion is in a plane and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it contains also the sun", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it contains the trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets think about that plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i claim that the position vector is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats what we are saying", "entities": []}
{"text": "but there is another vector that i know it is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "you could say the position vector at another time or at any time but in fact whats also true is that the velocity vector is in the plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok if im moving in the plane then position and velocity are in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the plane of motion contains <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the direction of the cross product <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its the direction thats perpendicular to this plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its normal to the plane of motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means now that actually weve put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <expression> has constant length and constant direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact in general maybe i should say something about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you just look at the position vector and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time then together they determine some plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the plane that contains the origin the point and the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you want its the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time", "entities": []}
{"text": "now of course if your motion is not in a plane then that plane will change", "entities": []}
{"text": "its however instant if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time", "entities": []}
{"text": "and to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so  laughter applause ok so keplers second law is actually equivalent to saying that <equation> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the law says", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in terms of derivatives it means <expression> is the <expression> vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now so theres an interesting thing to note which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions with dot products or cross products", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres only one catch which is that when we differentiate a cross product we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left", "entities": []}
{"text": "the guy on the right stays on the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so if you know that <expression> then you are safe", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you know it as <expression> then you are not safe", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its the only thing to watch for", "entities": []}
{"text": "so product rule is ok for taking the derivative of a dot product", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you dont actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product", "entities": []}
{"text": "there you just need to be a little bit more careful", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now that we know that we can write this as <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets reformulate things slightly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> already has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats what we call the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is <expression> what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the acceleration <expression>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now whats the next step", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know what <expression> is because remember a vector cross itself is always <expression> ok", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so this is the same <equation> and thats the same as saying that the cross product of two vectors is <expression> exactly when the parallelogram of the form has no area", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means the acceleration is parallel to the position", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in fact what keplers second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and since we know that acceleration is caused by a force thats equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force   is parallel to the position vector that means well if you have the sun here at the origin and if you have your planets well the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact the law doesnt even say whether its going towards the sun or away from the sun", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what we know now is that of course the attraction is towards the sun", "entities": []}
{"text": "but keplers law would also be true actually if things were going away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in particular say electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge", "entities": []}
{"text": "so actually if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field caused by a point charged particle it also satisfies keplers law satisfies the same law", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats the end for today thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  ok so remember last time on tuesday we learned about the chain rule and so for example we saw that if we have a function that depends sorry on three variables <expression> <expression> <expression> that <expression> <expression> <expression> themselves depend on some variable <expression> then you can find a formula for <expression> by writing down <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the meaning of that formula is that while the change in <expression> is caused by changes in <expression> <expression> and <expression> <expression> <expression> and <expression> change at rates <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this causes a function to change accordingly using well the partial derivatives tell you how sensitive <expression> is to changes in each variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so we are going to just rewrite this in a new notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to rewrite this in a more concise form as gradient of <expression> dot product with velocity vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "so the gradient of <expression> is a vector formed by putting together all of the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its the vector whose components are the partials", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course its a vector that depends on <expression> <expression> and <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "these guys depend on <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its actually one vector for each point <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can talk about the gradient of <expression> at some point <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at each point it gives you a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "that actually is what we will call later a vector field", "entities": []}
{"text": "well get back to that later", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is just the velocity vector <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the new definition for today is the definition of the gradient vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and our goal will be to understand a bit better what does this vector mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does it measure", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what can we do with it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you see that in terms of information content its really the same information thats already in the partial derivatives or in the differential", "entities": []}
{"text": "so yes and i should say of course you can also use the gradient and other things like approximation formulas and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so far its just notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a way to rewrite things", "entities": []}
{"text": "but so heres the first cool property of the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim that the gradient vector is perpendicular to the level surface corresponding to setting the function <expression>  a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so if i draw a contour plot of my function so actually forget about <expression> because i want to draw a two variable contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "so say i have a function of two variables <expression> and <expression> then maybe it has some contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im saying if i take the gradient of a function at this point x y", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will have a vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i draw that vector on top of a contour plot its going to end up being perpendicular to the level curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "same thing if i have a function of three variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i can try to draw its contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "of course i cant really do it because the contour plot would be living in space with <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it would be a bunch of level faces and the gradient vector would be a vector in space", "entities": []}
{"text": "that vector is perpendicular to the level faces", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets try to see that on a couple of examples", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do a first example", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the easiest case", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets take a linear function of <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will take <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so whats the gradient of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the first component will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats partial <expression> partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then <expression> thats partial <expression> partial <expression> and <expression> partial <expression> partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what is the levels of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if i set <expression>  some constant <expression> that means i look at the points where <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 10, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "what kind of service is that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we know how to find a normal vector to this plane just by looking at the coefficients", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a plane with a normal vector exactly this gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact in a way this is the only case you need to check because of linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you replace a function by its linear approximation that means you will replace the level surfaces by their tension planes", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then youll actually end up in this situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but maybe thats not very convincing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do another example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do a second example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say we look at the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now its a function of just two variables because that way well be able to actually draw a picture for you", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what are the level sets of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theyre going to be circles right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> is a circle <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i should say maybe sorry the level curve is a circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the contour plot looks something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whats the gradient vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the gradient of this function so partial <expression> partial <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and partial <expression> partial <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i take a point <expression> and i try to draw my gradient vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here at <expression> <expression> so i have to draw the vector <expression><expression> <expression><expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what does it look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its going in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "its parallel to the position vector for this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "its actually twice the position vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess it goes more or less like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats interesting too is it is perpendicular to this circle", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its a general feature", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually let me show you more examples oops not the one i want", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i dont know if you can see it so well", "entities": []}
{"text": "well hopefully you can", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here i have a contour plot of a function and i have a blue vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the gradient vector at the pink point on the plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see i can move the pink point and the gradient vector of course changes because the gradient depends on <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what doesnt change is that its always perpendicular to the level curves", "entities": []}
{"text": "anywhere i am my gradient stays perpendicular to the level curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is that convincing", "entities": []}
{"text": "is that visible for people who cant see blue", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so ok so we have a lot of evidence but lets try to prove the theorem because it will be interesting", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first of all sorry any questions about the statement the example anything yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "ah very good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "does the gradient vector why is the gradient vector perpendicular in one direction rather than the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well see the answer to that in a few minutes", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me just tell you immediately to the side which side its pointing to its always pointing towards higher values of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and well see in that maybe about half an hour", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well let me say actually points towards higher values of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont see any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets try to prove this theorem at least this part of the theorem", "entities": []}
{"text": "were not going to prove that just yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will come in a while", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well maybe we want to understand first what happens if we move inside the level curve ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets imagine that we are taking a moving point that stays on the level curve or on the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we know well what happens is that the function stays constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we can also know how quickly the function changes using the chain rule up there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe the chain rule will actually be the key to understanding how the gradient vector and the motion on the level service relate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets take a curve <equation> that stays inside well maybe i should say on the level surface <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets think about what that means", "entities": []}
{"text": "so just to get you used to this idea im going to draw a level surface of a function of three variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its a surface given by the equation <expression>  some constant <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now im going to have a point on that and its going to move on that surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i will have some parametric curve that lives on this surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question is whats going to happen at any given time", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the first observation is that the velocity vector what can i say about the velocity vector of this motion", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going to be tangent to the level surface right", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i move on a surface then at any point my velocity is tangent to the curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if its tangent to the curve then its also tangent to the surface because the curve is inside the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ok its getting a bit cluttered", "entities": []}
{"text": "maybe i should draw a bigger picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me do that right away here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i have my level surface <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i have a curve on that and at some point im going to have a certain velocity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the claim is that the velocity <expression>  <expression> is tangent   to the level <equation> because its tangent to the curve and the curve is inside the level ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what else can we say", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we have the chain rule will tell us how the value of <expression> changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so by the chain rule we have <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rate of change of the value of <expression> as i move along this curve is given by the dot product between the gradient and the velocity vector", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so well maybe i can rewrite it as <expression> and that should be well what should it be", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "what happens to the value of <expression> as <expression> changes", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it stays constant because we are moving on a curve", "entities": []}
{"text": "that curve might be complicated but it stays always on the level <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression> because <equation> which is a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is that convincing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now if we have a dot product thats <expression> that tells us that these two guys are perpendicular", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so if the gradient vector is perpendicular to <expression> ok thats a good start", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent thats tangent to the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about other vectors tangent to the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in fact i could use any curve drawn on the level of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i could move really any way i wanted on that surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "in particular i claim that i could have chosen my velocity vector to be any vector tangent to the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets write this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is true for any curve or ill say for any motion on the level surface <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means <expression> can be any vector tangent to the surface tangent to the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "see for example ok let me draw one more picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i have my level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im drawing more and more levels and they never quite look the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i have a point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at this point i have the tangent plane to the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this is tangent plane to the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "then if i choose any vector in that tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets say i choose the one that goes in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "then i can actually find a curve that goes in that direction and stays on the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here that would be a curve that somehow goes from the right to the left and of course it has to end up going up or something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so given any vector tangent   lets call that vector <expression> tangent to the level we get that the gradient is perpendicular to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "so if the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent to this curve but also to any vector i can draw that tangent to my surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does that mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that means the gradient is actually perpendicular to the tangent plane or to the surface at this point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient is perpendicular", "entities": []}
{"text": "and well here ive illustrated things with a threedimensional example but really it works the same if you have only two variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "then you have a level curve that has a tangent line and the gradient is perpendicular to that line", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats actually pretty neat because there is a nice application of this which is to try to figure out now we know actually how to find the tangent plane to anything pretty much", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say that for example i want to find   the tangent plane   to the surface with equation lets say <equation> at the point 2 1 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well one way that we already know if we solve this for <expression> so we can write <equation> then we know tangent plane approximation for the graph of a function <expression>  some function of <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but that doesnt look like its the best way to do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the best way to it now that we have the gradient vector is actually to directly say oh we know the normal vector to this plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "the normal vector will just be the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "oh i think i have a cool picture to show", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats what it looks like", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so here you have the surface <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats called a hyperboloid because it looks like when you get when you spin a hyperbola around an axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres a tangent plane at the given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it doesnt look very tangent because it crosses the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its really if you think about it you will see its really the plane thats approximating the surface in the best way that you can at this given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is really the tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we find this plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "well you can plot it on a computer", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats not exactly how you would look for it in the first place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the way to do it is that we compute the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so a gradient of what", "entities": []}
{"text": "well a gradient of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i should say this is the level set <equation> where <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we know that the gradient of this well what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> then <expression> and then <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at this given point i guess we are at <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> and <expression> are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok and thats going to be the normal vector to the surface or to the tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one way to define the tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right it has the same normal vector as the surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one way to define the normal vector to the surface if you prefer", "entities": []}
{"text": "being perpendicular to the surface means that you are perpendicular to its tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the equation is well <expression>  something where something is well we should just plug in that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "well get <expression> looks like well get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course we could simplify dividing everything by two but its not very important here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now if you have a surface given by an evil equation and a point on the surface well you know how to find the tangent plane to the surface at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok let me give just another reason why another way that we could have seen this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i claim in fact we could have done this without the gradient or using the gradient in a somehow disguised way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so heres another way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the other way to do it would be to start with a differential ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> while its pretty much the same content but let me write it as a differential <expression> is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 68}]}
{"text": "so at a given point at 2 1 1 this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if we want to change this into an approximation formula we can", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know that the change in <expression> is approximately  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so when do we stay on the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we stay on the level surface when <expression> doesnt change so when this becomes <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what does this approximation sign mean", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it means for small changes in <expression> <expression> <expression> this guy will be close to that guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "it also means something else", "entities": []}
{"text": "remember these approximation formulas they are linear approximations", "entities": []}
{"text": "they mean that we replace the function actually by some closest linear formula that will be nearby", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so in particular if we set this  <expression> instead of approximately <expression> it means well actually be moving on the tangent plane to the level set", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 49}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 87}]}
{"text": "if you want strict equalities in approximations means that we replace the function by its tangent approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  applause ok so the level corresponds to <equation> and its tangent plane corresponds to <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what im trying to say basically", "entities": []}
{"text": "and whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that means its the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats the change in <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means well we started with <equation> and we moved to some other value <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats actually <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats how much <expression> has changed compared to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the equation of a tangent plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the same equation as the one over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are just two different methods to get it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this one explains to you whats going on in terms of approximation formulas", "entities": []}
{"text": "this one goes right away by using the gradient factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in a way with this one you dont have to think nearly as much", "entities": []}
{"text": "but you can use either one", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets move on to new topic which is another application of a gradient vector and that is directional derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets say that we have a function of two variables <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we know how to compute partial <expression> or <expression> which measure how <expression> changes if i move in the direction of the x axis or in the direction of the y axis", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "so what about moving in other directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "well of course weve seen other approximation formulas and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "but we can still ask is there a derivative in every direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats basically yes thats the directional derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so these are derivatives in the direction of i hat or j hat the vectors that go along the x or the y axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what if we move in another direction lets say the direction of some unit vector lets call it u", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 88, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "ok so if i give you a unit vector you can ask yourself if i move in the direction how quickly will my function change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  so lets look at the straight trajectory", "entities": []}
{"text": "what this should mean is i start at some value <expression> <expression> and there i have my vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35}]}
{"text": "and im going to move in a straight line in the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i have the graph of my function   and im asking myself how quickly does the value change when i move on the graph in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets look at a straight line trajectory so we have a position vector <expression> that will depend on some parameter which i will call <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 136, "end_offset": 140}]}
{"text": "youll see why very soon in such a way that the derivative is this given unit vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so why do i use s for my parameter rather than <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its a convention", "entities": []}
{"text": "im moving at unit speed along this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that actually im parameterizing things by the distance that ive traveled along a curve sorry along this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here its called s in the sense of arc length", "entities": []}
{"text": "actually its not really an arc because its a straight line so its the distance along the line", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so because we are parameterizing by distance we are just using s as a convention just to distinguish it from other situations", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now the question will be what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the rate of change of w when i move like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well of course we know the answer because thats a special case of the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 80}]}
{"text": "so thats how we will actually compute it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "but in terms of what it means it really means we are asking ourselves we start at a point and we change the variables in a certain direction which is not necessarily the x or the y direction but really any direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then whats the derivative in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok does that make sense as a concept", "entities": []}
{"text": "kind of", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see some faces that are not completely convinced", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe you should show more pictures", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me first write down a bit more and show you something", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i just want to give you the actual definition", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry first of all in case you wonder what this is all about so lets say the components of our unit vector are two numbers <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it means well move along the line <expression>  some initial value the point where we are actually at the directional derivative <expression> or i meant to say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we plug that into <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we take the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have a notation for that which is going to be <expression> with a subscript in the direction of u to indicate in which direction we are actually going to move", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats called the directional derivative   in the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see what it means geometrically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember weve seen things about partial derivatives and we see that the partial derivatives are the slopes of slices of the graph by vertical planes that are parallel to the x or the y directions", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so if i have a point at any point i can slice the graph of my function by two planes one thats going along the x one along the y direction", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 43, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "and then i can look at the slices of the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me see if i can use that thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we can look at the slices of the graph that are drawn here", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact we look at the tangent lines to the slices and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now similarly the directional derivative means actually well be slicing our graph by the vertical plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "its not really colorful something more colorful", "entities": []}
{"text": "well be slicing things by a plane that is now in the direction of this vector <expression> and well be looking at the slope of the slice of the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what that looks like here so thats the same applet the way that youve used on your problem set in case you are wondering", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im picking a point on the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "and at that point i slice the graph", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here im starting by slicing in the direction of the x axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact what im measuring here by the slope of the slice is the partial in the x direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "its really <expression> which is also the directional derivative in the direction of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i rotate the slice then i have all of these planes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you see at the bottom left i have the direction in which im going", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres this like rotating line that tells you in which direction im going to be moving", "entities": []}
{"text": "and for each direction i have a plane", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i slice by that plane i will get so i have this direction here going maybe to the southwest", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that gives me a slice of my graph by a vertical plane and the slice has a certain slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok i think thats as graphic as i can get", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok any questions about that", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see how we compute that guy", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just write again just in case you want to in case you didnt hear me its the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane   that contains the given direction thats parallel to the direction u", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how do we compute it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can use the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "the chain rule implies that <expression> is actually the gradient of w dot product with the velocity vector <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "but remember we say that we are going to be moving at unit speed in the direction of u", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact thats just gradient <expression> dot product with the unit vector <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the formula that we remember is really <expression> in the direction of u is gradient <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe i should also say in words this is the component of the gradient in the direction of u", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe that makes more sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example the directional derivative in the direction of i hat is the component along the x axes", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same as indeed the partial derivatives in the x direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "things make sense", "entities": []}
{"text": "dwds in the direction of i hat is sorry gradient <expression> which is <expression> maybe i should write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok now so thats basically what we need to know to compute these guys", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now lets go back to the gradient and see what this tells us about the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "applause i see you guys are having fun", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok ok lets do a little bit of geometry here", "entities": []}
{"text": "that should calm you down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said <expression> in the direction of <expression> is gradient <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the same as the length of gradient <expression> times the length of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well that happens to be one because we are taking the unit vector times the cosine of the angle between the gradient and the given unit vector <expression> so have this angle theta", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats another way of saying we are taking the component of a gradient in the direction of u", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now what does that tell us", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets try to figure out in which directions w changes the fastest in which direction it increases the most or decreases the most or doesnt actually change", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when is this going to be the largest", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i fix a point if i set a point then the gradient vector at that point is given to me", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the question is in which direction does it change the most quickly", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what i can change is the direction and this will be the largest when the cosine is one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is largest when the <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means the angle is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means u is actually in the direction of the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats a new way to think about the direction of a gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "the gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the direction of gradient <expression> is the direction of fastest increase of <expression> at the given point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is the magnitude of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well its actually the directional derivative in that direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so if i go in that direction which gives me the fastest increase then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and with the direction of the fastest decrease", "entities": []}
{"text": "its going in the opposite direction right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean if you are on a mountain and you know that you are facing the mountain thats the direction of fastest increase", "entities": []}
{"text": "the direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so the minimal value of <expression> is achieved when <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <expression> is in the direction of minus the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "it points opposite to the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "and finally when do we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in which direction does the function not change", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we have two answers to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is to just use the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that means that <expression> is perpendicular to the gradient", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other way to think about it the direction in which the value doesnt change is a direction thats tangent to the level surface", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we are not changing a it means we are moving along the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the same thing   as being tangent to the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me just show that on the picture here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if actually show you the gradient you cant really see it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i need to move it a bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that i have chosen", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i choose a slice thats perpendicular and a direction thats perpendicular to the gradient so thats actually tangent to the level curve then you see that my slice is flat", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont actually have any slop", "entities": []}
{"text": "the directional derivative in a direction thats perpendicular to the gradient is basically <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now if i rotate then the slope sort of increases increases increases and it becomes the largest when im going in the direction of a gradient", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "so here i have actually a pretty big slope", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now if i keep rotating then the slope will decrease again", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it becomes <expression> when i perpendicular and then it becomes negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the most negative when i pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <expression> again when im back perpendicular", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so for example if i give you a contour plot and i ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector well at this point for example you would look at the picture", "entities": []}
{"text": "the gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it would be going towards higher values of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont know if you can see the labels but the thing in the middle is a minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats it for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so today we are going to continue looking at critical points and well learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum maximum or a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the main topic for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so remember yesterday we looked at critical points of functions of several variables", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so a critical point functions we have two values <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a point where the partial derivatives are both <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and weve seen that theres various kinds of critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres local minima", "entities": []}
{"text": "so maybe i should show the function on this contour plot there is local maxima which are like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima", "entities": []}
{"text": "and of course if you have a real function then it would be more complicated", "entities": []}
{"text": "it will have several critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this example here well you see on the plot that there is two maxima", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there is in the middle between them a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and actually you can see them on the contour plot", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the contour plot you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight", "entities": []}
{"text": "it crosses itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if you move up or down here so along the y direction the values of the function will decrease", "entities": []}
{"text": "along the x direction the values will increase", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you can see usually quite easily where are the critical points just by looking either at the graph or at the contour plots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "just of course in one case the values increase and in another one they decrease", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the question   is how do we decide   between the various possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "so local minimum local maximum or saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so and in fact why do we care", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the other question is how do we find the global minimummaximum of a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here what i should point out well first of all to decide where the function is the largest in general youll have actually to compare the values", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example here if you want to know what is the maximum of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we have two obvious candidates", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have this local maximum and that local maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the question is which one is the higher of the two", "entities": []}
{"text": "well in this case actually there is actually a tie for maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general you would have to compute the function at both points and compare the values if you know that its three at one of them and four at the other", "entities": []}
{"text": "well four wins", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function well the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points", "entities": []}
{"text": "so wheres the minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats another feature", "entities": []}
{"text": "the global minimum or maximum doesnt have to be at a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could also be somehow on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where actually the minimum and maximum will be", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in general i should point out these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so by that i mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we have to try both", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok but so well get back to that", "entities": []}
{"text": "for now lets try to focus on the question of you know whats the type of the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well use something thats known as the second derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in principle well the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable namely the function of one variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "if the derivative is zero then you know that you should look at the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that will tell you whether its curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the main problem here is of course we have more possible situations and we have several derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have to think a bit harder about how well decide", "entities": []}
{"text": "but it will again involve the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function thats actually just quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets say i have a function <expression> thats of the form <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <expression> well and if you plug <equation> youll get <expression> and same with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 65, "end_offset": 69}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 74, "end_offset": 84}]}
{"text": "you can also see if you try to do a linear approximation of this well all these guys are much smaller than <expression> and <expression> when <expression> and <expression> are small", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the linear approximation the tangent plane to the graph is really just <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so how do we do it", "entities": []}
{"text": "well yesterday we actually did an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "it was a bit more complicated than that but let me do it so remember we were looking at something that started with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there were other terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets forget them now", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what we did is we said well we can rewrite this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this is a sum of two squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "so each of these guys has to be nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so the origin will be a minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it turns out we can do something similar in general no matter what the values of <expression> <expression> and <expression> are", "entities": []}
{"text": "well just try to first complete things to a square", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in general well let me be slightly less general and let me assume that a is not zero because otherwise i cant do what im going to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to write this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i have my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now this looks like the beginning of the square of something ok just like what we did over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what is it the square of", "entities": []}
{"text": "well youd start with <expression> plus i claim if i put <expression> and i square it then see the cross term <expression> will become <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 55}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 75, "end_offset": 81}]}
{"text": "of course now i also get some y squares out of this", "entities": []}
{"text": "how many y squares do i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so and i want in fact <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the number of <expression> that i should add is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 47}]}
{"text": "ok lets see that again", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i expand this thing i will get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats going to be my <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i also get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that cancels out with this guy here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i will be left with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok do you see it kind of", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok if not well try expanding this square again", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok maybe ill do it just to convince you", "entities": []}
{"text": "but so if i expand this i will get a times let me put that in a different color because you shouldnt write that down", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just to convince you again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you dont see it yet lets expend this thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "well get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the two as cancel out", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get <expression> the square of thats going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here the a and the a simplifies and now these two terms simplify and give me just <expression> in the end", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 56, "end_offset": 64}]}
{"text": "ok and thats kind of unreadable after ive canceled everything but if you follow it you see that basically ive just rewritten my initial function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is that kind of ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean otherwise theres just no substitute", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll have to do it yourself im afraid", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me continue to play with this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just going to put this in a slightly different form just to clear the denominators", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i will instead write this as <expression> times the big thing", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 26}]}
{"text": "so im going to just put <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so far i have the same thing as here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just introduced the <expression> that cancels out plus for the other one im just clearing the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "i end up with <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats a lot of terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what does it look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "well it looks like so we have some constant factors and here we have a square and here we have a square", "entities": []}
{"text": "so basically weve written this as a sum of two squares well a sum or a difference of two squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "and maybe thats what we need to figure out to know what kind of point it is because see if you take a sum of two squares that you will know that each square takes nonnegative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you will have the function will always take nonnegative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the origin will be a minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if you have a difference of two squares that typically youll have a saddle point because depending on whether one or the other is larger you will have a positive or a negative quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i claim theres various cases to look at", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in fact i claim there will be three cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats good news for us because after all we want to distinguish between three possibilities", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets first do away with the most complicated one", "entities": []}
{"text": "what if <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if its negative then it means what i have between the brackets is so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity while the second one will be something negative times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it will be a negative quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so one term is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "the other is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "that tells us we actually have a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we have in fact written our function as a difference of two squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is that convincing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you want what i could do is actually i could change my coordinates have new coordinates called <equation> actually well i could keep y and that it would look like the difference of squares directly", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats the first case", "entities": []}
{"text": "the second case is where <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well what happens if thats zero", "entities": []}
{"text": "then it means that this term over there goes away", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what we have is just one square", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "in the other direction its going to actually be degenerate", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for example forget all the clutter in there", "entities": []}
{"text": "say i give you just the function of two variables <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means it doesnt depend on <expression> at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if i try to plot the graph it will look like well <expression> is here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 20}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "so it will depend on <expression> in that way but it doesnt depend on <expression> at all", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what the graph looks like is something like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok basically its a valley whose bottom is completely flat", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means actually we have a degenerate critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called degenerate because there is a direction in which nothing happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact you have critical points everywhere along the y axis", "entities": []}
{"text": "now whether the square that we have is <expression> or something else namely <expression> it doesnt matter", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean it will still get this degenerate behavior", "entities": []}
{"text": "but theres a direction in which nothing happens because we just have the square of one quantity", "entities": []}
{"text": "im sure that <expression> students means <expression> different ring tones but im not eager to hear all of them thanks", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter ok so this is whats called a degenerate critical point and laughter", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so basically well leave it here", "entities": []}
{"text": "we wont actually try to figure out further what happens and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function a general function not just one thats quadratic like this then there will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers maybe <expression> or <expression> or things like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then they will mess up what happens in this valley", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its a situation where we wont be able actually to tell automatically just by looking at second derivatives what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "see for example in a function of one variable if you have just a function of one variable say <expression> well if you try to decide what type of point the origin is youre going to take the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "it will be <expression> and then you can conclude", "entities": []}
{"text": "those things depend on higher order derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we just wont like that case", "entities": []}
{"text": "we just wont try to figure out whats going on here", "entities": []}
{"text": "now the last situation is if <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so then that means that actually weve written things", "entities": []}
{"text": "the big bracket up there is a sum of two squares", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that weve written <expression> as <expression> plus something squared plus something else squared ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these guys have the same sign and that means that this term here will always be greater than or  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means that we should either have a maximum or minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "how we find out which one it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we look at the sign of a exactly", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres two subcases", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is if a is positive then this quantity overall will always be nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means we have a minimum ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if a is negative on the other hand so that means that we multiply this positive quantity by a negative number we get something thats always negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is actually the maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok is that clear for everyone", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry yeah so i said in the example <equation> it doesnt depend on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the more general situation is <expression>  some constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i guess its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it does depend on <expression> and <expression> but it only depends on this combination", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so if i choose to move in some other perpendicular direction in the direction where this remains constant so maybe if i set <equation> then this remains zero all the time", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 123, "end_offset": 126}]}
{"text": "so theres a degenerate direction in which i stay at the minimum or maximum or whatever it is that i have", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats why its called degenerate", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is a direction in which nothing happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes yeah so thats a very good question", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres going to be the second derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "why do not have derivatives yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats because ive been looking at this special example where we have a function like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i dont actually need to take derivatives yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "but secretly thats because <expression> <expression> and <expression> will be the second derivatives of the function actually <expression> <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now we are going to go to general function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and there instead of having these coefficients <expression> <expression> and  given to us well have to compute them as second derivatives", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 110}]}
{"text": "ok so here im basically setting the stage for what will be the actual criterion well use using second derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "so yeah so what you have a degenerate critical point it could be a degenerate minimum or a degenerate maximum depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in general once you start having functions you dont really know what will happen anymore", "entities": []}
{"text": "it could also be a degenerate saddle and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we wont really be able to tell", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "it is possible to have a degenerate saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example if i gave you <expression> you can convince yourself that if you take <expression> and <expression> to be negative it will be negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <expression> and <expression> are positive its positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats a degenerate saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont see it here because that doesnt happen if you have only quadratic terms like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "you need to have higherorder terms to see it happen", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets continue", "entities": []}
{"text": "before we continue but see i wanted to point out one small thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "so here we have the magic quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve probably seen that before in your life", "entities": []}
{"text": "yet it looks like the quadratic formula except that one involves <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats really the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see where does the quadratic formula come in here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well let me write things differently", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so weve manipulated things and got into a conclusion", "entities": []}
{"text": "but let me just do a different manipulation and write this now instead as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok see thats the same thing that i had before", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so now this quantity here is always nonnegative", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "well of course this one depends on <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it means it depends on which direction youre going to move away from the origin which ratio between <expression> and <expression> you will consider", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i claim theres two situations", "entities": []}
{"text": "one is so lets try to reformulate things", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if a discriminate here is positive then it means that these have roots and these have solutions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "this quantity takes positive and negative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "one way to convince yourself is just to you know plot <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53}]}
{"text": "you know that theres two roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "so it might look like this or might look like that depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in either case it will take values of both signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that means that your function will take values of both signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value takes both positive and negative values", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that means we have a saddle point while the other situation when <expression> is negative   means that this equation is quadratic never takes the value <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its always positive or its always negative depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the other case is if <expression> is negative then the quadratic doesnt have a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it could look like this or like that depending on whether <expression> is positive or <expression> is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in particular that means that <expression> is always positive or always negative depending on the sign of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then that tells us that our function  will be always positive or always negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then well get a minimum or maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok well have a min or a max depending on which situation we are in", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats another way to derive the same answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you see here why the discriminate plays a role", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign or whether it can actually cross the value <expression> when you have the root of a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations at least", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you are willing to believe i hope that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now what do we do with the general function", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so in general we want to look at second derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now we are getting to the real stuff", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how many second derivatives do we have", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats maybe the first thing we should figure out", "entities": []}
{"text": "well we can take the derivative first with respect to <expression> and then again with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "ok that gives us something we denote by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "then theres another one which is <expression> which means you take the derivative with respect to <expression> and then with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "another thing you can do is do first derivative respect to <expression> and then with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that would be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well good news", "entities": []}
{"text": "these are actually always  to each other", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so its the fact that we will admit its actually not very hard to check", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are always the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont need to worry about which one we do", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats one computation that we wont need to do", "entities": []}
{"text": "we can save a bit of effort", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then we have the last one namely the second partial with respect to <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so we have three of them", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what does the second derivative test say", "entities": []}
{"text": "it says say that you have a critical point x0 y0 of a function of two variables <expression> and then lets compute the partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets call capital a the second derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets call capital b the second derivative with respect to <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <equation> at this point ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative and then we plug in the values of <expression> and <expression> at the critical point", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 85, "end_offset": 92}]}
{"text": "so these will just be numbers", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now what we do is we look at the quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i am not forgetting the four", "entities": []}
{"text": "you will see why there isnt one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if <expression> is positive then theres two subcases", "entities": []}
{"text": "if a is positive then its local minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "the second case so still if <expression> is positive but <expression> is negative then its going to be a local maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and if <expression> is negative then its a saddle point and finally if <expression> is <expression> then we actually cannot compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "we dont know whether its going to be a minimum a maximum or a saddle", "entities": []}
{"text": "we know its degenerate in some way but we dont know what type of point it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so thats actually what you need to remember", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you are formula oriented thats all you need to remember about today", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets try to understand why how this comes out of what we had there", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so i think maybe i actually want to keep so maybe i want to keep this middle board because it actually has you know the recipe that we found before the quadratic function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with the new", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok you are easily amused", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so first lets check that these two things say the same thing in the special case that we are looking at", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets verify in the special case where the function was <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  well what is the second derivative with respect to <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if i take the second derivative with respect to <expression> and <expression> so first i want to take maybe the derivative with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 9}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 31}]}
{"text": "but first lets take the first partial <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that will be <expression> by right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> will be well lets take a partial with respect to <expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "wxy i take the partial respect to <expression> and well get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "ok now we need also the partial with respect to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in case you dont believe what i told you about the mixed partials <expression> well you can check", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its again <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they are indeed the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if we now look at these quantities that tells us well <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression> <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is what we used to call <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok ooh", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter so now you can compare the cases", "entities": []}
{"text": "they are not listed in the same order just to make it harder", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we said first so the saddle case is when <expression> in big letters is negative thats the same as <expression> in lower case is negative", "entities": []}
{"text": "the case where capital <expression> is positive local min and local max corresponds to this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the case where we cant conclude was what used to be the degenerate one", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so at least we dont seem to have messed up when copying the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "now why does that work more generally than that", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the answer that is again taylor approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "aww", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so let me just do here quadratic approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so quadratic approximation tells me the following thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "it tells me if i have a function <expression> and i want to understand the change in <expression> when i change <expression> and <expression> a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "well theres the firstorder terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "there is the linear terms that by now you should know and be comfortable with", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression> times the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then theres <expression> times the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok thats the starting point", "entities": []}
{"text": "but now of course if <expression> and <expression> sorry if we are at the critical point then thats going to be <expression> at the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that term actually goes away and thats also zero at the critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that term also goes away", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so linear approximation is really no good", "entities": []}
{"text": "we need more terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what are the next terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the next terms are quadratic terms and so i mean if you remember the taylor formula for a function of a single variable there was the derivative times <expression> of a second derivative times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and see this side here is really taylor approximation in one variable looking only at <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but of course we also have terms involving <expression> and terms involving simultaneously <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and these terms are <expression> times change in <expression> times change in <expression> plus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres no one half in the middle because in fact you would have two terms one for <expression> one for <expression> but they are the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if you want to continue there is actually cubic terms involving the third derivatives and so on but we are not actually looking at them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so now when we do this approximation well the type of critical point remains the same when we replace the function by this approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we can apply the argument that we used to deduce things in the quadratic case", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact it still works in the general case using this approximation formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "so  the general case reduces to the quadratic case", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now you see actually why well here you see again how this coefficient which we used to call little a is also <expression> of capital a", "entities": []}
{"text": "and same here this coefficient is what we call capital b or little b and this coefficient here is what we called little c or <expression> of capital c", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 113, "end_offset": 121}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 150}]}
{"text": "and then when you replace these into the various cases that we had here you end up with the second derivative test", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what about the degenerate case", "entities": []}
{"text": "why cant we just say well its going to be a degenerate critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in fact secretly theres more terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is only an approximation", "entities": []}
{"text": "there would be terms involving third derivatives and maybe even beyond that", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so it is not to generate case they dont actually matter because the shape of the function the shape of the graph is actually determined by the quadratic terms", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in the degenerate case see if i start with this and i add something even very very small along the y axis then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down and turn my degenerate point in to either a minimum or a saddle point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i wont be able to tell until i go further in the list of derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in the degenerate case what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we will need to analyze things more carefully", "entities": []}
{"text": "well were not going to bother with that in this class", "entities": []}
{"text": "so well just say well we cannot compute ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "i mean you have to realize that in real life you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter well if that happens then what you should do is maybe try by inspection", "entities": []}
{"text": "see if theres a good reason why the function should always be positive or always be negative or something", "entities": []}
{"text": "or you know plot it on a computer and see what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "but otherwise we cant compute", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets do an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so probably i should leave this on so that we still have the test with us", "entities": []}
{"text": "and instead ok so ill do my example here", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so just an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets look at <equation> where <expression> and <expression> are positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im looking only at the first quadrant", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok i mean im doing this because i dont want the denominator to become <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im just looking at the situation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets look first for so the question will be what are the minimum and maximum of this function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first thing we should do to answer this question is look for critical points ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for that we have to compute the first derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so <expression> is <expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "take the derivative of <expression> thats <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "and well want to set that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we want to set that  to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so what are the equations we have to solve", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i guess <equation> i mean if i move this guy over here i get <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <equation> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do you get by comparing these two", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> and <expression> should both be ok so yeah i agree with you that one and one is a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "why is it the only one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so first if i divide this one by that one i get <equation>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "so it tells me <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then if <equation> then if i put that into here it will give me <equation> which tells me <equation> and therefore <equation> as well", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "ok so theres only one solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres only one critical point which is going to be 1 1", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so now heres where you do a bit of work", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do you think of that critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok i see some valid votes", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see some ok i see a lot of people answering four", "entities": []}
{"text": "laughter that seems to suggest that maybe you havent completed the second derivative yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "yes i see someone giving the correct answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see some people not giving quite the correct answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see more and more correct answers", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "to figure out what type of point is we should compute the second partial derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is what do we get what we take the derivative of this with respect to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 46}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 47, "end_offset": 61}]}
{"text": "<expression> ok", "entities": []}
{"text": "so at our point <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is going to be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> will be <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so that tells us well <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry i should probably use a different blackboard for that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "that tells us we are either a local minimum or local maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is positive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its a local minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact you can check its the global minimum", "entities": []}
{"text": "what about the maximum", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if a maximum is not actually at a critical point its on the boundary or at infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "see so we have actually to check what happens when <expression> and <expression> go to <expression> or to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "well if that happens if <expression> or <expression> goes to infinity then the function goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "also if <expression> or <expression> goes to <expression> then <expression> goes to infinity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the maximum well the function goes to infinity when <expression> goes to infinity or <expression> goes to infinity or <expression> and <expression> go to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its not at a critical point", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok so in general we have to check both the critical points and the boundaries to decide what happens", "entities": []}
{"text": "ok the end", "entities": []}
{"text": "have a nice weekend", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets solve another 2nd order linear homogeneous differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this one well i wont give you the details before i actually write it down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the differential equation is <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have our initial conditions <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we have <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i could go into the whole thing <equation> is a solution substitute it in then factor out <expression> and have the characteristic equation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 93}]}
{"text": "and if you want to see all of that over again you might want to watch the previous video just to see where that characteristic equation comes from", "entities": []}
{"text": "but in this video im just going to show you literally how quickly you can do these type of problems mechanically", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if this is our original differential equation the characteristic equation is going to be and ill do this in a different color <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and watch the previous video if you dont know where this characteristic equation comes from", "entities": []}
{"text": "but if you want to do these problems really quick you just substitute the 2nd derivatives with an <expression> the first derivatives with an <expression> and then the function with oh sorry no", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is supposed to be a constant and then the coefficient on the original function is just a constant right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you see what i did", "entities": []}
{"text": "2nd derivative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "1st derivative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "no derivative you could say thats <expression> or just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but this is our characteristic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can just figure out its roots", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is not a trivial one for me to factor so if its not trivial you can just use the quadratic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we could say the solution of this is <equation> <expression> is <expression> so its <expression> <expression> plus or minus <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats <expression> which is <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  <expression> minus whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all of that over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see its <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression> then another so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have <equation>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the two solutions of this characteristic equation ignore that let me scratch that out in black so you know thats not like a <expression> or something the two solutions of this characteristic equation are <expression>  well <equation> and <equation>  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know our two rs and we know that from previous experience in the last video that <equation> is a solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the general solution of this differential equation is <equation> lets use our first <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this differential equations problem was literally just a problem in using the quadratic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and once you figure out the rs you have your general solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we just have to use our initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to know the initial conditions we need to know <expression> and we need to know <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just do that right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> of our general solution  <expression> plus derivative of the inside <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets use our actual initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont want to lose them let me rewrite them down here so i can scroll down", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we know that <expression> is  to <expression> and <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "those are our initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets use that information", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> what happens when you substitute <equation> here", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "you get <expression> essentially so thats just <expression> well thats just <expression> again because <expression> is <expression>  so this is when <equation> what is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then lets use the second equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when we substitute <expression> is  to <expression> in the derivative so when <expression> is <expression> we get <expression> this goes to <expression> again plus <expression> this is <expression> again <expression> which is <expression> is  to so when <expression> is <expression> for the derivative <equation> or the derivative is <expression> at that point or the slope is <expression> at that point", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "and now we have two equations and two unknowns and we could solve it a ton of ways", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you know how to solve them", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets multiply the top equation i dont know lets multiply it by <expression> and what do we get", "entities": []}
{"text": "we get ill do it in a different color we get <expression>  whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now lets subtract well i dont want to confuse you so lets just subtract the bottom from the top so this cancels out", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats just minus <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression>  whats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression> or <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so we get <expression> is  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we can substitute back in this top equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> or <equation> which is the same thing as <expression> which  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can just substitute <expression> and <expression> back into our general solution and we have found the particular solution of this differential equation which is <equation> <expression> is <expression> is <expression> which is <expression> and we are done", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "and it might seem really fancy", "entities": []}
{"text": "were solving a differential equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "our solution has <expression> in it", "entities": []}
{"text": "were taking derivatives and were doing all sorts of things", "entities": []}
{"text": "but really the meat of this problem was solving a quadratic which was our characteristic equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "and watch the previous video just to see why this characteristic equation works", "entities": []}
{"text": "but its very easy to come up with the characteristic equation right", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think you obviously see that <expression> turns into <expression> <expression> turns into <expression> and then <expression> just turns into <expression> essentially", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you solve a quadratic", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then after doing that you just have to take one derivative because after solving the quadratic you immediately have the general solution then you take its derivative use your initial conditions", "entities": []}
{"text": "you have a system of linear equations which is algebra i", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you solve them for the two constants c1 and c2 and you end up with your particular solution", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats all there is to it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i will see you in the next video", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor i am haynes miller i am substituting for david jerison today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have a substitute teacher today", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i havent been here in this class with you so im not completely sure where you are", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think youve just been talking about differentiation and youve got some examples of differentiation like these basic examples the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but i think maybe youve spent some time computing the derivative of the sine function as well recently", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i think you have some rules for extending these calculations as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "for instance i think you know that if you differentiate a constant times a function what do you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor the constant comes outside like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i could write <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats this rule multiplying by a constant and i think you also know about differentiating a sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i could write this as <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im going to be using those but today ill talk about a collection of other rules about how to deal with a product of functions a quotient of functions and best of all composition of functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then at the end ill have something to say about higher derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats the story for today", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the program", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets begin by talking about the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the product rule tells you how to differentiate a product of functions and ill just give you the rule first of all", "entities": []}
{"text": "the rule is its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its a little bit funny", "entities": []}
{"text": "differentiating a product gives you a sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "but lets see how that works out in a particular example", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example suppose that i wanted to differentiate the product", "entities": []}
{"text": "well the product of these two basic examples that we just talked about", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to use the same variable in both cases instead of different ones like i did here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a new thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "we couldnt do this without using the product rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the first function is <expression> and the second one is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and were going to apply this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is according to the rule <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i take <expression> and write it down the way it is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 15}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 38}]}
{"text": "and then i do it the other way", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take <expression> the way it is thats <expression> and multiply it by the derivative of <expression> <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 6}]}
{"text": "we just saw <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "obviously you can differentiate longer products products of more things by doing it one at a time", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see why this is true", "entities": []}
{"text": "i want to try to show you why the product rule holds", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you have a standard way of trying to understand this and it involves looking at the change in the function that youre interested in differentiating", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i should look at how much the product <expression> changes when <expression> changes a little bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "well so how do compute the change", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "well i write down the value of the function at some new value of <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i better write down the whole new value of the function and the function is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the whole new value looks like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the new value", "entities": []}
{"text": "but whats the change in the product", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i better subtract off what the old value was which is <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 22}]}
{"text": "okay according to the rule were trying to prove i have to get <expression> involved", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i want to involve the change in <expression> alone by itself", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets just try that", "entities": []}
{"text": "i see part of the formula for the change in <expression> right there", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see if we can get the rest of it in place", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the change in <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the change in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this part of it occurs up here multiplied by <expression> so lets put that in too", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this equality sign isnt very good right now", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive got this product here so far but ive introduced something i dont like", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive introduced <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "minus that", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the next thing im gonna do is correct that little defect by adding in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay now i cancelled off what was wrong with this line", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im still not quite there because i havent put this in yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i better subtract off <expression> and then ill be home", "entities": []}
{"text": "but im going to do that in a clever way because i noticed that i already have a <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna take this factor of <expression> and make it the same as this factor", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 12, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so i get <expression> times this <expression> times that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "thats the same thing as <expression> times the difference", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 36}]}
{"text": "so that was a little bit strange but when you stand back and look at it you can see multiplied out the middle terms cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "and you get the right answer", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i like that because its involved the change in <expression> and the change in <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 52, "end_offset": 64}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 95}]}
{"text": "so this  <expression> times the change in <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 21}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 54}]}
{"text": "well im almost there", "entities": []}
{"text": "the next step in computing the derivative is take difference quotient divide this by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is well ill say <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "have i made a mistake here", "entities": []}
{"text": "this plus magically became a minus on the way down here so i better fix that", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this <expression> is this <expression> over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive just divided this formula by <expression> and now i can take the limit as <expression> goes to <expression> so this is as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this becomes the definition of the derivative and on this side i get <expression> times", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what happens to this quantity when <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this quantity is getting closer and closer to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what happens to the value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it becomes  <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "that uses continuity of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> goes to <expression> by continuity", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this gives me times <expression> and then i have <expression> times and <expression> gives me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats the formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the formula as i wrote it down at the beginning over here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of a product is given by this sum", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student how did you get from the first line to the second of the long equation", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor from here to here", "entities": []}
{"text": "student yes", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor so maybe its easiest to work backwards and verify that what i wrote down is correct here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so if you look theres a <expression> there", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres also one here", "entities": []}
{"text": "and they occur with opposite signs", "entities": []}
{"text": "so they cancel", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats left is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats just what i started with", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible they cancel right", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor i cancelled out this term and this term and whats left is the ends", "entities": []}
{"text": "any other questions", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor well i just calculated what delta uv is and now im gonna divide that by <expression> on my way to computing the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so i copied down the right hand side and divided <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i just decided to divide the <expression> by <expression> and <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 24}]}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "so we have the product rule here", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "the rule for differentiating a product of two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is making us stronger", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are many more functions you can find derivatives of now", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about quotients", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets find out how to differentiate a quotient of two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "well again ill write down what the answer is and then well try to verify it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres a quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me write this down", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres a quotient of two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the rule for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i always have to think about this and hope that i get it right", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this may be the craziest rule youll see in this course but there it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "and ill try to show you why thats true and see an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah there was a hand", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible professor what letters look the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "u and v look the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill try to make them look more different", "entities": []}
{"text": "the vs have points on the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "us have little round things on the bottom", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the new value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "the value of <expression> at <expression> is <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the change in <expression> when <expression> gets replaced by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the change in <expression> the new value <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is the new value of <expression> divided by the new value of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the beginning", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i subtract off the old values which are <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thisll be easier to work out when i write it out this way", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now well cross multiply as i said", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression> now i cross multiply this way you get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 28, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "and i divide all this by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "okay now the reason i like to do it this way is that you see the cancellation happening here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> and <expression> occur twice and so i can cancel them", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i will and ill answer these questions in a minute", "entities": []}
{"text": "audience inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor ooh thats a <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "good anything else", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what all hands were", "entities": []}
{"text": "good", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right so i cancel these and what im left with then is <expression> and all this is over <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay theres the difference", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the change in the quotient", "entities": []}
{"text": "the change in this function is given by this formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now to compute the derivative i want to divide by <expression> and take the limit", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 23, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so lets write that down <expression> is this formula here divided by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and again im going to put the <expression> under these <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "im gonna put <expression> in the denominator but i can think of that as dividing into this factor and this factor", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 12}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 44}]}
{"text": "so this is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all that is divided by the same denominator <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "right", "entities": []}
{"text": "put the <expression> up in the numerator there", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 3}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 31, "end_offset": 40}]}
{"text": "next up take the limit as <expression> goes to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "i get by definition the derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 5}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 34}]}
{"text": "and on the right hand side well this is the derivative <expression> right", "entities": []}
{"text": "times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "see and then <expression> times and here its the derivative <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now what about the denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when <expression> goes to <expression> <expression> stays the same <expression> stays the same", "entities": []}
{"text": "what happens to this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it goes to <expression> again because <expression> is continuous", "entities": []}
{"text": "so again <expression> goes to <expression> with <expression> because theyre continuous and you just get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think thats the formula i wrote down over there", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and all divided by the square of the old denominator", "entities": []}
{"text": "well thats it", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the quotient rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "weird formula", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see an application", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the example im going to give is pretty simple", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take the numerator to be just <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im gonna take <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now im differentiating <expression> the reciprocal of a function <expression> over a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "heres a copy of my rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats <expression> in that case", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a constant so that term is <expression> in this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "i dont have to worry about this", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get a minus", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> is <expression> and <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well <expression> is whatever <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill write <expression> as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i get a <expression> in the denominator", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 37, "end_offset": 48}]}
{"text": "so thats the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could write it as <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about subexample of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "im going to take the special case where <equation> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is a power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im gonna use the rule that we developed earlier about the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so what do i get here", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is im plugging into this formula here with <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get minus uh <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "if <equation> <expression> is by the rule of exponents <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then <expression> is the derivative of <expression> which is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so lets put these together", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres several powers of <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can put them together", "entities": []}
{"text": "i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "one of these ns cancels", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what im left with is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so weve computed the derivative of <expression> which i could also write as <expression> right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 67, "end_offset": 72}]}
{"text": "so ive computed the derivative of negative powers of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and this is the formula that i get", "entities": []}
{"text": "if you think of this <expression> as a unit as a thing to itself it occurs here in the exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "it occurs here and it occurs here", "entities": []}
{"text": "so how does that compare with the formula that we had up here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of a power of <expression> is that power times <expression> to one less than that power", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats exactly the same as the rule that i wrote down here", "entities": []}
{"text": "but the power here happens to be a negative number and the same negative number shows up as a coefficient and there in the exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "yeah", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor how did i do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor where did that <expression> come from", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im applying this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the denominator in the quotient rule is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> was <expression> so the denominator is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and i decided to write it as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the green comments there", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "what they say is that i can enlarge this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "this exact same rule is true for negative values of <expression> as well as positive values of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres something new in your list of rules that you can apply of values of the derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "that standard rule is true for negative as well as positive exponents", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that comes out of a quotient rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "okay so weve done two rules", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive talked about the product rule and the quotient rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 33}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 42, "end_offset": 55}]}
{"text": "whats next", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "so this is a composition rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 29}]}
{"text": "so the kind of thing that i have in mind composition of functions is about substitution", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the kind of function that i have in mind is for instance <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a new one", "entities": []}
{"text": "we havent seen how to differentiate that before i think", "entities": []}
{"text": "this kind of power of a trig function happens very often", "entities": []}
{"text": "youve seen them happen as well im sure already", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theres a little notational switch that people use", "entities": []}
{"text": "theyll write <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but remember that when you write <expression> what you mean is take the sine of <expression> and then take the 10th power of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the meaning of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the method of dealing with this kind of composition of functions is to use new variable names", "entities": []}
{"text": "what i mean is i can think of this <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can think of it it as a two step process", "entities": []}
{"text": "first of all i compute the sine of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and lets call the result <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "theres the new variable name", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i express <expression> in terms of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "so <expression> says take this and raise it to the tenth power", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then you plug <equation> into that and you get the formula for what <expression> is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its good practice to introduce new letters when theyre convenient and this is one place where its very convenient", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets find a rule for differentiating a composition a function that can be expressed by doing one function and then applying another function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and heres the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "well maybe ill actually derive this rule first and then youll see what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "in fact the rule is very simple to derive", "entities": []}
{"text": "so this is a proof first and then well write down the rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "im interested in <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and im interested in how <expression> changes with respect to <expression> with respect to the original variable <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well because of that intermediate variable i can write this as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "it cancels right", "entities": []}
{"text": "the <expression> cancels", "entities": []}
{"text": "the change in that immediate variable cancels out", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is just basic algebra", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what happens when i let <expression> get small", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "well this give me <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "on the righthand side i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so students will often remember this rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the rule by saying that you can cancel out for the dxs", "entities": []}
{"text": "and thats not so far from the truth", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats a good way to think of it", "entities": []}
{"text": "in other words this is the socalled chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "and it says that differentiation of a composition is a product", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just the product of the two derivatives", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats how you differentiate a composite of two functions", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 30}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 59}]}
{"text": "and lets just do an example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do this example", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets see how that comes out", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets differentiate what did i say", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "<expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay theres an inside function and an outside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "the inside function is <expression> as a function of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is the inside function and this is the outside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the rule says first of all lets differentiate the outside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "take <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}]}
{"text": "differentiate it with respect to that variable <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "the outside function is the 10th power", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats its derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this account im using this newly introduced variable named <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the derivative of the outside function is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then heres the inside function and the next thing i want to do is differentiate it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so whats <expression> the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what the chain rule gives you", "entities": [{"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 25}]}
{"text": "this is correct but since we were the ones to introduce this notation <expression> here that wasnt given to us in the original problem here", "entities": []}
{"text": "the last step in this process should be to put back to substitute back in what <expression> is in terms of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so that tells me that i get <expression> thats <expression> times the <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}]}
{"text": "or the same thing is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so theres an application of the chain rule", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 32, "end_offset": 42}]}
{"text": "you know people often wonder where the name chain rule comes from", "entities": []}
{"text": "i was just wondering about that myself", "entities": []}
{"text": "so is it because it chains you down", "entities": []}
{"text": "is it like a chain fence", "entities": []}
{"text": "i decided what it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "its because by using it you burst the chains of differentiation and you can differentiate many more functions using it", "entities": []}
{"text": "so when you want to think of the chain rule just think of that chain there", "entities": []}
{"text": "it lets you burst free", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me give you another application of the chain rule", "entities": []}
{"text": "ready for this one", "entities": []}
{"text": "so id like to differentiate the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "again this is the composite of two functions", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the inside function", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so i think ill introduce this new notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "<equation> and the outside function is the sine", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so now the chain rule says <expression> is", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 21}]}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "i take the derivative of the outside function and whats that", "entities": []}
{"text": "sine prime and we can substitute because we know what sine prime is", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 22, "end_offset": 32}]}
{"text": "so i get cosine of whatever <expression> and then times what", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i differentiate the inside function which is just <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 19}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "so i could write this as <expression> of what", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now once you get used to this this middle variable you dont have to give a name for it", "entities": []}
{"text": "you can just to think about it in your mind without actually writing it down <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill just do it again without introducing this middle variable explicitly", "entities": []}
{"text": "think about it", "entities": []}
{"text": "i first of all differentiate the outside function and i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 15, "end_offset": 28}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 33, "end_offset": 49}]}
{"text": "but i dont change the thing that im plugging into it", "entities": []}
{"text": "its still <expression> that im plugging into it", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets just write <expression> and not worry about the name of that extra variable", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "if it confuses you introduce the new variable", "entities": []}
{"text": "and do it carefully and slowly like this", "entities": []}
{"text": "but quite quickly i think youll get to be able to keep that step in your mind", "entities": []}
{"text": "im not quite done yet", "entities": []}
{"text": "i havent differentiated the inside function the derivative of <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so you get again the same result", "entities": []}
{"text": "a little shortcut that youll get used to", "entities": []}
{"text": "really and truly once you have the chain rule the world is yours to conquer", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 35, "end_offset": 45}]}
{"text": "it puts you in a very very powerful position", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "what have i covered today", "entities": []}
{"text": "ive talked about product rule quotient rule composition", "entities": [{"label": "method", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 29}, {"label": "method", "start_offset": 30, "end_offset": 43}]}
{"text": "i should tell you something about higher derivatives as well", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do that", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is a simple story", "entities": []}
{"text": "higher is kind of a strange word", "entities": []}
{"text": "it just means differentiate over and over again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 14, "end_offset": 27}]}
{"text": "all right so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "if we have a function <expression> or <expression> please allow me to just write it as briefly as <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "well this is a sort of notational thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "i can differentiate it and get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 19}]}
{"text": "thats a new function", "entities": []}
{"text": "like if you started with the sine thats gonna be the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "a new function so i can differentiate it again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 24, "end_offset": 37}]}
{"text": "and the notation for the differentiating of it again is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so <expression> is just <expression> differentiated again", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example if <expression> is the <expression> so <expression> is the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "has professor jerison talked about what the derivative of <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "what is it", "entities": []}
{"text": "ha okay so <expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "let me go on", "entities": []}
{"text": "what do you suppose <expression> means", "entities": []}
{"text": "i guess its the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called the third derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and <expression> is called the second derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its <expression> differentiated again", "entities": []}
{"text": "so to compute <expression> in this example what do i do", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 6, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "i differentiate that again", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 15}]}
{"text": "theres a constant term <expression> constant factor", "entities": []}
{"text": "that comes out", "entities": []}
{"text": "the derivative of <expression> is what", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay so <equation>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do it again", "entities": []}
{"text": "now after a while you get tired of writing these things", "entities": []}
{"text": "and so maybe ill use the notation <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "thats the fourth derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "or its <expression> differentiated again the fourth derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what is that in this example", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay the <expression>cosine has derivative minus the <expression> like you told me", "entities": []}
{"text": "and that minus sign cancels with that sign and all together i get <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats pretty bizarre", "entities": []}
{"text": "when i differentiate the function <expression> four times i get back to the <expression> again", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the way it is", "entities": []}
{"text": "now this notation prime prime prime prime and things like that", "entities": []}
{"text": "there are different variants of that notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "for example thats another notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "well youve used the notation <expression> before", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> could also be denoted <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think weve already here today used this way of rewriting <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "i think when i was talking about <expression> and so on i pulled that <expression> outside and put whatever function youre differentiating over to the right", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats just a notational switch", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks good", "entities": []}
{"text": "it looks like good algebra doesnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "but what its doing is regarding this notation as an operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "its something you apply to a function to get a new function", "entities": []}
{"text": "i apply it to the sine function and i get the cosine function", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "i apply it to <expression> and i get <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 2, "end_offset": 7}]}
{"text": "this thing here that symbol represents an operator which you apply to a function", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the operator says take the function and differentiate it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 57}]}
{"text": "so further notation that people often use is they give a different name to that operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "and theyll write capital d for it", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "so this is just using capital d for the symbol <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so in terms of that notation lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write down what higher derivatives look like", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "how about <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets write that in terms of the <expression> notation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 10}]}
{"text": "well im supposed to differentiate <expression> right", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 20, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "so thats <expression> applied to the function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "differentiate the derivative", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "thats what ive done", "entities": []}
{"text": "or i could write that as <expression> applied to <expression> applied to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 11, "end_offset": 16}]}
{"text": "just pulling that <expression> outside", "entities": []}
{"text": "so im doing <expression> twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "im doing that operator twice", "entities": []}
{"text": "i could write that as <expression> applied to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 8, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "differentiate twice and do it to the function <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13}]}
{"text": "or i can write it as now this is a strange one", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 14}]}
{"text": "i could also write as like that", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 13, "end_offset": 18}]}
{"text": "its getting stranger and stranger isnt it", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is definitely just a kind of abuse of notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "but people will go even further and write <expression> by <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 41}]}
{"text": "so this is the strangest one", "entities": []}
{"text": "this identity quality is the strangest one because you may think that youre taking <expression> of the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "but thats not whats intended", "entities": []}
{"text": "this is not <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats intended is the quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "in this notation which is very common whats intended by the denominator is the quantity <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "its part of this second differentiation operator", "entities": []}
{"text": "so ive written a bunch of equalities down here and the only content to them is that these are all different notations for the same thing", "entities": []}
{"text": "youll see this notation very commonly", "entities": []}
{"text": "so for instance the third derivative is <expression> and so on", "entities": []}
{"text": "sorry", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor yes absolutely", "entities": []}
{"text": "or an equally good notation is to write the operator <expression> done three times to <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 34, "end_offset": 39}]}
{"text": "absolutely", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i guess i should also write over here when i was talking about <expression> the second derivative another notation is do the operator <expression> twice", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 25, "end_offset": 30}]}
{"text": "lets see an example of how this can be applied", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill answer this question", "entities": []}
{"text": "student inaudible", "entities": []}
{"text": "professor yeah so the question is whether the fourth derivative always gives you the original function back like what happened here", "entities": []}
{"text": "no", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats very very special to sines and cosines", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "and in fact lets see an example of that", "entities": []}
{"text": "ill do a calculation", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 4, "end_offset": 6}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 9, "end_offset": 20}]}
{"text": "lets calculate the nth derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 14}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 33}]}
{"text": "okay <expression> is a number like <expression> <expression> <expression> <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "here we go", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets do this", "entities": []}
{"text": "so lets do this bit by bit", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the first derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so everybody knows this", "entities": []}
{"text": "im just using a new notation this capital d notation", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "now know by the way <expression> could be a negative number for that but for now for this application i wanna take <expression> to be <expression> <expression> <expression> and so on one of those numbers", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 110, "end_offset": 114}]}
{"text": "okay we did one derivative", "entities": []}
{"text": "lets compute the second derivative of <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 5, "end_offset": 12}]}
{"text": "well theres this <expression> constant that comes out and then the exponent comes down and it gets reduced by <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "all right", "entities": []}
{"text": "should i do one more", "entities": []}
{"text": "<expression> is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "thats the constant from here", "entities": []}
{"text": "times that exponent <expression> less <expression> is the new exponent", "entities": []}
{"text": "well i keep on going until i come to a new blackboard", "entities": []}
{"text": "now i think im going to stop when i get to the <expression> minus first derivative so we can see whats likely to happen", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 65}, {"label": "command_attribute", "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 82}]}
{"text": "so when i took the third derivative i had the <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and when i took the second derivative i had the second power of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i think whatll happen when i have the n minus first derivative is ill have the first power of <expression> left over", "entities": []}
{"text": "the powers of <expression> keep coming down", "entities": []}
{"text": "and what ive done it <expression> times i get the first power", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i get a big constant out in front here times more and more and more of these smaller and smaller integers that come down", "entities": []}
{"text": "whats the last integer that came down before i got <expression> here", "entities": []}
{"text": "well lets see", "entities": []}
{"text": "its just <expression> because this <expression> occurred as the derivative of <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and the coefficient in front of that is <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "so thats what you get", "entities": []}
{"text": "the numbers <expression> <expression> and so on down to <expression> times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and now we can differentiate one more time and calculate what <expression> is", "entities": []}
{"text": "so i get the same number <expression> and so on and so on times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "and then i guess ill say times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "times whats the derivative of <equation> so times <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "time <expression> times <expression>", "entities": [{"label": "command", "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 4}, {"label": "command", "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 23}]}
{"text": "where this one means the constant function <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "does anyone know what this number is called", "entities": []}
{"text": "that has a name", "entities": []}
{"text": "its called <expression> factorial", "entities": []}
{"text": "and its written <expression> exclamation point", "entities": []}
{"text": "and we just used an example of mathematical induction", "entities": []}
{"text": "so the end result is <expression> is <expression> constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay thats a neat fact", "entities": []}
{"text": "final question for the lecture is whats <expression> applied to <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "ha", "entities": []}
{"text": "excellent", "entities": []}
{"text": "its the derivative of a constant", "entities": []}
{"text": "so its <expression>", "entities": []}
{"text": "okay", "entities": []}
{"text": "thank you", "entities": []}
