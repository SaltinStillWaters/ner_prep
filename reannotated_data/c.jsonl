{"id":5618,"text":"So this is really a hard step in disguise, in real life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5619,"text":"Anyway, we're just going to take it as given.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5621,"text":"So let's count up what its degree has to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5622,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5623,"text":"So this is degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5625,"text":"So all together it's this, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5626,"text":"And so this thing is of degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5627,"text":"All the way up to degree <EXPRESSION>, that's the possibilities for the numerator here.","entities":[{"id":1027,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":72,"end_offset":81}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5629,"text":"Which I called Step <EXPRESSION> last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5630,"text":"And the setup is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5631,"text":"Now, it's going to take us a while to do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5632,"text":"We have this factor here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5636,"text":"We have another term with the <EXPRESSION> power.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5637,"text":"So this is what's going to happen whenever you have linear factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5638,"text":"You'll have a collection of terms like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5639,"text":"So you have <EXPRESSION> constants to take care of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5640,"text":"Now, with a quadratic in the denominator, you need a linear function in the numerator.","entities":[{"id":1033,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":29,"end_offset":40},{"id":1034,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":76,"end_offset":85}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5646,"text":"Now notice, just as in the case of this top row, I have just a constant here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5653,"text":"And here I stayed a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5657,"text":"I don't have quite as jazzy a song on mine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5658,"text":"So this is so long that it runs off the blackboard here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5659,"text":"So let's continue it on the next.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5660,"text":"We've got this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5661,"text":"I guess I have room for it over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5662,"text":"I'm going to talk about this in just a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5663,"text":"Alright, so here's the pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5664,"text":"Now, let me just do a count of the number of unknowns we have here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5666,"text":"That <EXPRESSION> is no coincidence.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5667,"text":"That's the degree of the polynomial.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5668,"text":"And it's the number of unknowns that we have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5669,"text":"And it's the number of degrees of freedom in a polynomial of degree <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5672,"text":"And so this is a very complicated system of equations for unknowns.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5676,"text":"So that's the other bad news.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5681,"text":"You'll be able to evaluate this in no time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5686,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5687,"text":"So there's an equation, there's this function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5706,"text":"This is about a page of writing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5707,"text":"So just think of your machine, how much time you want to spend on this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5708,"text":"So the answer is that you have to be realistic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5729,"text":"So this is why I'm mentioning this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5730,"text":"Because this kind of ingredient is something you already covered.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5731,"text":"And what is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5732,"text":"Well, you do this <EXPRESSION> by advanced guessing, although you it as the method of substitution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5733,"text":"You realize that it's going to be of the form <EXPRESSION>, roughly speaking.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5734,"text":"And now we're going to fix that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5810,"text":"It's not the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5840,"text":"Alright, now I'm going to show you how it works on a few examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5842,"text":"But it'll grow as we get more and more experience.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5844,"text":"Which is the integral of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1078,"label":"method","start_offset":13,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5845,"text":"Now, it looks like there's sort of nothing we can do with this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5846,"text":"And we don't know what the solution is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5847,"text":"However, I claim that if we fit it into this form, we can figure out what the integral is relatively easily.","entities":[{"id":1079,"label":"method","start_offset":78,"end_offset":86}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5848,"text":"By some little magic of cancellation it happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5849,"text":"The idea is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5851,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5852,"text":"Now, <EXPRESSION> is a more manageable function than <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5853,"text":"What we're using is that when we differentiate the function, it's getting nicer.","entities":[{"id":1080,"label":"command","start_offset":33,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5854,"text":"It's getting more tractable for us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5855,"text":"In order for this to fit into this pattern, however, I need a function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5856,"text":"So what in the world am I going to put here for <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5857,"text":"The answer is, well, <EXPRESSION> is almost the right answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5858,"text":"The answer turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5859,"text":"And the reason is that that makes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5860,"text":"It makes <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5861,"text":"So that means that this is <EXPRESSION>, but it's also <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5862,"text":"Which was what I had on the left-hand side.","entities":[{"id":1082,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":28,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5863,"text":"So it's both <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5864,"text":"So this is the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5865,"text":"And now all I'm going to do is read off what the formula says.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5866,"text":"What it says is, this = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5867,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is this and <EXPRESSION> is that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5868,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so that again, this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5869,"text":"Except in the other order, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5870,"text":"And then I'm integrating, and what do I have to integrate?","entities":[{"id":1083,"label":"command","start_offset":48,"end_offset":57}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5871,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5873,"text":"<EXPRESSION> with a <EXPRESSION> sign here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5874,"text":"<EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":5878,"text":"Because <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5879,"text":"And the integral of <EQUATION>, if you like.","entities":[{"id":1085,"label":"method","start_offset":8,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5880,"text":"So the antiderivative of <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":1086,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5881,"text":"And so here's our answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5882,"text":"Our answer is that this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5883,"text":"I'm going to do <EXPRESSION> more slightly more complicated examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5884,"text":"And then really, the main thing is to get yourself used to this method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5885,"text":"And there's no <EXPRESSION> way of doing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5886,"text":"Just practice makes perfect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5887,"text":"And so we'll just do a few more examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5888,"text":"And illustrate them.","entities":[{"id":1088,"label":"command","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5890,"text":"And this is just slightly more recalcitrant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5891,"text":"Namely, I'm going to let <EXPRESSION> be <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5892,"text":"And again, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5893,"text":"So that matches up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5894,"text":"That is, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5895,"text":"So this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5896,"text":"So this thing is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5897,"text":"And then we'll just see what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5899,"text":"It's not going to win us the whole battle, but it will get us started.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5900,"text":"So here we get <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5901,"text":"And that's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5902,"text":"Applying the chain rule.","entities":[{"id":1093,"label":"method","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5903,"text":"And so the formula is that this is <EQUATION>, minus the integral of, well it's <EQUATION>, right, that's what I have to put over here.","entities":[{"id":1094,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":52},{"id":1095,"label":"method","start_offset":57,"end_offset":65}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5904,"text":"So <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5905,"text":"And so now, you notice something interesting happening here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5906,"text":"So let me just demarcate this a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5907,"text":"And let you see what it is that I'm doing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5908,"text":"So notice, this is the same integral.","entities":[{"id":1097,"label":"method","start_offset":28,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5909,"text":"So here we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5910,"text":"We've already solve that part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5911,"text":"But now know notice that the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> cancel.","entities":[{"id":1098,"label":"command","start_offset":63,"end_offset":69}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5912,"text":"So we're back to the previous case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5913,"text":"We didn't win all the way, but actually we reduced ourselves to this integral.","entities":[{"id":1099,"label":"method","start_offset":69,"end_offset":77}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5914,"text":"To the integral of <EXPRESSION>, which we already know.","entities":[{"id":1100,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5915,"text":"So here, I can copy that down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5916,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>, and then I have to throw in a constant, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5917,"text":"And that's the end of the problem here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5918,"text":"That's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5919,"text":"So this piece, I got from Example <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5920,"text":"Now, this illustrates a principle which is a little bit more complicated than just the <EXPRESSION> of integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":1101,"label":"method","start_offset":103,"end_offset":123}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5923,"text":"Which is a little bit simpler.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5925,"text":"So the example is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5928,"text":"And that way I can get all the way back down to the final answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5929,"text":"So here's what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5931,"text":"This is the same discussion as before, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5932,"text":"And then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5933,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5934,"text":"And so the setup is similar.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5935,"text":"We have here <EXPRESSION> the integral.","entities":[{"id":1103,"label":"method","start_offset":30,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5936,"text":"And there's <EXPRESSION> times, it turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1104,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5937,"text":"And then there's a <EXPRESSION>, which cancel.","entities":[{"id":1105,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5938,"text":"So I'm going to explain this also abstractly a little bit just to show you what's happening here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5940,"text":"Then the relationship that we have here is that <EXPRESSION>, I'm sorry, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5941,"text":"That's the <EXPRESSION> term over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5942,"text":"<EXPRESSION> times the preceding <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1108,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5943,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5944,"text":"And the idea is that eventually we can get down.","entities":[{"id":1109,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5946,"text":"Then we can reduce to the <EXPRESSION>, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5949,"text":"So this is the idea of a reduction formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5951,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> step would be to evaluate the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5952,"text":"Which is, if you like, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5953,"text":"That's very easy, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5954,"text":"And then <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5955,"text":"Now, that's applying this rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5956,"text":"So let me just put it in a box here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5957,"text":"This is the method of induction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5958,"text":"Here's the rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5959,"text":"And I'm applying it for <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5960,"text":"I plugged in <EQUATION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5961,"text":"So here, I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5962,"text":"And that's what I put right here, on the right-hand side.","entities":[{"id":1111,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":41,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5963,"text":"And that's going to generate for me the formula that I want, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5964,"text":"That's the answer to this problem over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5965,"text":"This was Example <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5966,"text":"Notice I dropped the constants because I can add them in at the end.","entities":[{"id":1112,"label":"command","start_offset":45,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5967,"text":"So I'll put in parentheses here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5968,"text":"That's what would happen at the end of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5970,"text":"I'm just summarizing what I did on that blackboard right up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5971,"text":"The same thing, but in much more compact notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5972,"text":"If I take <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1114,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5973,"text":"Again, this is box for <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5974,"text":"And if I plug it in, what I'm getting here is <EQUATION> twice this stuff here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5975,"text":"Which is right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5976,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5977,"text":"If you like, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5978,"text":"So I'll leave the <EXPRESSION> off.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5979,"text":"So this is how reduction formulas work in general.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5980,"text":"I'm going to give you <EXPRESSION> more example of a reduction formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5981,"text":"So I guess we have to call this Example <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5982,"text":"Let's be fancy, let's make it the sine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5983,"text":"No no, no, let's be fancier still.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5984,"text":"Let's make it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5985,"text":"So this would also work for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5986,"text":"The same sort of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5987,"text":"And I should mention that on your homework, you have to do it for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5988,"text":"I decided to change my mind on the spur of the moment.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5990,"text":"In a later homework you'll even do this case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5991,"text":"So it's fine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5992,"text":"You need the practice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5993,"text":"OK, so how am I going to do it this time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5994,"text":"This is again, a reduction formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5996,"text":"And the reason is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":5997,"text":"So it's very important to pick which function is the <EXPRESSION> and which function is the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6004,"text":"And if I differentiated that, if I did it the other way around and I differentiated that, I would just get the same level of complexity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6005,"text":"Differentiating <EXPRESSION> just gives you back <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6006,"text":"So that's boring.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6007,"text":"It doesn't make any progress in this process.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6008,"text":"And so I'm going to instead let <EXPRESSION> and, sorry this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6009,"text":"Make it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6010,"text":"And then <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6011,"text":"At least it isn't any worse when I went backwards like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6012,"text":"So now, I have <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, and now I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6013,"text":"This again is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6014,"text":"So it happens that <EQUATION> so it's a little confusing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6015,"text":"But this is the <EXPRESSION> we're calling <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6016,"text":"And here's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6017,"text":"And now minus the integral and I have here <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1121,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":13},{"id":1122,"label":"method","start_offset":18,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6018,"text":"And I have here <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6019,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION> and this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6020,"text":"So this recurrence is a new recurrence.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6021,"text":"And let me summarize it here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6022,"text":"It's saying that <EXPRESSION> should be the integral of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1123,"label":"method","start_offset":44,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6023,"text":"Again, I'm dropping the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6024,"text":"And then the reduction formula is that <EXPRESSION> = this expression here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6025,"text":"So here's our reduction formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6027,"text":"The antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION>, that getting started at the real basement here.","entities":[{"id":1126,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6028,"text":"Again, as always, <EXPRESSION> is my favorite number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6029,"text":"Not <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6030,"text":"I always start with the easiest <EXPRESSION>, if possible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6033,"text":"And so that's just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6034,"text":"So this is a very, very fancy way of saying the following fact.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6035,"text":"I'll put it over on this other board.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6036,"text":"Which is that the integral of <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":1127,"label":"method","start_offset":18,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6037,"text":"Yeah, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6038,"text":"Why is this statement true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6039,"text":"Why is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6040,"text":"I did that in my head.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6041,"text":"What I did was, I <EXPRESSION> wrote down the formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6042,"text":"Which was <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6043,"text":"Because there's an <EXPRESSION> in there, which is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6044,"text":"And then I know the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1128,"label":"method","start_offset":20,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6045,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6046,"text":"The answer is only by experience.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6047,"text":"You must get practice doing this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6048,"text":"If you look in your textbook, you'll see hints as to what to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6049,"text":"The other hint that I want to say is that if you find that you have <EXPRESSION> factor in your expression which when you differentiate it, it gets easier.","entities":[{"id":1131,"label":"command","start_offset":30,"end_offset":33},{"id":1132,"label":"command","start_offset":122,"end_offset":135}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6050,"text":"And when you antidifferentiate the other half, it doesn't get any worse, then that's when this method has a chance of helping.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6051,"text":"And there is there's no general thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6052,"text":"The thing is, though, if you it with <EXPRESSION>, especially on <EXPRESSION>, those are examples where it works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6053,"text":"This power of the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6055,"text":"So this was <EXPRESSION>, right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6058,"text":"There's a mistake here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6059,"text":"That's bad.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6060,"text":"I was thinking in the back of my head of the following formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6061,"text":"Which is another <EXPRESSION> which we've just done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6062,"text":"So these are the types of formulas that you can get out of integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":1136,"label":"method","start_offset":59,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6063,"text":"There's also another way of getting these, which I'm not going to say anything about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6064,"text":"Which is called advance guessing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6065,"text":"You guess in advance what the form is, you differentiate it and you check.","entities":[{"id":1138,"label":"command","start_offset":43,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6066,"text":"That does work too, with many of these cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6067,"text":"I want to give you an illustration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6068,"text":"Just because you these formulas are somewhat dry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6069,"text":"So I want to give you just at least <EXPRESSION> application.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6070,"text":"We're almost done with the idea of these formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6071,"text":"And we're going to get back now to being able to handle lots more integrals than we could before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6072,"text":"And what's satisfying is that now we can get numbers out instead of being stuck and hamstrung with only a few techniques.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6073,"text":"Now we have all of the techniques of integration that anybody has.","entities":[{"id":1141,"label":"method","start_offset":37,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6074,"text":"And so we can do pretty much anything we want that's possible to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6075,"text":"So here's, if you like, an application that illustrates how integration by parts can be helpful.","entities":[{"id":1142,"label":"method","start_offset":60,"end_offset":80}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6076,"text":"And we're going to find the volume of an exponential wine glass here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6077,"text":"Again, don't try this at home, but.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6078,"text":"So let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6079,"text":"It's going to be this beautiful guy here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6080,"text":"I think.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6081,"text":"OK, so what's it going to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6082,"text":"This graph is going to be <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":1144,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":10}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6085,"text":"And the top, let's say, is <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":1145,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6086,"text":"So that the horizontal here, coming down, is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6088,"text":"And so there are <EXPRESSION> methods.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6089,"text":"And this is also a good review because, of course, we did this in the last unit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6090,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> methods are horizontal and vertical slices.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6091,"text":"Those are the <EXPRESSION> ways we can do this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6092,"text":"Now, if we do it with, so let's start out with the horizontal ones.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6093,"text":"That's this shape here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6094,"text":"The whole thing evaluated at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6095,"text":"And that is, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6096,"text":"Except there's a factor of <EXPRESSION> there, sorry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6097,"text":"Missed the <EXPRESSION> factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6098,"text":"So there's an <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6099,"text":"And then I subtract off, well, at <EXPRESSION> this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1148,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6100,"text":"So it cancels.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6101,"text":"There's nothing left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6103,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6104,"text":"That's the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6105,"text":"Now we get to compare that with what happens if we do it the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6106,"text":"So what's the vertical?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6107,"text":"So by vertical slicing, we get shells.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6108,"text":"And that starts, that's in the <EXPRESSION> variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6110,"text":"And what are the shells?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6113,"text":"The bottom value is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6115,"text":"Okay so I'd like to begin the <EXPRESSION> lecture by reminding you what we did last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6117,"text":"So that was our geometric point of view and we also did a couple of computations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6118,"text":"We worked out that the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1152,"label":"method","start_offset":23,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6119,"text":"And we also computed the derivative of <EXPRESSION> to the nth power for <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION>, etc.","entities":[{"id":1153,"label":"method","start_offset":25,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6121,"text":"So that's what we did last time, and today I want to finish up with other points of view on what a derivative is.","entities":[{"id":1154,"label":"method","start_offset":99,"end_offset":109}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6122,"text":"So this is extremely important, it's almost the most important thing I'll be saying in the class.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6123,"text":"But you'll have to think about it again when you start over and start using calculus in the real world.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6124,"text":"So again we're talking about what is a derivative and this is just a continuation of last time.","entities":[{"id":1155,"label":"method","start_offset":39,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6125,"text":"So, as I said last time, we talked about geometric interpretations, and today what we're gonna talk about is rate of change as an interpretation of the derivative.","entities":[{"id":1156,"label":"method","start_offset":152,"end_offset":162}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6128,"text":"This is the average change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6131,"text":"Okay, so that's the point of view that I'd like to discuss now and give you just a couple of examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6132,"text":"So, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6138,"text":"And I get to use the example of this very building to do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6145,"text":"Well I'm cheating here, but there's a special case that's obvious.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6146,"text":"I didn't throw it in over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6156,"text":"And at the bottom, at that point of impact, we have <EQUATION> and so <EXPRESSION>, which is the derivative, = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1160,"label":"method","start_offset":97,"end_offset":107}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6158,"text":"Which is why the police are there at midnight on Halloween to make sure you're all safe and also why when you come you have to be prepared to clean up afterwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6159,"text":"So anyway that's what happens, it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6160,"text":"An easy limit is something like the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6161,"text":"And with this kind of limit all I have to do to evaluate it is to plug in <EQUATION> because, so what I get here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6162,"text":"And that's just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6163,"text":"And that's the end of it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6164,"text":"So those are the easy limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6165,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> kind of limit - well so this isn't the only <EXPRESSION> kind of limit but I just want to point this out, it's very important - is that: derivatives are are always harder than this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6166,"text":"You can't get away with nothing here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6167,"text":"So, why is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6169,"text":"Here's the formula for the derivative.","entities":[{"id":1163,"label":"method","start_offset":27,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6170,"text":"Now notice that if you plug in <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6171,"text":"So it just basically never works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6172,"text":"So we always are going to need some cancellation to make sense out of the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6176,"text":"And I can display it visually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6177,"text":"So what does this mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6179,"text":"That means <EXPRESSION> is bigger than <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6181,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6184,"text":"So that <EXPRESSION> has the minus sign here.","entities":[{"id":1164,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6185,"text":"I'm just a little dyslexic and I hope you're not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6186,"text":"So I may have gotten that wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6191,"text":"It's much more convenient to have this extra bit of description of limits than to just consider limits from both sides.","entities":[{"id":1165,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":108,"end_offset":118}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6192,"text":"Okay so I want to give an example of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6193,"text":"And also an example of how you're going to think about these sorts of problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6194,"text":"So I'll take a function which has <EXPRESSION> different definitions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6195,"text":"Say it's <EXPRESSION>, when <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1167,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":3}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6196,"text":"So maybe put commas there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6197,"text":"So when <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6198,"text":"Now draw <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1168,"label":"command","start_offset":4,"end_offset":8}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6199,"text":"It's gonna be kind of a little small because I'm gonna try to fit it down in here, but maybe I'll put the axis down below.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6201,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6202,"text":"Today I want to get started by correcting a mistake that I made last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6203,"text":"And this was mistaken terminology.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6204,"text":"I said that what we were computing, when we computed in this candy bar example, was energy and not heat.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6205,"text":"But it's both.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6206,"text":"They're the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6207,"text":"And in fact, energy, heat and work are all the same thing in physics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6208,"text":"I was foolishly considering the much more - what am I trying to say - the intuitive feeling of heat as just being the same as temperature.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6209,"text":"But in physics, usually heat is measured in calories and energy can be in lots of things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6212,"text":"That is, lifting some weight some distance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6214,"text":"And these all have conversions between them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6215,"text":"They're all the same quantity, in different units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6216,"text":"OK, so these are the same quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6217,"text":"Different units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6218,"text":"So that's about as much physics as we'll do for today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6219,"text":"And sorry about that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6220,"text":"Now, the example that I was starting to discuss last time and that I'm going to carry out today was this dartboard example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6227,"text":"We're going over an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6233,"text":"And I'm really going to try to make them pretty realistic assumptions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6307,"text":"That is, suppose you imagine, the question is, what does this left-hand side mean.","entities":[{"id":1171,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":62,"end_offset":76}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6308,"text":"That right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6309,"text":"Is that the question that's you're asking?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6310,"text":"When I try to understand what the distribution of dartboard hits is, I should imagine my dartboard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6311,"text":"And very often there'll be a whole bunch of holes in some places.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6312,"text":"And fewer holes else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6313,"text":"I'm trying to figure out what the whole distribution of those marks is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6314,"text":"And so some places will have more hits on them and some places will have fewer hits on them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6315,"text":"And so what I want to measure is, on average, the number of hits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6319,"text":"So that's where this constant comes in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6323,"text":"So that's what we're saying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6344,"text":"So, having discussed the setup, this is a pretty standard setup Oh, <EXPRESSION> more question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6345,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6348,"text":"So I can answer this with an analogy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6361,"text":"And in fact, the person hits rather rarely near the center.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6362,"text":"So this is not a ridiculous thing to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6364,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6365,"text":"I'll tell you in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6375,"text":"That actually happens a lot.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6379,"text":"<EXPRESSION> more question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6381,"text":"In fact, that requires further justification.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6382,"text":"It's an interesting issue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6383,"text":"Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6384,"text":"And it's something which really has to be justified.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6385,"text":"In certain circumstances it is justified.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6386,"text":"But, OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6387,"text":"So anyway, here's our part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6388,"text":"This is going to be our chunk, for now, that we're going to estimate the importance, the relative importance, of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6390,"text":"It's just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6391,"text":"If you differentiate that, you get a <EXPRESSION>, which cancels the minus sign here.","entities":[{"id":1172,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":20},{"id":1174,"label":"command","start_offset":69,"end_offset":74}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6392,"text":"So you get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6393,"text":"So that's the antiderivative.","entities":[{"id":1176,"label":"method","start_offset":14,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6394,"text":"And we're evaluating it at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6397,"text":"So this is what our part gives us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6398,"text":"And, more technically, if you wanted to multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, it would be <EXPRESSION> times this.","entities":[{"id":1179,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":48},{"id":1180,"label":"command","start_offset":99,"end_offset":104}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6400,"text":"OK, now I want to work So, if you like, the part =, maybe even I'll call it <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1182,"label":"command","start_offset":90,"end_offset":95}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6401,"text":"That's what it really is if I put in this factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6402,"text":"So now there's no prejudice as to how many attempts we make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6404,"text":"Now, the most important <EXPRESSION> feature here of these kinds of modeling problems is, there is always some kind of idealization.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6405,"text":"And the next thing that I want to discuss with you is the interpretation of the whole.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6406,"text":"That is, what's the family of all possibilities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6407,"text":"And in this case, what I'm going to claim is that the reasonable way to think of the whole is it's that r can range all the way from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6408,"text":"Now, you may not like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6410,"text":"So infinity is a really useful concept.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6411,"text":"Of course, it's nonsense in the context of the darts.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6412,"text":"Because if you think of the basement wall where the kid might miss a target, he'd probably hit the wall.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6418,"text":"So by doing this, I'm idealizing the problem but I'm actually making the numbers come out much more cleanly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6419,"text":"And this is just always done in mathematics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6420,"text":"That's what we did when we went from differences to differentials, to differentiation and infinitesimals.","entities":[{"id":1183,"label":"method","start_offset":70,"end_offset":85}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6421,"text":"So we like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6422,"text":"Because it makes things easier, not because it makes things harder.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6424,"text":"And now let's just see what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6427,"text":"Minus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1184,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6428,"text":"Which is that negligibly small number, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6429,"text":"So this is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6430,"text":"Because this number is <EXPRESSION>, and this other number is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6431,"text":"This is just <EXPRESSION> in the parentheses there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6432,"text":"And now I can tell you from these <EXPRESSION> numbers what the probability is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6433,"text":"The probability that we landed on the target in a radius between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, so that's this annulus here, is the ratio of the part to the whole.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6434,"text":"Which in this case just cancels the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6435,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6436,"text":"There's the formula for the probability.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6438,"text":"It's all gone.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6439,"text":"Now, again, let me just emphasize the way this formula is supposed to work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6441,"text":"This is some fraction of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6442,"text":"If you like, it's a percent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6443,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6444,"text":"This gives you the probability of the ring, but this is a very, very wide ring.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6446,"text":"And then going all the way out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6447,"text":"So that's everything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6448,"text":"So this corresponds to everything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6449,"text":"This corresponds to a ring.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6450,"text":"So now, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6451,"text":"Where do I want to go from here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6452,"text":"So in order to make progress here, I still have to give you <EXPRESSION> more piece of information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6453,"text":"And this is, again, supposed to be realistic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6457,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6470,"text":"This is between <EXPRESSION> o'clock and <EXPRESSION> o'clock.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6472,"text":"So this section is the part, the chunk that we want to see about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6473,"text":"And this is a, and then this distance here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6474,"text":"And then the longest distance here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6475,"text":"So the longest distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6477,"text":"Because <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6478,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of the probability that we're between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6479,"text":"That's the number that we're looking for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6480,"text":"Another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6481,"text":"So we made a very, very bold assumption here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6482,"text":"We assumed that this human being, who is actually standing The floor is about down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6483,"text":"Maybe he wasn't that tall.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6484,"text":"But anyway, so he's really a little bigger than this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6485,"text":"That the part of him that was close to the target covered about this section here, between radius <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6487,"text":"So we're just worried about the part that's closest to the target here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6488,"text":"Because I made it a clock.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6489,"text":"And I made it from <EXPRESSION> o'clock to <EXPRESSION> o'clock, so it's <EXPRESSION> of the <EXPRESSION> hours of a clock.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6490,"text":"It's just a way of me making a section that you can visibly see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6491,"text":"So now, so here's what we're trying to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6492,"text":"And in order to figure this out, I need <EXPRESSION> more item.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6493,"text":"here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6494,"text":"So maybe I'll leave myself a little bit of room.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6495,"text":"I have to figure out something about what our information gave us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6496,"text":"Which is that the probability, sorry, this probability was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6497,"text":"So let's remember what this is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6498,"text":"This is going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6499,"text":"That's what's this probability is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6500,"text":"And that's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6501,"text":"So that means that <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6502,"text":"= <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6503,"text":"Which means that <EXPRESSION> = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6505,"text":"That's what I'll use.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6506,"text":"And now I'm going to calculate this other probability here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6507,"text":"So the probability right up there is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6508,"text":"And that's going to be the same as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6509,"text":"That's what we calculated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6510,"text":"And now I want to use some of the arithmetic of exponents.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6511,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6512,"text":"Because it's really <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the quantity is <EXPRESSION>, and then I bring that exponent out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6513,"text":"Minus <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION> power, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1189,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6514,"text":"And so this comes out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6515,"text":"Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6516,"text":"This is negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6517,"text":"This part here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6518,"text":"And this is actually why these tails, as you go out to infinity, don't really matter that much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6519,"text":"So this is a much smaller number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6520,"text":"So the probability of the whole band is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6521,"text":"And now I can answer the question up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6522,"text":"This is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6523,"text":"Which is about <EXPRESSION>, or about <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6524,"text":"So if I stood there for <EXPRESSION> attempts, then my chances of getting hit were pretty high.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6525,"text":"So that's the computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6526,"text":"That's a typical example of a problem in probability.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6527,"text":"And let me just make <EXPRESSION> more connection with what we did before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6528,"text":"This is connected to weighted averages or integrals over weights.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6529,"text":"But the weight that's involved in this problem was <EXPRESSION> = So let's just look at what happened in all of those integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6530,"text":"What happened in all the integrals was, we had this factor here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6531,"text":"And if I include this <EXPRESSION>, it was really <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6532,"text":"This was the weight that we were using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6533,"text":"The relative importance of things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6534,"text":"Now, this is not the same as the <EXPRESSION> that we started out with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6535,"text":"Because this is the <EXPRESSION>-dimensional histogram.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6537,"text":"So that also connects with the question at the beginning, which had to do with this paradox, that it looks like these places in the middle are the most likely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6541,"text":"And actually, so this is what's happening really.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6542,"text":"In terms of how likely it is that you'll get within a certain distance of the center of the target.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6543,"text":"Again, it's not the area under that curve that we're doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6544,"text":"It's that volume of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6545,"text":"We're going to change subjects now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6546,"text":"OK, <EXPRESSION> more question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6547,"text":"Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6548,"text":"It's a question of which variable you're using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6549,"text":"According to pure radius, it's not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6550,"text":"It turns out that there are some bands in radius which are more important, more likely for hits than others.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6551,"text":"It really has to do with the fact that the center, or the core, of the target is really tiny.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6552,"text":"So it's harder to hit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6553,"text":"Whereas a whole band around the outside has a lot more area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6554,"text":"Many, many ways to hit that band.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6555,"text":"So it's a much larger area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6556,"text":"So there's a competition there between those <EXPRESSION> things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6557,"text":"So we're going to move on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6558,"text":"And I want to talk now about a different kind of weighted average.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6559,"text":"These weighted averages are going to be much simpler.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6560,"text":"And they come up in what's called numerical integration.","entities":[{"id":1194,"label":"method","start_offset":44,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6561,"text":"There are many, many methods of integrating numerically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6562,"text":"And they're important because many, many integrals don't have formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6563,"text":"And so you have to compute them with a calculator or a machine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6565,"text":"They turned out to be incredibly inefficient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6566,"text":"They're lousy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6567,"text":"The next rule that I'm going to describe is a little improvement.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6568,"text":"It's called the trapezoidal rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6570,"text":"Unfortunately, it's actually also pretty lousy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6571,"text":"There's another rule which is just a slightly trickier rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6572,"text":"And it's actually amazing that it exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6573,"text":"And it's called Simpson's Rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6574,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> is actually pretty good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6575,"text":"It's clever.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6576,"text":"So let's get started with these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6578,"text":"So this is a good review, because you need to know all <EXPRESSION> of these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6579,"text":"And you're going to want to see them all laid out in parallel.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6580,"text":"So here's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6581,"text":"OK, so here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6582,"text":"We have our graph, we have our function, it starts out at <EXPRESSION>, it ends up at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6583,"text":"Maybe goes on, but we're only paying attention to this interval.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6584,"text":"This is a function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6585,"text":"And we split it up when we do Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6586,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>, this is Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6588,"text":"We go all the way over to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6590,"text":"Which are the step sizes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6591,"text":"So we have these little steps of size <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6593,"text":"<EQUATION>, that's the point above <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6594,"text":"Then set <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":1198,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":8}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6596,"text":"In order to figure out the area, you really need to know something about the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6597,"text":"You need to be able to evaluate it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6598,"text":"So that's what we've done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6600,"text":"Enumerated <EXPRESSION> through <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6601,"text":"And those are the numbers out of which we're going to get all of our approximations to the integral.","entities":[{"id":1200,"label":"method","start_offset":91,"end_offset":99}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6602,"text":"So somehow we want average these numbers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6603,"text":"So here's our goal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6604,"text":"Our goal is to average, or add, I'm using average very loosely here.","entities":[{"id":1201,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6606,"text":"To average or add the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1205,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6608,"text":"Which we know is the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6610,"text":"It's the following thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6615,"text":"And you multiply by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1210,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6616,"text":"That's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6617,"text":"Now, this <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> with left endpoints.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6618,"text":"So the left-hand sum.","entities":[{"id":1212,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":7,"end_offset":16},{"id":1213,"label":"method","start_offset":17,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6620,"text":"Which is, if you start at the right-hand ends.","entities":[{"id":1215,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6634,"text":"Although if they're curved, they miss by a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6635,"text":"So this is called the trapezoidal rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6637,"text":"This is a trapezoid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6638,"text":"So this being a trapezoid, I can figure out its area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6639,"text":"And what do I get?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6641,"text":"If you think about if, you work out what happens when you do something with a straight line on top, like that, you'll get this average.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6642,"text":"So this is the average height of the trapezoid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6643,"text":"And now I want to add up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6645,"text":"So what do I do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6646,"text":"I have <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1219,"label":"command","start_offset":20,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6647,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6648,"text":"That's the <EXPRESSION> trapezoid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6650,"text":"And this keeps on going.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6651,"text":"And at the end, I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6652,"text":"And then last of all, I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6653,"text":"That's a very long formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6654,"text":"We're going to simplify it quite a bit in just a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1220,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6655,"text":"What's this =?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6656,"text":"Well, notice that I get <EXPRESSION> to start out with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6657,"text":"And now, <EXPRESSION> got mentioned twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6658,"text":"Each time with a factor of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6659,"text":"So we get a whole <EXPRESSION> in here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6660,"text":"And the same thing is going to be true of all the middle terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6662,"text":"But then, the last <EXPRESSION> is unmatched.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6664,"text":"So here is what's known as the trapezoidal rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6665,"text":"Now, I'd like to compare it for you to the Riemann sums, which are sitting just to the left here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6666,"text":"Here's the left <EXPRESSION>, and here's the right <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6675,"text":"If you actually do it in practice, it's not very efficient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6676,"text":"Although it's way better than a Riemann sum, it's still not good enough.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6677,"text":"So now I need to describe to you the fancier rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6681,"text":"But now it always needs n to be even.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6683,"text":"Here's delta <EXPRESSION>, and here's delta <EXPRESSION> again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6684,"text":"And we're going to study the area of this piece here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6685,"text":"So let me focus just on that part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6686,"text":"Let's reproduce it over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6688,"text":"And of course there are various heights.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6695,"text":"They don't switch.","entities":[{"id":1227,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6891,"text":"And, of course, in order to do that, I need more information than just where we start and where we end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6892,"text":"I also need the bottom and the top.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6894,"text":"And we have a notation for this, which is the notation using calculus for this as opposed to some geometric notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6895,"text":"And that's the following expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6896,"text":"It's called an integral, but now it's going to have what are known as limits on it.","entities":[{"id":1331,"label":"method","start_offset":15,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6899,"text":"So this is what's known as a definite integral.","entities":[{"id":1333,"label":"method","start_offset":38,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6900,"text":"And it's interpreted geometrically as the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6902,"text":"Now, in order to understand what to do with this guy, I'm going to just describe very abstractly what we do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6904,"text":"So, to compute this area, we're going to follow initially <EXPRESSION> steps.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6905,"text":"<EXPRESSION> of all, we're going to divide into rectangles.","entities":[{"id":1334,"label":"command","start_offset":36,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6909,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing we're going to do is to add up the areas.","entities":[{"id":1335,"label":"command","start_offset":51,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6910,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> thing we're going to do is to rectify this problem that we didn't actually hit the answer on the nose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6911,"text":"That we were missing some pieces or were choosing some extra bits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6912,"text":"And the way we'll rectify that is by taking the limit as the rectangles get thin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6913,"text":"Infinitesimally thin, very thin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6914,"text":"Pictorially, again, that looks like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6916,"text":"And I'm going to chop it up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6917,"text":"<EXPRESSION> I'm going to chop up the <EXPRESSION> axis into little increments.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6918,"text":"And then I'm going to chop things up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6919,"text":"And I'll decide on some rectangle, maybe some staircase pattern here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6920,"text":"Like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6921,"text":"Now, I don't care so much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6922,"text":"In some cases the rectangles overshoot; in some cases they're underneath.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6923,"text":"So the new area that I'm adding up is off.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6924,"text":"It's not quite the same as the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6925,"text":"It's this region here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6926,"text":"But it includes these extra bits here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6927,"text":"And then it's missing this little guy here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6928,"text":"This little bit there is missing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6929,"text":"And, as I say, these little pieces up here, this a little bit up here is extra.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6930,"text":"So that's why we're not really dividing up the region into rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6931,"text":"We're just taking rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6933,"text":"And they're going to be negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6934,"text":"Already, you can see it's kind of a thin piece of area, so we're not missing by much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6936,"text":"So here's our <EXPRESSION> example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6939,"text":"And to make things easier for myself, I'm going to start at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":6942,"text":"So here's the parabola, and there's this piece that we want, which is going to stop at this place, <EXPRESSION>, here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6944,"text":"That means, well, graphically, I'll just mark the <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6945,"text":"And maybe there are going to be many of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6947,"text":"That is, I'll make us this staircase pattern here, like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6948,"text":"That's my choice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6950,"text":"So I'm overshooting with each rectangle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6951,"text":"And now I have to write down formulas for what these areas are.","entities":[{"id":1342,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6952,"text":"Now, there's <EXPRESSION> big advantage that rectangles have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6953,"text":"And this is the starting place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6954,"text":"Which is that it's easy to find their areas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6956,"text":"That's the reason why we can get started with rectangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6957,"text":"And in this case, these distances, I'm assuming that they're all =, equally spaced, intervals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6958,"text":"And I'll always be doing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6959,"text":"And so the spacing, the bases, the base length, is always <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6960,"text":"All = intervals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6961,"text":"So that's the base length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6962,"text":"And next, I need the heights.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6978,"text":"Well, my next job is to add up these areas.","entities":[{"id":1344,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6979,"text":"And I've already prepared that by finding out what the base and the height is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6981,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6982,"text":"I'm sorry, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6983,"text":"And it just keeps on going.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6984,"text":"And the last <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6985,"text":"So it's very important to figure out what the general formula is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6986,"text":"And here we have a base.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6988,"text":"And so forth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6991,"text":"OK, this is a very complicated gadget.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6992,"text":"and the <EXPRESSION> thing I want to do is simplify it and then I'm actually going to evaluate it.","entities":[{"id":1345,"label":"command","start_offset":43,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6993,"text":"But actually I'm not going to evaluate it exactly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6994,"text":"I'm just going to evaluate the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6995,"text":"Turns out, limits are always easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6996,"text":"The point about calculus here is that these rectangles are hard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6997,"text":"But the limiting value is an easy value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6998,"text":"So what we're heading for is the simple formula, as opposed to the complicated <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":6999,"text":"Alright, so the <EXPRESSION> thing I'm going to do is factor out all these <EXPRESSION> factors.","entities":[{"id":1346,"label":"command","start_offset":54,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7007,"text":"OK, is everybody with me here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7012,"text":"Which is that I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>, just to see that there's a general pattern here.","entities":[{"id":1348,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7014,"text":"And let's put in the <EXPRESSION> here, why not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7015,"text":"And now I want to use a trick.","entities":[{"id":1350,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7016,"text":"This trick is not completely recommended, but I will say a lot more about that when we get through to the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7017,"text":"I want to understand how big this quantity is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7019,"text":"Namely, I'm going to build a pyramid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7028,"text":"Now, this is, if you like, the top view.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7029,"text":"But perhaps we should also think in terms of a side view.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7030,"text":"So here's the same picture, we're starting at n and we build up this layer here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7031,"text":"And now we're going to put a layer on top of it, which is a little shorter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7034,"text":"And we're going to pile them up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7035,"text":"So we pile them up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7036,"text":"All the way to the top, which is just <EXPRESSION> giant block of stone.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7039,"text":"And so I have to build this whole thing up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7040,"text":"And I get all the way up in this staircase pattern to this top block, up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7041,"text":"So here's the trick that you can use to estimate the size of this, and it's sufficient in the limit as n goes to infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7078,"text":"And now I'm ready to take the limit.","entities":[{"id":1358,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7079,"text":"If you look at what our goal is, we want to have an expression like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7080,"text":"And I'm going to This was the massive expression that we had.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7093,"text":"And that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7094,"text":"And now, I claim we're done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7096,"text":"So this also goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7100,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7101,"text":"That's the result from this whole computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7102,"text":"Yes, question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7103,"text":"The question is, why did we leave the <EXPRESSION> out, for this step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7104,"text":"And a part of the answer is malice aforethought.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7105,"text":"In other words, we know what we're heading for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7106,"text":"We know, we understand, this quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7107,"text":"It's all <EXPRESSION> thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7109,"text":"It's not what's called a closed form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7110,"text":"So, the thing that's not known, or not well understood, is how big is this quantity here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7112,"text":"Whereas, this is something that's quite easy to understand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7113,"text":"So we factor it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7114,"text":"And we analyze carefully the piece which we don't know yet, how big it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7115,"text":"And we discovered that it's very, very similar to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7116,"text":"But it's more similar to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7117,"text":"It's almost identical to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7118,"text":"This extra piece here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7119,"text":"So that's what's going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7120,"text":"And then we match that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7121,"text":"Since this thing is very similar to <EXPRESSION> we cancel the <EXPRESSION> and we have our result.","entities":[{"id":1369,"label":"command","start_offset":52,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7123,"text":"You always factor out whatever you can.","entities":[{"id":1371,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7126,"text":"OK, now I want to say <EXPRESSION> more word about notation.","entities":[{"id":1374,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7127,"text":"Which is that this notation is an extreme nuisance here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7128,"text":"And it's really sort of too large for us to deal with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7129,"text":"And so, mathematicians have a shorthand for it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7130,"text":"Unfortunately, when you actually do a computation, you're going to end up with this collection of stuff anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7131,"text":"But I want to just show you this summation notation in order to compress it a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7132,"text":"The idea of summation notation is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7133,"text":"So this thing tends The ideas are the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7137,"text":"And this is a capital sigma.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7139,"text":"So that's what this thing =.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7141,"text":"So this is the way the summation notation is used.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7142,"text":"There's a formula for each of these coefficients, each of these entries here, or summands.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7144,"text":"And this is the reason why I stuck in that <EXPRESSION> at the beginning, so that you could see that the pattern worked all the way down to <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7145,"text":"It isn't an exception to the rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7146,"text":"It's the same as all of the others.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7147,"text":"Now, over here, in this board, we also had <EXPRESSION> of these extremely long sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7148,"text":"And this <EXPRESSION> can be written in the following way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7149,"text":"And I hope you agree, this is rather hard to scan.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7151,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7152,"text":"So that's a way of abbreviating this massive formula into <EXPRESSION> which is just a lot shorter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7153,"text":"And now, the manipulation that I performed with it, which is to factor out this <EXPRESSION>, is something that I'm perfectly well allowed to do also over here.","entities":[{"id":1378,"label":"command","start_offset":64,"end_offset":74}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7154,"text":"This is the distributive law.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7156,"text":"So these notations make it a little bit more compact.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7157,"text":"What we're dealing with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7158,"text":"The conceptual phenomenon is still the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7159,"text":"And the mess is really still just hiding under the rug.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7160,"text":"But the notation is at least fits with fewer symbols, anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7161,"text":"So let's continue here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7162,"text":"I've given you <EXPRESSION> calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7163,"text":"And now I want to fit it into a pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7164,"text":"And here's the thing that I'd like to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7166,"text":"I'll do <EXPRESSION> more examples, but they're going to be much, much easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7167,"text":"And then things are going to get much easier from now on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7168,"text":"So, the <EXPRESSION> example is going to be the function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7170,"text":"And here's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7171,"text":"And so this area here is the same as the area of the triangle with <EXPRESSION> <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7172,"text":"So the <EQUATION>, so this is the base.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7173,"text":"And this is the height.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7174,"text":"We also know how to find the area of triangles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7175,"text":"And so, the formula is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7176,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> example Notice, by the way, I didn't have to do this elaborate summing to do that, because we happen to know this area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7177,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> example is going to be even easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7178,"text":"<EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7179,"text":"By far the most important example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7180,"text":"Remarkably, when you get to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7181,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, multivariable calculus, you will forget this calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7182,"text":"Somehow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7183,"text":"And I don't know why, but it happens to everybody.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7184,"text":"So, the function is just horizontal, like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7185,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7186,"text":"It's the constant <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7187,"text":"And if we stop it at <EXPRESSION>, then the area we're interested in is just this, from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7188,"text":"And we know that this is height <EXPRESSION>, so this is area is base, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1385,"label":"command","start_offset":94,"end_offset":99}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7189,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7190,"text":"Let's look now at the pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7191,"text":"We're going to look at the pattern of the function, and it's the area under the curve, which is this has this elaborate formula in terms of so this is just the area under the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7192,"text":"Between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7193,"text":"And we have <EXPRESSION>, which turned out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7195,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7196,"text":"And then we have <EXPRESSION>, which turned out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7197,"text":"So this, I claim, is suggestive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7198,"text":"If you can figure out the pattern, <EXPRESSION> way of making it a little clearer is to see that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7199,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7200,"text":"So this is the case, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7201,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7208,"text":"And he used, actually, a much more complicated method than I just described here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7209,"text":"And his method, which is just fantastically amazing, was so brilliant that it may have set back mathematics by <EXPRESSION> years.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7210,"text":"Because people were so it was so difficult that people couldn't see this pattern.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7211,"text":"And couldn't see that, actually, these kinds of calculations are easy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7212,"text":"So they couldn't get to the cubic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7213,"text":"And even when they got to the cubic, they were struggling with everything else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7214,"text":"And it wasn't until calculus fit everything together that people were able to make serious progress on calculating these areas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7215,"text":"Even though he was the expert on calculating areas and volumes, for his time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7216,"text":"So this is really a great thing that we now can have easy methods of doing it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7217,"text":"And the main thing that I want to tell you is that's we will not have to labor to build pyramids to calculate all of these quantities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7218,"text":"We will have a way faster way of doing it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7219,"text":"This is the slow, laborious way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7220,"text":"And we will be able to do it so easily that it will happen as fast as you differentiate.","entities":[{"id":1390,"label":"command","start_offset":74,"end_offset":87}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7221,"text":"So that's coming up tomorrow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7222,"text":"But I want you to know that it's going to be However, we're going to go through just a little pain before we do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7223,"text":"And I'll just tell you <EXPRESSION> more piece of notation here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7224,"text":"So you need to have a little practice just to recognize how much savings we're going to make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7225,"text":"But never again will you have to face elaborate geometric arguments like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7226,"text":"So let me just add a little bit of notation for definite integrals.","entities":[{"id":1391,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7227,"text":"And this goes under the name of Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7229,"text":"So this is the general procedure for definite integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7230,"text":"We divide it up into pieces.","entities":[{"id":1392,"label":"command","start_offset":3,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7231,"text":"And how do we do that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7232,"text":"Well, so here's our <EXPRESSION> and here's our <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7233,"text":"And what we're going to do is break it up into little pieces.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7234,"text":"And we're going to give a name to the increment.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7235,"text":"And we're going to call that <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7236,"text":"So we divide up into these.","entities":[{"id":1393,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7237,"text":"So how many pieces are there?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7239,"text":"So it has to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7241,"text":"We will, for these Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7242,"text":"And now there's only <EXPRESSION> bit of flexibility that we will allow ourselves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7243,"text":"Which is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7245,"text":"So what that means is, let me just show it to you on the picture here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7247,"text":"And then I go up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7248,"text":"And I have the level, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7249,"text":"And that's the rectangle that I choose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7251,"text":"But I could've chosen some level in between.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7253,"text":"Which would have meant that the staircase would've been quite a bit lower.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7254,"text":"So any of these staircases will work perfectly well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7256,"text":"And now we're just going to add them all up.","entities":[{"id":1394,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7258,"text":"And this is the base.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7259,"text":"This notation is supposed to be, now, very suggestive of the notation that Leibniz used.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7260,"text":"Which is that in the limit, this becomes an integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1396,"label":"method","start_offset":44,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7261,"text":"And notice that the <EXPRESSION> gets replaced by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7262,"text":"So this is what happens in the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7263,"text":"As the rectangles get thin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7264,"text":"So that's as delta <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7265,"text":"And these gadgets are called Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7266,"text":"This is called a Riemann sum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7267,"text":"And we already worked out an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7268,"text":"This very complicated guy was an example of a Riemann sum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7269,"text":"So that's a notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7270,"text":"And we'll give you a chance to get used to it a little more when we do some numerical work at the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7271,"text":"Now, the last thing for today is, I promised you an example which was not an area example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7272,"text":"I want to be able to show you that integrals can be interpreted as cumulative sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7273,"text":"Integrals as cumulative sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7274,"text":"So this is just an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7275,"text":"And, so here's the way it goes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7276,"text":"So we're going to consider a function <EXPRESSION>, we're going to consider a variable <EXPRESSION>, which is time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7277,"text":"In years.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7278,"text":"And we'll consider a function <EXPRESSION>, which is in dollars per year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7279,"text":"Right, this is a financial example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7281,"text":"And this is going to be a borrowing rate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7284,"text":"It allows us to change variables, it allows this to be consistent with units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7285,"text":"And allows us to develop meaningful formulas, which are consistent across the board.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7286,"text":"And so I want to emphasize the units in this when I set up this modeling problem here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7288,"text":"So that means <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7289,"text":"That's almost <EXPRESSION>, from the point of view of various purposes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7290,"text":"So this is how much you're borrowing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7291,"text":"In each time increment you're borrowing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7293,"text":"I mean, sometimes you need more money sometimes you need less.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7294,"text":"Certainly any business would be that way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7295,"text":"And so here you are, you've got your money.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7296,"text":"And you're borrowing but the rate is varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7297,"text":"And so how much did you borrow?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7300,"text":"So, dollars per year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7301,"text":"And so this is, if you like I want to emphasize the scaling that comes about here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7302,"text":"You have dollars per year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7303,"text":"And this is this number of years.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7304,"text":"So that comes out to be in dollars.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7305,"text":"This final amount.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7306,"text":"This is the amount that you actually borrow.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7307,"text":"So you borrow this amount.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7312,"text":"This is total amount borrowed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7313,"text":"This is kind of a messy sum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7314,"text":"In fact, your bank probably will keep track of it and they know how to do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7316,"text":"And how much you spend, and how much you invest.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7318,"text":"At the scale of <EXPRESSION>, it's probably <EXPRESSION>, it's probably enough for many purposes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7319,"text":"Now, however, there's another thing that you would want to model.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7320,"text":"Which is equally important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7321,"text":"This is how much you borrowed, but there's also how much you owe the back at the end of the year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7322,"text":"And the amount that you owe the bank at the end of the year, I'm going to do it in a fancy way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7323,"text":"It's, the interest, we'll say, is compounded continuously.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7326,"text":"<EXPRESSION> per year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7328,"text":"And so, if you want to understand how much money you actually owe at the end of the year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7329,"text":"At the end of the year what you owe is, well, you borrowed these amounts here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7330,"text":"But now you owe more at the end of the year.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7334,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7335,"text":"And this is what you have to add up, to see how much you owe.","entities":[{"id":1412,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7336,"text":"And that is essentially the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1413,"label":"method","start_offset":28,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7339,"text":"And so when you start computing and thinking about what's the right strategy, you're faced with integrals of this type.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7340,"text":"So that's just an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7341,"text":"And see you next time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7342,"text":"Remember to think about questions that you'll ask next time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7343,"text":"In today's lecture I want to develop several more formulas that will allow us to reach our goal of differentiating everything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7344,"text":"So these are derivative formulas, and they come in <EXPRESSION> flavors.","entities":[{"id":1415,"label":"method","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7345,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> kind is specific, so some specific function we're giving the derivative of.","entities":[{"id":1416,"label":"method","start_offset":78,"end_offset":88}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7346,"text":"And that would be, for example, <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7347,"text":"Those are the ones that we did a couple of lectures ago.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7350,"text":"All right, so these kinds of formulas are very useful, both the specific and the general kind.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7351,"text":"For example, we need both kinds for polynomials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7353,"text":"So today, we wanna concentrate on the trig functions, and so we'll start out with some specific formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7354,"text":"And they're going to be the formulas for the derivative of the sine function and the cosine function.","entities":[{"id":1423,"label":"method","start_offset":45,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7356,"text":"Alright, so in order to calculate these, I'm gonna start over here and just start the calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7357,"text":"So here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7358,"text":"Let's check what happens with the <EXPRESSION> function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7359,"text":"So, I take <EXPRESSION>, I subtract <EXPRESSION> and I divide by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1426,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":35},{"id":1427,"label":"command","start_offset":55,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7360,"text":"Right, so this is the difference quotient and eventually I'm gonna have to take the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1428,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5},{"id":1429,"label":"method","start_offset":22,"end_offset":32},{"id":1430,"label":"command","start_offset":75,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7361,"text":"And there's really only <EXPRESSION> thing we can do with this to simplify or change it, and that is to use the sum formula for the sine function.","entities":[{"id":1431,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":74},{"id":1432,"label":"command","start_offset":104,"end_offset":107}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7362,"text":"So, that's this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7363,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION> Oh, that's not what it is?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7364,"text":"OK, so what is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7365,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7366,"text":"OK, good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7367,"text":"Plus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1434,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":4}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7368,"text":"No?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7369,"text":"Oh, OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7370,"text":"So which is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7371,"text":"OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7372,"text":"Alright, let's take a vote.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7373,"text":"Is it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, or is it <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7374,"text":"All right, you better remember these formulas, alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7375,"text":"OK, turns out that it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7376,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7377,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7378,"text":"So here we go, no gotta do <EXPRESSION> here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7380,"text":"Alright, so we're gonna put those in parentheses here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7381,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7383,"text":"Now that's just the <EXPRESSION> part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7384,"text":"That's just this part of the expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7385,"text":"I still have to remember the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7386,"text":"That comes at the end.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7387,"text":"<EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7388,"text":"And then, I have to remember the denominator, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1441,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":33,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7389,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7390,"text":"Alright, so now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7414,"text":"It's the easiest number to deal with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7415,"text":"So this goes to <EXPRESSION>, and that's what happens as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7416,"text":"How about this <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7417,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, my <EXPRESSION> favorite number, almost as easy to deal with as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7418,"text":"And these things are picked for a reason.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7419,"text":"They're the simplest numbers to deal with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7420,"text":"So altogether, this thing as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> goes to what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7421,"text":"I want a single person to answer, a brave volunteer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7422,"text":"Alright, back there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7423,"text":"It cancels and this factor has a <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7424,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7426,"text":"OK, now I still wanna label these very important limit facts here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7428,"text":"I promised you I would do that, and I'll have to do that this time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7429,"text":"So we're relying on those things being true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7430,"text":"Now I'm gonna do the same thing with the cosine function, except in order to do it I'm gonna have to remember the sum rule for cosine.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7431,"text":"So we're gonna do almost the same calculation here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7432,"text":"We're gonna see that that will work out, but now you have to remember that <EQUATION>, no it's not <EXPRESSION>, because there are <EXPRESSION> different quantities here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7433,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7434,"text":"All right, so you'll have to be willing to call those forth at will right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7435,"text":"So let's do the <EXPRESSION> now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7436,"text":"So that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7437,"text":"OK, there's the difference quotient for the <EXPRESSION> function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7438,"text":"And now I'm gonna do the same thing I did before except I'm going to apply the <EXPRESSION> rule, that is the sum rule for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1445,"label":"command","start_offset":69,"end_offset":74}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7439,"text":"And that's gonna give me <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7440,"text":"And I have to remember again to subtract the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1443,"label":"method","start_offset":32,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7441,"text":"And now I'm going to regroup just the way I did before, and I get the common factor of <EXPRESSION> multiplying <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7442,"text":"And here I get the <EXPRESSION> but actually it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7443,"text":"And then I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7444,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7445,"text":"The only difference is this minus sign which I stuck inside there.","entities":[{"id":1448,"label":"command","start_offset":28,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7446,"text":"Well that's not the only difference, but it's a crucial difference.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7447,"text":"OK, again by <EXPRESSION> we get that this is <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7448,"text":"And this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7449,"text":"Those are the properties I called <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7450,"text":"And so the result here as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION> is that we get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7451,"text":"That's the factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7452,"text":"So this guy is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7453,"text":"I'll put a little box around that too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7455,"text":"So we'll get ourselves started by mentioning that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7456,"text":"Maybe before I do that though, I want to show you how <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> fit into the proofs of these theorems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7457,"text":"So, let me just make some remarks here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7458,"text":"So this is just a remark but it's meant to help you to frame how these proofs worked.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7460,"text":"If I take the rate of change of <EXPRESSION>, so in other words this derivative at <EQUATION>, then by definition this is a certain limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1455,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":9},{"id":1456,"label":"method","start_offset":69,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7461,"text":"So which <EXPRESSION> is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7463,"text":"And I have to subtract <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1457,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7464,"text":"That's the base point, but that's just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7465,"text":"And then I have to divide by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1458,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7466,"text":"And lo and behold you can see that this is exactly the limit that we had over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7467,"text":"This is the <EXPRESSION> that we know is <EXPRESSION> by what we call property <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7468,"text":"And similarly, if I take the derivative of <EQUATION>, then that's going to be the limit as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1459,"label":"command","start_offset":20,"end_offset":24},{"id":1460,"label":"method","start_offset":29,"end_offset":39}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":7471,"text":"So this is going to be <EXPRESSION> by our property <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7474,"text":"So that's really what this argument is showing us, is that we just need <EXPRESSION> rate of change at <EXPRESSION> place and then we work out all the rest of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7475,"text":"So that's really the substance of this proof.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7476,"text":"That of course really then shows that it boils down to showing what this rate of change is in these <EXPRESSION> cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7477,"text":"So now there's enough suspense that we want to make sure that we know that those answers are correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7478,"text":"OK, so let's demonstrate both of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7479,"text":"I'll start with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7480,"text":"I need to figure out property <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7482,"text":"So we have to give a geometric proof.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7483,"text":"And to write down a geometric proof we are going to have to draw a picture.","entities":[{"id":1461,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":12},{"id":1462,"label":"command","start_offset":60,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7485,"text":"OK, so let's draw a picture of what it is that we're going to do.","entities":[{"id":1463,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7486,"text":"Here is the circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7487,"text":"And here is the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7488,"text":"And here's some little angle, well I'll draw it a little larger so it's visible.","entities":[{"id":1464,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7489,"text":"Here's theta, alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7490,"text":"And this is the unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7491,"text":"I won't write that down on here but that's the unit circle.","entities":[{"id":1465,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7492,"text":"And now sin theta is this vertical distance here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7493,"text":"Maybe, I'll draw it in a different color so that we can see it all.","entities":[{"id":1466,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7494,"text":"OK so here's this distance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7495,"text":"This distance is sin theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7496,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7499,"text":"That little piece in there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7501,"text":"So that's orange and that's this little chunk there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7503,"text":"Now in order to persuade you now that the limit is what it's supposed to be, I'm going to extend the picture just a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7505,"text":"Alright, so that you'll remember this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7507,"text":"And now the total picture is really like a bow and its bow string there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7508,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7509,"text":"So what we have here is a length of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7510,"text":"So maybe I'll write it this way, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1469,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7511,"text":"I just doubled it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7512,"text":"And here I have underneath, whoops, I got it backwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7513,"text":"Sorry about that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7514,"text":"Trying to be fancy with the colored chalk and I have it reversed here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7515,"text":"So this is not <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7516,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is the vertical.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7517,"text":"That's the green.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7518,"text":"So let's try that again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7519,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7521,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7522,"text":"So if you like, this is the bow and up here we have the bow string.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7523,"text":"And of course we can cancel the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1470,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7524,"text":"That's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7525,"text":"And so now why does this tend to <EXPRESSION> as theta goes to <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7526,"text":"Well, it's because as the angle theta gets very small, this curved piece looks more and more like a straight <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7527,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7528,"text":"And if you get very, very close here the green segment and the orange segment would just merge.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7529,"text":"They would be practically on top of each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7530,"text":"And they have closer and closer and closer to the same length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7531,"text":"So that's why this is true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7532,"text":"I guess I'll articulate that by saying that short curves are nearly straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7533,"text":"Alright, so that's the principle that we're using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7534,"text":"Or short pieces of curves, if you like, are nearly straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7535,"text":"So if you like, this is the principle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7536,"text":"So short pieces of curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7537,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7538,"text":"So now I also need to give you a proof of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7540,"text":"This is the property <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7542,"text":"If I want to interpret it as a length, I'm gonna want a positive quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7543,"text":"So I'm gonna write down <EXPRESSION> here and then I'm gonna divide by <EXPRESSION> there.","entities":[{"id":1472,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18},{"id":1473,"label":"command","start_offset":61,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7544,"text":"Again I'm gonna make some kind of interpretation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7545,"text":"Now this time I'm going to draw the same sort of bow and arrow arrangement, but maybe I'll exaggerate it a little bit.","entities":[{"id":1474,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7546,"text":"So here's the vertex of the sector, but we'll maybe make it a little longer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7547,"text":"Alright, so here it is, and here was that middle line which was the unit Whoops.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7548,"text":"OK, I think I'm going to have to tilt it up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7549,"text":"OK, let's try from here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7550,"text":"Alright, well you know on your pencil and paper it will look better than it does on my blackboard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7551,"text":"OK, so here we are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7552,"text":"Here's this shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7553,"text":"Now this angle is supposed to be theta and this angle is another theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7555,"text":"That's the same as in the other picture, except we've exaggerated a bit here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7556,"text":"And now we have this vertical line, which again I'm gonna draw in green, the bow string.","entities":[{"id":1475,"label":"command","start_offset":58,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7557,"text":"But notice that as the vertex gets farther and farther away, the curved line gets closer and closer to being a vertical line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7558,"text":"That's sort of the flip side, by expansion, of the zoom in principle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7559,"text":"The principle that curves are nearly straight when you zoom in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7560,"text":"If you zoom out that would mean sending this vertex way, way out somewhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7561,"text":"The curved line, the piece of the circle, gets more and more straight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7562,"text":"And now let me show you where this numerator <EXPRESSION> is on this picture.","entities":[{"id":1476,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":35,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7563,"text":"So where is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7564,"text":"Well, this whole distance is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7565,"text":"But the distance from the vertex to the green is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7567,"text":"So this little tiny, bitty segment here is basically the gap between the curve and the vertical segment.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7568,"text":"So the gap = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7570,"text":"The bow string would coincide with the bow and this little gap between the bow string and the bow would be tending to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7571,"text":"And that's the statement that this tends to <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7572,"text":"The scaled version of that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7573,"text":"Yeah, question down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7574,"text":"And the answer is yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7575,"text":"In my strange analogy with zooming in, what I did was I zoomed out the picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7577,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7578,"text":"But now because I want my picture, I expanded my picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7579,"text":"So the ratio is the thing that's preserved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7580,"text":"So if I make it so that this gap is tiny.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7583,"text":"Let me say this <EXPRESSION> more time.","entities":[{"id":1478,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":10}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7584,"text":"I'm afraid I've made life complicated for myself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7586,"text":"But I want to keep on blowing up the picture so that I can see the difference between the vertical and the curve.","entities":[{"id":1479,"label":"method","start_offset":67,"end_offset":77}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7587,"text":"So that's very much like if you are on a video screen and you zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, and zoom in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7588,"text":"So the question is what would that look like?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7589,"text":"That has the same effect as sending this point out farther and farther in that direction, to the left.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7591,"text":"So theta is going to <EXPRESSION>, but I I'm rescaling so that it's of a size that we can look at it, And then imagine what's happening to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7592,"text":"OK, does that answer your question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7595,"text":"It's the ratio of this little short thing to this longer thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7596,"text":"And this is getting much, much shorter than this total length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7599,"text":"Here the previous <EXPRESSION> was this green <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7600,"text":"Here it's this little tiny bit here and it's way shorter than the <EXPRESSION> distance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7601,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7602,"text":"Here, I wrote minus that, that is I replaced <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":1482,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7603,"text":"But then I wrote this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7604,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is the negative of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7605,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7606,"text":"And if I show that this goes to <EXPRESSION>, it's the same as showing the other <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7607,"text":"Another question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7611,"text":"Ah, OK so this is a very important point, and in fact it's the very next point that I wanted to make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7612,"text":"Namely, notice that in this calculation it was very important that we used length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7613,"text":"And that means that the way that we're measuring theta, is in what are known as radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7616,"text":"If we measure them in degrees, for example, it would be completely wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7618,"text":"The correct measure is the length along the unit circle, which is what radians are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7619,"text":"And so this is only true if we use radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7620,"text":"So again, a little warning here, that this is in radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7621,"text":"Now here <EXPRESSION> is in radians.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7622,"text":"The formulas are just wrong if you use other units.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7623,"text":"Ah yeah?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7624,"text":"And the reason is that the relationship between this picture up here and this picture down here, is that I'm drawing a different shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7625,"text":"Namely, what I'm really imagining here is a much, much smaller theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7626,"text":"OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7627,"text":"And then I'm blowing that up in scale.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7628,"text":"So this scale of this picture down here is very different from the scale of the picture up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7629,"text":"And if the angle is very, very, very small then <EXPRESSION> has to be very, very long in order for me to finish the circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7630,"text":"So, in other words, this length is <EXPRESSION> because that's what I'm insisting on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7632,"text":"Another question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7633,"text":"So let me, let me take you through a couple of steps, because I think probably other people are also having trouble with this visualization.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7634,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization I'm gonna try to demonstrate on this picture up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7635,"text":"The <EXPRESSION> part of the visualization is that I should think of a beak of a bird closing down, getting narrower and narrower.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7636,"text":"So in other words, the angle theta has to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7637,"text":"OK, that's the <EXPRESSION> step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7638,"text":"So that's the process that we're talking about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7640,"text":"Otherwise it just disappears on me.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7641,"text":"In fact in the limit <EQUATION>, it's meaningless.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7642,"text":"It's just a flat line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7643,"text":"That's the whole problem with these tricky limits.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7645,"text":"It's only just a little away that they're actually useful, that you get useful geometric information out of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7646,"text":"So we're just a little away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7648,"text":"It's supposed to be that theta is open a tiny crack, just a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7650,"text":"So I've opened a little tiny bit and by the time we get to the other end of the blackboard, of course it's fairly wide.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7651,"text":"But this angle theta is a very small angle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7652,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7653,"text":"So I'm trying to imagine what happens as this collapses.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7654,"text":"Now, when I imagine that I have to imagine a geometric interpretation of both the numerator and the denominator of this quantity here.","entities":[{"id":1491,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":82,"end_offset":91},{"id":1492,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":100,"end_offset":111}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7655,"text":"And just see what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7656,"text":"Now I claimed the numerator is this little tiny bit over here and the denominator is actually half of this whole length here.","entities":[{"id":1493,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":18,"end_offset":27},{"id":1494,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":70,"end_offset":81}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7657,"text":"But the factor of <EXPRESSION> doesn't matter when you're seeing whether something tends to <EXPRESSION> or not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7658,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7659,"text":"And I claimed that if you stare at this, it's clear that this is much shorter than that vertical curve there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7661,"text":"And so that the gap between them gets tiny and goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7662,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7664,"text":"And I hope the evidence is pretty strong here because it's so tiny already at this stage.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7665,"text":"Alright.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7666,"text":"We are going to move forward and you'll have to ponder these things some other time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7667,"text":"So I'm gonna give you an even harder thing to visualize now so be prepared.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7668,"text":"OK, so now, the next thing that I'd like to do is to give you a <EXPRESSION> proof.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7669,"text":"Because it really is important, I think, to understand this particular fact more thoroughly and also to get a lot of practice with sines and cosines.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7670,"text":"So I'm gonna give you a geometric proof of the formula for sine here, for the derivative of sine.","entities":[{"id":1496,"label":"method","start_offset":78,"end_offset":88}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7671,"text":"So here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7672,"text":"This is a geometric proof of this fact.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7673,"text":"This is for all theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7674,"text":"So far we only did it for theta = <EXPRESSION> and now we're going to do it for all theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7675,"text":"So this is a different proof, but it uses exactly the same principles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7676,"text":"Right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7678,"text":"So I'm imagining that something is going around in a circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7679,"text":"Some particle is going around in a circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7680,"text":"And so here's the circle, here the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7681,"text":"This is the unit distance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7682,"text":"And right now it happens to be at this location P.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7683,"text":"Maybe we'll put P a little over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7684,"text":"And here's the angle theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7685,"text":"And now we're going to move it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7691,"text":"Here's the thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7692,"text":"So how far did we move it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7693,"text":"Well we moved it by an angle delta theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7694,"text":"So we started theta, theta is going to be fixed in this argument, and we're going to move a little bit delta theta.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7695,"text":"And now we're just gonna try to figure out how far the thing moved.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7696,"text":"Well, in order to do that we've got to keep track of the height, the vertical displacement here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7698,"text":"And then this distance here is the change in y.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7699,"text":"Alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7700,"text":"So the picture is we have something moving around a unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7701,"text":"A point moving around a unit circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7704,"text":"And the formula for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7705,"text":"So that's telling us the rate of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7706,"text":"Alright, well so let's just try to think a little bit about what this is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7707,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> of all, I've already said this and I'm going to repeat it here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":7708,"text":"<EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
