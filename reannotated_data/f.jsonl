{"id":227892,"text":"You have a question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227894,"text":"And the answer is absolutely yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227895,"text":"That's exactly the point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227896,"text":"So this is not a complete solution to a problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227897,"text":"We started with an implicit equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227898,"text":"We differentiated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227899,"text":"And we got in the end, also an implicit equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227900,"text":"It doesn't tell us what <EXPRESSION> is as a function of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227901,"text":"You have to go back to this formula to get the formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227902,"text":"So for example, let me give you an example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227903,"text":"So this hides a degree of complexity of the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227904,"text":"But it's a degree of complexity that we must live with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227905,"text":"So for example, at <EQUATION>, you can see that <EQUATION> solves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227906,"text":"That happens to be-- solves <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227907,"text":"That's why I picked the <EXPRESSION> actually, so it would be <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227908,"text":"I just wanted to have a convenient solution there to pull out of my hat at this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227909,"text":"So I did that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227910,"text":"And so we now know that when <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227912,"text":"Well, I have to plug in here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227913,"text":"That's just plugging in that formula over there, which turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227915,"text":"On the other hand, at say <EQUATION>, we're stuck using this formula star here to find <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91224,"label":"command","start_offset":22,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227916,"text":"Now, so let me just make two points about this, which are just philosophical points for you right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227921,"text":"That will never happen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227922,"text":"And however complex the function is, a root of a fourth degree polynomial can be pretty complicated function of the coefficients, we're stuck with this degree of complexity in the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227925,"text":"We had a fast way of getting the slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227926,"text":"So we had to know what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> were.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227927,"text":"But <EXPRESSION> we got by an algebraic formula, in terms of the values here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227929,"text":"Sorry, this is-- Well let's see if I can manage this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227930,"text":"Is this the parentheses you're talking about?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227931,"text":"Ah, say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227933,"text":"Well, so maybe I should put commas around it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227935,"text":"Well here was at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227936,"text":"I'm just throwing out a value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227937,"text":"Any other value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227938,"text":"Actually there is one value, my favorite value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227939,"text":"Well this is easy to evaluate right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227940,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, I can do it there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227941,"text":"That's maybe the only one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227942,"text":"The others are a nuisance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227943,"text":"All right, other questions?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227944,"text":"Now we have to do something more here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227945,"text":"So I claimed to you that we could differentiate all the functions we know.","entities":[{"id":91234,"label":"command","start_offset":34,"end_offset":47}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227946,"text":"But really we can learn a tremendous about functions which are really hard to get at.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227947,"text":"So this implicit differentiation method has one very, very important application to finding inverse functions, or finding derivatives of inverse functions.","entities":[{"id":91236,"label":"method","start_offset":17,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227948,"text":"So let's talk about that next.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227949,"text":"So first, maybe we'll just illustrate by an example.","entities":[{"id":91237,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":37}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227950,"text":"If you have the function <EXPRESSION>, for <EXPRESSION> positive, then of course this idea is that we should simplify this equation and we should square it so we get this somewhat simpler equation here.","entities":[{"id":91238,"label":"command","start_offset":109,"end_offset":117},{"id":91239,"label":"method","start_offset":146,"end_offset":152}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227952,"text":"If we call <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>, this is the reversal of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227953,"text":"Then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is that it should be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227961,"text":"That's some shape like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227968,"text":"Then that would be, in effect, trading the roles of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227971,"text":"So you want the y here right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227972,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> up there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227973,"text":"It's sort of the opposite place over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227978,"text":"So this guy here is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227980,"text":"This one happens to be <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227985,"text":"So let's do that for what is an example, which is truly complicated and a little subtle here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227986,"text":"It has a very pretty answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":227987,"text":"So we'll carry out an example here, which is the function <EXPRESSION> is = the inverse tangent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227995,"text":"So let's make the diagram first.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":227999,"text":"So that's the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228000,"text":"And so the one that we have to sketch is this one which we get by reflecting this across the axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228001,"text":"Well not the axis, the diagonal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228002,"text":"This slope by the way, should be less - a little lower here so that we can have it going down and up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228003,"text":"So let me show you what it looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228004,"text":"On the front, it's going to look a lot like this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228005,"text":"So this one had curved down, and so the reflection across the diagonal curved up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":228007,"text":"It's going to look like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228009,"text":"I'll just call it green.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228010,"text":"Now, the original curve in the first quadrant eventually had an asymptote which was straight up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228011,"text":"So this one is going to have an asymptote which is horizontal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228012,"text":"And that level is what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228013,"text":"What's the highest?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228014,"text":"It is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228015,"text":"Now similarly, the other way, we're going to do this: and this bottom level is going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":228017,"text":"It's defined for all <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":228028,"text":"But what you get in the end is some marvelous simplification that comes out to <EXPRESSION>.You can recognize <EXPRESSION> from the fact that you should get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator, and somehow the numerators all cancel and simplifies to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91282,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16},{"id":91284,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":177,"end_offset":188},{"id":91285,"label":"command","start_offset":221,"end_offset":227}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228029,"text":"This is also known as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":228209,"text":"Well, a tangent line has an equation, and any line through a point has the equation <EQUATION>, the slope, times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91392,"label":"command","start_offset":107,"end_offset":112}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228210,"text":"So here's the equation for that line, and now there are two pieces of information that we're going to need to work out what the line is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228211,"text":"The first one is the point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228212,"text":"That's that point <EXPRESSION> there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228213,"text":"And to specify <EXPRESSION>, given <EXPRESSION>, we need to know the level of <EXPRESSION>, which is of course just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228214,"text":"That's not a calculus problem, but anyway that's a very important part of the process.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228215,"text":"So that's the first thing we need to know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228216,"text":"And the second thing we need to know is the slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228217,"text":"And that's this number <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228218,"text":"And in calculus we have another name for it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228219,"text":"We call it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228220,"text":"Namely, the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91393,"label":"method","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228221,"text":"So that's the calculus part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228222,"text":"That's the tricky part, and that's the part that we have to discuss now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228223,"text":"So just to make that explicit here, I'm going to make a definition, which is that <EXPRESSION> , which is known as the derivative, of <EXPRESSION>, at <EXPRESSION>, is the slope of the tangent line to <EQUATION> at the point, let's just call it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91394,"label":"method","start_offset":119,"end_offset":129}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228224,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228225,"text":"So, that's what it is, but still I haven't made any progress in figuring out any better how I drew that line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228226,"text":"So I have to say something that's more concrete, because I want to be able to cook up what these numbers are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228227,"text":"I have to figure out what this number <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228228,"text":"And one way of thinking about that, let me just try this, so I certainly am taking for granted that in sort of non-calculus part that I know what a line through a point is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228229,"text":"So I know this equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228230,"text":"But another possibility might be, this line here, how do I know - well, unfortunately, I didn't draw it quite straight, but there it is - how do I know that this orange line is not a tangent line, but this other line is a tangent line?","entities":[{"id":91396,"label":"command","start_offset":96,"end_offset":100}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228231,"text":"Well, it's actually not so obvious, but I'm gonna describe it a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228232,"text":"It's not really the fact-- this thing crosses at some other place, which is this point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228233,"text":"But it's not really the fact that the thing crosses at two place, because the line could be wiggly, the curve could be wiggly, and it could cross back and forth a number of times.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228234,"text":"That's not what distinguishes the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228235,"text":"So I'm gonna have to somehow grasp this, and I'll first do it in language.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228237,"text":"And if we draw it close enough, then that's gonna be the correct line.","entities":[{"id":91400,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228238,"text":"So that's really what I did, sort of in my brain when I drew that first line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228239,"text":"And so that's the way I'm going to articulate it first.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228240,"text":"Now, so the tangent line is = the limit of so called secant lines <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228241,"text":"And here we're thinking of P as being fixed and <EXPRESSION> as variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228242,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228243,"text":"Again, this is still the geometric discussion, but now we're gonna be able to put symbols and formulas to this computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228244,"text":"And we'll be able to work out formulas in any example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228245,"text":"So let's do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228246,"text":"So first of all, I'm gonna write out these points <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> again.","entities":[{"id":91401,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228247,"text":"So maybe we'll put <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228248,"text":"And I'm thinking of this line through them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228249,"text":"I guess it was orange, so we'll leave it as orange.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228250,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228251,"text":"And now I want to compute its slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228252,"text":"So this, gradually, we'll do this in two steps.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228253,"text":"And these steps will introduce us to the basic notations which are used throughout calculus, including multi-variable calculus, across the board.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228254,"text":"So the first notation that's used is you imagine here's the x-axis underneath, and here's the <EXPRESSION>, the location directly below the point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228255,"text":"And we're traveling here a horizontal distance which is denoted by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228256,"text":"So that's <EXPRESSION>, so called.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228257,"text":"And we could also call it the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228259,"text":"And the other thing is this height.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228260,"text":"So that's this distance here, which we denote <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228261,"text":"And then, the slope is just the ratio, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228262,"text":"So this is the slope of the secant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228263,"text":"And the process I just described over here with this limit applies not just to the whole line itself, but also in particular to its slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228264,"text":"And the way we write that is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91404,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228265,"text":"And that's going to be our slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228266,"text":"So this is the slope of the tangent line.Now, This is still a little general, and I want to work out a more usable form here, a better formula for this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228267,"text":"And in order to do that, I'm gonna write <EXPRESSION>, the numerator more explicitly here.","entities":[{"id":91405,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":40},{"id":91406,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":59,"end_offset":68}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228269,"text":"All right, that's what we got for the formula for the point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228270,"text":"And in order to compute these distances and in particular the vertical distance here, I'm gonna have to get a formula for <EXPRESSION> as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228271,"text":"So if this horizontal distance is <EXPRESSION>, then this location is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228272,"text":"And so the point above that point has a formula, which is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> of - and this is a mouthful - <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228273,"text":"All right, so there's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228274,"text":"Here's the formula for the point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228276,"text":"All right, so this is the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228278,"text":"And this is the way that we're going to be able to compute these numbers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228279,"text":"So let's do an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228280,"text":"This example, we'll call this example one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228282,"text":"That's sufficiently complicated to have an interesting answer, and sufficiently straightforward that we can compute the derivative fairly quickly.","entities":[{"id":91417,"label":"method","start_offset":120,"end_offset":130}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228283,"text":"So what is it that we're gonna do here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228284,"text":"All we're going to do is we're going to plug in this formula here for that function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228286,"text":"That's what we're accomplishing when we do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228287,"text":"So we're accomplishing this geometrically but we'll be doing it algebraically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228288,"text":"So first, we consider this difference <EXPRESSION> and write out its formula.","entities":[{"id":91421,"label":"command","start_offset":55,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228289,"text":"So I have to have a place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228290,"text":"So I'm gonna make it again above this point <EXPRESSION>, which is the general point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228291,"text":"We'll make the general calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228293,"text":"The formula, the first thing I get here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228296,"text":"And then I have to divide that by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91426,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228297,"text":"OK, so here's our expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228298,"text":"And by the way this has a name.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228302,"text":"OK, so now we're going to simplify it by some algebra.","entities":[{"id":91435,"label":"command","start_offset":26,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228303,"text":"So let's just take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228304,"text":"So this =, let's continue on the next level here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228305,"text":"This = <EXPRESSION>.All I'm going to do is put it over a common denominator.","entities":[{"id":91437,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":64,"end_offset":75}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228306,"text":"So the common denominator is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91438,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":14,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228307,"text":"And so in the numerator for the first expressions I have <EXPRESSION>, and for the second expression I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91439,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":14,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228308,"text":"So this is the same thing as I had in the numerator before, factoring out this denominator.","entities":[{"id":91440,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":42,"end_offset":51},{"id":91441,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":79,"end_offset":90}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228309,"text":"And here I put that numerator into this more amenable form.","entities":[{"id":91442,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":20,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228310,"text":"And now there are two basic cancellations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228311,"text":"The first one is that <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel, so we have this.","entities":[{"id":91443,"label":"command","start_offset":52,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228312,"text":"And then the second step is that these two expressions cancel, the numerator and the denominator.","entities":[{"id":91444,"label":"command","start_offset":55,"end_offset":61},{"id":91445,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":67,"end_offset":76},{"id":91446,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":85,"end_offset":96}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228313,"text":"Now we have a cancellation that we can make use of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228314,"text":"So we'll write that under here.","entities":[{"id":91448,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228315,"text":"And this is = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228317,"text":"Before we couldn't do it.Because the numerator and the denominator gave us <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91450,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":37,"end_offset":46},{"id":91451,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":55,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228318,"text":"But now that I've made this cancellation, I can pass to the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228319,"text":"And all that happens is I set this <EXPRESSION>, and I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91452,"label":"command","start_offset":26,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228320,"text":"So that's the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228321,"text":"All right, so in other words what I've shown - let me put it up here - is that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228323,"text":"What's happening here is, first of all it's negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228324,"text":"It's less than <EXPRESSION>, which is a good thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228325,"text":"You see that slope there is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228326,"text":"That's the simplest check that you could make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228328,"text":"So as <EXPRESSION> goes to infinity, less and less steep.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228329,"text":"So that's also consistent here, when <EXPRESSION> is very large, this is a smaller and smaller number in magnitude, although it's always negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228330,"text":"It's always sloping down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228331,"text":"All right, so I've managed to fill the boards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228332,"text":"So maybe I should stop for a question or <EXPRESSION>.Student:So the question is to explain again this limiting process.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228333,"text":"So the formula here is we have basically <EXPRESSION> numbers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228334,"text":"So in other words, why is it that this expression, when <EXPRESSION> tends to <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> ?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228335,"text":"Let me illustrate it by sticking in a number for <EXPRESSION> to make it more explicit.","entities":[{"id":91458,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228336,"text":"All right, so for instance, let me stick in here for <EXPRESSION> the number <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228337,"text":"Then it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228338,"text":"That's the situation that we've got.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228339,"text":"And now the question is what happens as this number gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and gets to be practically <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228340,"text":"Well, literally what we can do is just plug in <EXPRESSION> there, and you get <EXPRESSION> in the denominator.","entities":[{"id":91460,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":99,"end_offset":110}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228341,"text":"<EXPRESSION> in the numerator.","entities":[{"id":91461,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":20,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228342,"text":"So this tends to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228343,"text":"And that's what I'm saying in general with this extra number here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228344,"text":"Other questions?So the question is what happened between this step and this step, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228345,"text":"Explain this step here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228346,"text":"Alright, so there were two parts to that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228347,"text":"The first is this <EXPRESSION> which is sitting in the denominator, I factored all the way out front.","entities":[{"id":91462,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":55,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228348,"text":"And so what's in the parentheses is supposed to be the same as what's in the numerator of this other expression.","entities":[{"id":91463,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":77,"end_offset":86}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228351,"text":"And then I just figured out what the numerator had to be without really.","entities":[{"id":91467,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":37,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228353,"text":"But there's a perception that it's harder.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228354,"text":"And so I really have a duty to give you the calculus made harder story here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228355,"text":"So we have to make things harder, because that's our job.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228356,"text":"And this is actually what most people do in calculus, and it's the reason why calculus has a bad reputation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228357,"text":"So the secret is that when people ask problems in calculus, they generally ask them in context.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228358,"text":"And there are many, many other things going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228359,"text":"And so the little piece of the problem which is calculus is actually fairly routine and has to be isolated and gotten through.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228360,"text":"But all the rest of it, relies on everything else you learned in mathematics up to this stage, from grade school through high school.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228361,"text":"So that's the complication.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228362,"text":"So now we're going to do a little bit of calculus made hard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228363,"text":"By talking about a word problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228364,"text":"We only have one sort of word problem that we can pose, because all we've talked about is this geometry point of view.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228365,"text":"So far those are the only kinds of word problems we can pose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228366,"text":"So what we're gonna do is just pose such a problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228367,"text":"So find the areas of triangles, enclosed by the axes and the tangent to <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228368,"text":"OK, so that's a geometry problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228369,"text":"And let me draw a picture of it.","entities":[{"id":91468,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228370,"text":"It's practically the same as the picture for example one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228371,"text":"We only consider the first quadrant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228372,"text":"Here's our shape.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228373,"text":"All right, it's the hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228374,"text":"And here's maybe one of our tangent lines, which is coming in like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228375,"text":"And then we're trying to find this area here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228376,"text":"Right, so there's our problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228377,"text":"So why does it have to do with calculus?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228378,"text":"It has to do with calculus because there's a tangent line in it, so we're gonna need to do some calculus to answer this question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228379,"text":"But as you'll see, the calculus is the easy part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228380,"text":"So let's get started with this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228381,"text":"First of all, I'm gonna label a few things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228382,"text":"And one important thing to remember of course, is that the curve is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228383,"text":"That's perfectly reasonable to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228384,"text":"And also, we're gonna calculate the areas of the triangles, and you could ask yourself, in terms of what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228385,"text":"Well, we're gonna have to pick a point and give it a name.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228386,"text":"And since we need a number, we're gonna have to do more than geometry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228387,"text":"We're gonna have to do some of this analysis just as we've done before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228388,"text":"So I'm gonna pick a point and, consistent with the labeling we've done before, I'm gonna to call it (<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>).","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228389,"text":"So that's almost half the battle, having notations, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> for the variables, and <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, for the specific point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228390,"text":"Now, once you see that you have these labelings, I hope it's reasonable to do the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228391,"text":"So first of all, this is the point <EXPRESSION>, and over here is the point <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228392,"text":"That's something that we're used to in graphs.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228393,"text":"And in order to figure out the area of this triangle, it's pretty clear that we should find the base, which is that we should find this location here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228394,"text":"And we should find the height, so we need to find that value there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228395,"text":"Let's go ahead and do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228396,"text":"So how are we going to do this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228397,"text":"Well, so let's just take a look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228398,"text":"So what is it that we need to do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228399,"text":"I claim that there's only one calculus step, and I'm gonna put a star here for this tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228400,"text":"I have to understand what the tangent line is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228401,"text":"Once I've figured out what the tangent line is, the rest of the problem is no longer calculus.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228402,"text":"It's just that slope that we need.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228403,"text":"So what's the formula for the tangent line?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228404,"text":"Put that over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228405,"text":"it's going to be <EXPRESSION> =, and here's the magic number, we already calculated it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228406,"text":"It's in the box over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228407,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228408,"text":"So this is the only bit of calculus in this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228409,"text":"But now we're not done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228410,"text":"We have to finish it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228411,"text":"We have to figure out all the rest of these quantities so we can figure out the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228412,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228413,"text":"So how do we do that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228414,"text":"Well, to find this point, this has a name.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228415,"text":"We're gonna find the so called <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228416,"text":"That's the first thing we're going to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228417,"text":"So to do that, what we need to do is to find where this horizontal line meets that diagonal line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228418,"text":"And the equation for the <EXPRESSION> is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228419,"text":"So we plug in <EQUATION>, that's this horizontal line, and we find this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228420,"text":"So let's do that into star.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228421,"text":"We get <EXPRESSION> minus, oh one other thing we need to know.","entities":[{"id":91473,"label":"command","start_offset":20,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228422,"text":"We know that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , and <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> , so this thing is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228423,"text":"And that's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228424,"text":"And here's <EXPRESSION>, and here's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228425,"text":"All right, so in order to find this x value, I have to plug in one equation into the other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228426,"text":"So this simplifies a bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228427,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228428,"text":"And this is plus <EXPRESSION> because the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> cancel somewhat.","entities":[{"id":91474,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16},{"id":91475,"label":"command","start_offset":72,"end_offset":78}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228429,"text":"And so if I put this on the other side, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228430,"text":"And if I then multiply through - so that's what this implies - and if I multiply through by <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":91477,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":22},{"id":91478,"label":"command","start_offset":72,"end_offset":80}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228431,"text":"OK, so I claim that this point we've just calculated, it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228432,"text":"Now, I'm almost done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228433,"text":"I need to get the other one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228434,"text":"I need to get this one up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228435,"text":"Now I'm gonna use a very big shortcut to do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228436,"text":"So the shortcut to the y-intercept is to use symmetry.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228437,"text":"All right, I claim I can stare at this and I can look at that, and I know the formula for the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228438,"text":"It's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228439,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228440,"text":"That's what that one is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228441,"text":"So this one is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228442,"text":"And the reason I know this is the following: so here's the symmetry of the situation, which is not completely direct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228443,"text":"It's a kind of mirror symmetry around the diagonal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228446,"text":"So if everywhere I see a <EXPRESSION> I make it an <EXPRESSION>, and everywhere I see an <EXPRESSION> I make it a <EXPRESSION>, the switch will take place.","entities":[{"id":91484,"label":"command","start_offset":132,"end_offset":138}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228447,"text":"So why is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228448,"text":"That's just an accident of this equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228449,"text":"That's because, so the symmetry explained.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228450,"text":"is that the equation is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228451,"text":"But that's the same thing as <EQUATION>, if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, which is the same thing as <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":91486,"label":"command","start_offset":46,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228452,"text":"So here's where the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> get reversed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228454,"text":"And you can do the same thing analogously the other way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228455,"text":"All right so I'm almost done with the geometry problem, and let's finish it off now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228456,"text":"Well, let me hold off for one second before I finish it off.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228457,"text":"What I'd like to say is just make one more tiny remark.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228458,"text":"And this is the hardest part of calculus in my opinion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228459,"text":"So the hardest part of calculus is that we call it one variable calculus, but we're perfectly happy to deal with <EXPRESSION> variables at a time or <EXPRESSION>, or any number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228460,"text":"In this problem, I had an <EXPRESSION>, a <EXPRESSION>, an <EXPRESSION> and a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228461,"text":"That's already <EXPRESSION> different things that have various relationships between them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228462,"text":"Of course the manipulations we do with them are algebraic, and when we're doing the derivatives we just consider what's known as one variable calculus.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228463,"text":"But really there are millions of variable floating around potentially.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228464,"text":"So that's what makes things complicated, and that's something that you have to get used to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228466,"text":"There's something deliberately sloppy about the way we deal with these variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228467,"text":"The reason is very simple.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228468,"text":"There are already <EXPRESSION> variables here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228469,"text":"I don't wanna create six names for variables or eight names for variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228470,"text":"But really in this problem there were about eight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228471,"text":"I just slipped them by you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228472,"text":"So why is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228473,"text":"Well notice that the first time that I got a formula for <EXPRESSION> here, it was this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228475,"text":"I used this equation here, so this is not <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228476,"text":"That's the wrong thing to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228477,"text":"It's an easy mistake to make if the formulas are all a blur to you and you're not paying attention to where they are on the diagram.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228478,"text":"You see that x-intercept calculation there involved where this horizontal line met this diagonal line, and <EQUATION> represented this line here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228479,"text":"So the sloppiness is that <EXPRESSION> means two different things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228480,"text":"And we do this constantly because it's way, way more complicated not to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228481,"text":"It's much more convenient for us to allow ourselves the flexibility to change the role that this letter plays in the middle of a computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228482,"text":"And similarly, later on, if I had done this by this more straightforward method, for the y-intercept, I would have set <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":91494,"label":"command","start_offset":115,"end_offset":118}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228483,"text":"That would have been this vertical line, which is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228484,"text":"But I didn't change the letter <EXPRESSION> when I did that, because that would be a waste for us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228485,"text":"So this is one of the main confusions that happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228486,"text":"If you can keep yourself straight, you're a lot better off, and as I say this is one of the complexities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228487,"text":"All right, so now let's finish off the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228488,"text":"Let me finally get this area here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228489,"text":"So, actually I'll just finish it off right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228490,"text":"So the area of the triangle is, well it's the base times the height.","entities":[{"id":91498,"label":"command","start_offset":51,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228491,"text":"The base is <EXPRESSION>, the height is <EXPRESSION>, and a half of that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228492,"text":"So it's <EXPRESSION> , which is <EXPRESSION>, which is, lo and behold, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228493,"text":"So the amusing thing in this case is that it actually didn't matter what <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228494,"text":"We get the same answer every time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228495,"text":"That's just an accident of the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228496,"text":"It happens to be the function with that property.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228497,"text":"All right, so we have some more business today, some serious business.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228498,"text":"So let me continue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228499,"text":"So, first of all, I want to give you a few more notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228501,"text":"And the first one is the following: we already wrote <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228502,"text":"And so when we write <EXPRESSION>, that means the same thing as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91501,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228503,"text":"That's a typical notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228504,"text":"And previously we wrote <EXPRESSION> for the derivative, so this is Newton's notation for the derivative.","entities":[{"id":91502,"label":"method","start_offset":45,"end_offset":55},{"id":91503,"label":"method","start_offset":94,"end_offset":104}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228505,"text":"But there are other notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228506,"text":"And one of them is <EXPRESSION>, and another one is <EXPRESSION>, meaning exactly the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228507,"text":"And sometimes we let the function slip down below so that becomes <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228508,"text":"So these are all notations that are used for the derivative, and these were initiated by Leibniz.","entities":[{"id":91504,"label":"method","start_offset":49,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228509,"text":"And these notations are used interchangeably, sometimes practically together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228510,"text":"They both turn out to be extremely useful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228511,"text":"This one omits - notice that this thing omits - the underlying base point, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228512,"text":"That's one of the nuisances.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228513,"text":"It doesn't give you all the information.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228514,"text":"But there are lots of situations like that where people leave out some of the important information, and you have to fill it in from context.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228515,"text":"So that's another couple of notations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228516,"text":"So now I have one more calculation for you today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228517,"text":"I carried out this calculation of the derivative of the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91505,"label":"method","start_offset":38,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228518,"text":"I wanna take care of some other powers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228519,"text":"So let's do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228520,"text":"So Example <EXPRESSION> is going to be the function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228521,"text":"<EQUATION>; one of these guys.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228522,"text":"And now what we're trying to figure out is the derivative with respect to <EQUATION> in our new notation, what this =.","entities":[{"id":91507,"label":"method","start_offset":47,"end_offset":57}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228523,"text":"So again, we're going to form this expression, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228524,"text":"And we're going to make some algebraic simplification.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228525,"text":"So what we plug in for <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228526,"text":"Now before, let me just stick this in then I'm gonna erase it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228527,"text":"Before, I wrote <EXPRESSION> here and <EXPRESSION> there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228528,"text":"But now I'm going to get rid of it, because in this particular calculation, it's a nuisance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228529,"text":"I don't have an <EXPRESSION> floating around, which means something different from the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228530,"text":"And I just don't wanna have to keep on writing all those symbols.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228531,"text":"It's a waste of blackboard energy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228532,"text":"There's a total amount of energy, and I've already filled up so many blackboards that, there's just a limited amount.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228533,"text":"Plus, I'm trying to conserve chalk.","entities":[{"id":91509,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":4}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228534,"text":"Anyway, no <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228535,"text":"So think of <EXPRESSION> as fixed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228536,"text":"In this case, <EXPRESSION> moves and <EXPRESSION> is fixed in this calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228537,"text":"All right now, in order to simplify this, in order to understand algebraically what's going on, I need to understand what the nth power of a sum is.","entities":[{"id":91510,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":35},{"id":91511,"label":"method","start_offset":141,"end_offset":144}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228538,"text":"And that's a famous formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228539,"text":"We only need a little tiny bit of it, called the binomial theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228540,"text":"So, the binomial theorem which is in your text and explained in an appendix, says that if you take the sum of two guys and you take them to the nth power, that of course is <EXPRESSION> multiplied by itself <EXPRESSION> times.","entities":[{"id":91512,"label":"command","start_offset":94,"end_offset":98},{"id":91513,"label":"method","start_offset":103,"end_offset":106}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228541,"text":"And so the first term is <EXPRESSION>, that's when all of the <EXPRESSION> factors come in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228542,"text":"And then, you could have this factor of <EXPRESSION> and all the rest <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228543,"text":"So at least <EXPRESSION> term of the form <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228544,"text":"And how many times does that happen?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228545,"text":"Well, it happens when there's a factor from here, from the next factor, and so on, and so on, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228547,"text":"And now the great thing is that, with this alone, all the rest of the terms are junk that we won't have to worry about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228548,"text":"So to be more specific, there's a very careful notation for the junk.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228549,"text":"The junk is what's called <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228550,"text":"What that means is that these are terms of order, so with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> or higher.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228551,"text":"All right, that's how.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228552,"text":"Very exciting, higher order terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228553,"text":"OK, so this is the only algebra that we need to do, and now we just need to combine it together to get our result.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228554,"text":"So, now I'm going to just carry out the cancellations that we need.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228555,"text":"So here we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228556,"text":"We have <EXPRESSION>, which remember was <EXPRESSION> times this, which is this times, now this is <EXPRESSION> this junk term, minus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91519,"label":"command","start_offset":54,"end_offset":59},{"id":91520,"label":"command","start_offset":80,"end_offset":85},{"id":91521,"label":"command","start_offset":128,"end_offset":133}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228557,"text":"So that's what we have so far based on our previous calculations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228558,"text":"Now, I'm going to do the main cancellation, which is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228559,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228560,"text":"So, that's <EXPRESSION> plus this term here.","entities":[{"id":91522,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228561,"text":"And now I can divide in by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91523,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228562,"text":"So I get <EXPRESSION> plus, now it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":91525,"label":"command","start_offset":22,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228563,"text":"There's at least one factor of <EXPRESSION> not two factors of <EXPRESSION>, because I have to cancel one of them.","entities":[{"id":91526,"label":"command","start_offset":95,"end_offset":101}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228565,"text":"In the limit this term is gonna be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228566,"text":"That's why I called it junk originally, because it disappears.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228567,"text":"And in math, junk is something that goes away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228568,"text":"So this tends to, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228569,"text":"And so what I've shown you is that <EXPRESSION> to the <EXPRESSION>-- sorry, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228570,"text":"So now this is gonna be super important to you right on your problem set in every possible way, and I want to tell you one thing, one way in which it's very important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228571,"text":"One way that extends it immediately.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228572,"text":"So this thing extends to polynomials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228573,"text":"We get quite a lot out of this one calculation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228575,"text":"And then here, I'll get <EXPRESSION> so <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228576,"text":"So this is the type of thing that we get out of it, and we're gonna make more hay with that next time.Yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":228578,"text":"No, the binomial theorem is a general formula which also specifies exactly what the junk is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230188,"text":"Okay, you can also see why I violated the natural order of things and put the e to the ax on the left in order that it pass over more easily.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230189,"text":"So, the answer on the left-hand side is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92068,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":22,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230190,"text":"Now, what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230191,"text":"Write it in this form.","entities":[{"id":92069,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230192,"text":"It's going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230193,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> is, change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230194,"text":"So, the first factor is going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230195,"text":"And, what's the second factor?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230196,"text":"Change <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230197,"text":"It turns into <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230198,"text":"All this is the result of taking that <EXPRESSION>, and changing <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230199,"text":"And now, this is to be applied to what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230200,"text":"Well, <EXPRESSION> is already passed over.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230201,"text":"So, what's left is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230202,"text":"And, that's to be divided by the constant, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230203,"text":"Now, what does this all come out to be?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230204,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, what's <EXPRESSION> applied to <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230205,"text":"One, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230206,"text":"And now, what's this thing applied to the constant one?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230207,"text":"Well, the <EXPRESSION> kills it, so it has no effect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230208,"text":"It makes it <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230209,"text":"The rest just multiplies it by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230210,"text":"So, the answer to the top is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230211,"text":"And, the answer to the bottom is <EXPRESSION>, which I showed you by just explicit calculation is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230212,"text":"And so the answer is, <EXPRESSION> comes out right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230213,"text":"Now, the other one, the other formula comes out the same way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230214,"text":"I'll leave that as an exercise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230215,"text":"Also, I don't dare do it because it's much too close to the problem I asked you to do for homework.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230216,"text":"So, let's by way of conclusion, I'll do one more simple example, okay?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230217,"text":"And then, you can feel you understand something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230218,"text":"I'm sort of bothered that I haven't done any examples of this more complicated case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230219,"text":"So, I'll pick an easy version instead of the one that you have in your notes, which is the one you have for homework, which is even easier.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230220,"text":"So, this one's epsilon less easy.Okay, notice that one is a simple root.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230221,"text":"The one I'm talking about is the a here, which is one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230222,"text":"One is a simple root of the polynomial <EXPRESSION>, isn't it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230223,"text":"It's a <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230224,"text":"Put <EQUATION> and you get <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230225,"text":"It's a simple root because anybody can see that one is not a double root because you know from critical damping, if one were a double root, you know just what the polynomial would look like, and it wouldn't look like that at all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230226,"text":"It would not look like <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230227,"text":"It would look differently.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230228,"text":"Therefore, that proves that <EXPRESSION> is a simple root.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230229,"text":"Okay, what's the particular solution, therefore?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230230,"text":"The particular solution is <EXPRESSION> divided by the derivative, the derivative evaluated at the point, so, what's <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[{"id":92073,"label":"method","start_offset":55,"end_offset":65},{"id":92074,"label":"method","start_offset":71,"end_offset":81}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230231,"text":"It is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230232,"text":"If I evaluate it at the point, <EXPRESSION>, it is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230233,"text":"So, if this is to be divided by <EXPRESSION>, in other words, it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230234,"text":"And, if you don't believe it, you could plug it in and check it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230235,"text":"Okay, I'm letting you out one minute early.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230236,"text":"Remember that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230237,"text":"I'm trying to pay off the accumulated debt.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230239,"text":"We're talking today about exponentials and logarithms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230240,"text":"And these are the last functions that I need to introduce, the last standard functions that we need to connect with calculus, that you've learned about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230241,"text":"And they're certainly as fundamental, if not more so, than trigonometric functions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230242,"text":"So first of all, we'll start out with a number, <EXPRESSION>, which is positive, which is usually called a base.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230243,"text":"And then we have these properties that <EXPRESSION> is always <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230244,"text":"That's how we get started.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230245,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230246,"text":"And of course <EXPRESSION>, not surprisingly, is <EXPRESSION>, etc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230247,"text":"And the general rule is that <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230248,"text":"So this is the basic rule of exponents, and with these two initial properties, that defines the exponential function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230250,"text":"Then that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230251,"text":"So that's an additional property that we'll take for granted, which you learned in high school.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230252,"text":"Now, in order to understand what all the values of <EXPRESSION> are, we need to first remember that if you're taking a rational power that it's the ratio of <EXPRESSION> integers power of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230254,"text":"So that's the definition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230255,"text":"And then, when you're defining <EXPRESSION>, so <EXPRESSION> is defined for all <EXPRESSION> by filling in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230257,"text":"This is really what your calculator does when it gives you <EXPRESSION>, because you can't even punch in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230258,"text":"It doesn't really exist on your calculator.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230259,"text":"There's some decimal expansion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230260,"text":"So it takes the decimal expansion to a certain length and spits out a number which is pretty close to the correct answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230261,"text":"But indeed, in theory, there is an <EXPRESSION>, even though the <EXPRESSION> is irrational.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230262,"text":"And there's <EXPRESSION> and so forth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230263,"text":"All right, so that's the exponential function, and let's draw a picture of one.","entities":[{"id":92080,"label":"command","start_offset":57,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230264,"text":"So we'll try, say <EQUATION> here.","entities":[{"id":92081,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230265,"text":"And I'm not going to draw such a careful graph, but let's just plot the most important point, which is the point (0, 1).","entities":[{"id":92082,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":25},{"id":92083,"label":"command","start_offset":41,"end_offset":46},{"id":92084,"label":"command","start_offset":63,"end_offset":67}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230266,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230267,"text":"And then maybe we'll go back up here to <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230268,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> is this point here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230270,"text":"And over here, we have <EXPRESSION>, and so that goes all the way up to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230271,"text":"And then exponentials are remarkably fast.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230272,"text":"So it's off the board what happens next out at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230274,"text":"All right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230275,"text":"Now I've just visually, at least, graphically filled in all the rest of the points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230276,"text":"You have to imagine all these rational numbers, and so forth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230278,"text":"And so forth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230279,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230280,"text":"So that's not too far along.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230281,"text":"So now what's our goal?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230282,"text":"Well, obviously we want to do calculus here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230283,"text":"So our goal, here, for now - and it's gonna take a while.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230284,"text":"We have to think about it pretty hard.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230285,"text":"We have to calculate what this derivative is.","entities":[{"id":92087,"label":"method","start_offset":31,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230286,"text":"All right, so we'll get started.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230287,"text":"And the way we get started is simply by plugging in the definition of the derivative.","entities":[{"id":92090,"label":"method","start_offset":74,"end_offset":84}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230288,"text":"The derivative is the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92091,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230289,"text":"So that's what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230292,"text":"So we have here, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230293,"text":"So what I want to use is just the property that <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92094,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230294,"text":"And if I do that, I see that I can factor out a common factor in the numerator, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92095,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":45},{"id":92096,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":69,"end_offset":78}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230295,"text":"So we'll write this as the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> times this ratio, now <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92097,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14},{"id":92098,"label":"command","start_offset":70,"end_offset":75}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230296,"text":"So far, so good?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230297,"text":"We're actually almost to some serious progress here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230298,"text":"So there's one other important conceptual step which we need to understand.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230299,"text":"And this is a relatively simple one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230300,"text":"We actually did this before, by the way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230301,"text":"We did this with sines and cosines.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230302,"text":"The next thing I want to point out to you is that you're used to thinking of <EXPRESSION> as being the variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230303,"text":"And indeed, already we were discussing <EXPRESSION> as being the variable and <EXPRESSION> as being fixed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230304,"text":"But for the purposes of this limit, there's a different variable that's moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230305,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is fixed and <EXPRESSION> is the thing that's moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230306,"text":"So that means that this factor here, which is a common factor, is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230307,"text":"And we can just factor it out of the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230308,"text":"It doesn't affect the limit at all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230310,"text":"So I'm just going to factor that out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230311,"text":"So that's my next step here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230312,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, and then I have the limit <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230313,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230314,"text":"And so what I have here, so this is by definition the derivative.","entities":[{"id":92102,"label":"method","start_offset":54,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230315,"text":"So here is <EXPRESSION>, and it's = this expression here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230316,"text":"Now, I want to stare at this expression, and see what it's telling us, because it's telling us as much as we can get so far, without some-- So first let's just look at what this says.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230317,"text":"So what it's saying is that the derivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> times something that we don't yet know.","entities":[{"id":92104,"label":"method","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42},{"id":92105,"label":"command","start_offset":75,"end_offset":80}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230318,"text":"And I'm going to call this something, this mystery number, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230319,"text":"So I'm gonna make the label, <EXPRESSION> = the limit as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION> of a to the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230320,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230321,"text":"So this is a definition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230322,"text":"So this mystery number <EXPRESSION> has a geometric interpretation, as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230323,"text":"So let me describe that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230324,"text":"It has a geometric interpretation, and it's a very, very significant number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230325,"text":"So let's work out what that is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230326,"text":"So first of all, let's rewrite the expression in the box, using the shorthand for this number.","entities":[{"id":92106,"label":"command","start_offset":23,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230327,"text":"So if I just rewrite it, it says <EXPRESSION> = this factor, which is <EXPRESSION>, times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92107,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":20},{"id":92108,"label":"command","start_offset":84,"end_offset":89}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230329,"text":"So we've almost solved the problem of finding the derivative of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92111,"label":"method","start_offset":50,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230330,"text":"We just have to figure out this one number, <EXPRESSION>, and we get the rest.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230331,"text":"So let me point out two more things about this number, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230332,"text":"So first of all, if I plug in <EQUATION>, that's going to be <EXPRESSION> , at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230333,"text":"According to this formula, that's <EXPRESSION>, which of course <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230334,"text":"So what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230335,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is the derivative of this function at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230338,"text":"So again over here, if you looked at the picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230339,"text":"I'll draw the one tangent line in here, which is this one here.","entities":[{"id":92113,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230340,"text":"And this thing has slope, what we're calling <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230341,"text":"So, if I graph the function <EQUATION>, I'll get a certain slope here.","entities":[{"id":92114,"label":"command","start_offset":9,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230342,"text":"If I graph it with a different base, I might get another slope.","entities":[{"id":92116,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":10}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230343,"text":"And what we got so far is the following phenomenon: if we know this one number, if we know the slope at this one place, we will be able to figure out the formula for the slope everywhere else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230344,"text":"Now, that's actually exactly the same thing that we did for sines and cosines.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230345,"text":"We knew the slope of the <EXPRESSION> and the <EXPRESSION> function at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230346,"text":"The sine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230347,"text":"The cosine function had slope <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230351,"text":"So we're following the same procedure that we did before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230352,"text":"But at this point we're stuck.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230353,"text":"We're stuck, because that time using radians, this very clever idea of radians in geometry, we were able to actually figure out what the slope is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230354,"text":"Whereas here, we're not so sure, what <EXPRESSION> is, for instance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230355,"text":"We just don't know yet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230356,"text":"So, the basic question that we have to deal with right now is what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230357,"text":"That's what we're left with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230358,"text":"And, the curious fact is that the clever thing to do is to beg the question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230359,"text":"So we're going to go through a very circular route here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230360,"text":"That is circuitous, not circular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230361,"text":"Circular is a bad word in math.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230362,"text":"That means that one thing depends on another, and that depends on it, and maybe both are wrong.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230363,"text":"Circuitous means, we're going to be taking a roundabout route.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230364,"text":"And we're going to discover that even though we refuse to answer this question right now, we'll succeed in answering it eventually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230365,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230366,"text":"So how are we going to beg the question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230368,"text":"That's the trick that we're going to use.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230369,"text":"We don't yet know what <EXPRESSION> is, but we're just going to suppose that we have it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230370,"text":"Now, I'm going to show you a bunch of consequences of this, and also I have to persuade you that it actually does exist.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230371,"text":"So first, let me explain what the first consequence is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230372,"text":"First of all, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then if you look at this formula over here and you write it down for e, you have something which is a very usable formula.","entities":[{"id":92128,"label":"command","start_offset":98,"end_offset":103}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230373,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230374,"text":"All right, so that's an incredibly important formula which is the fundamental one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230375,"text":"It's the only one you have to remember from what we've done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230376,"text":"So maybe I should have highlighted it in several colors here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230377,"text":"That's a big deal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230378,"text":"Very happy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230380,"text":"That's the way we defined it, alright?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230381,"text":"So if you plug in <EQUATION> here on the right hand side, you got <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92129,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":41,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230382,"text":"Slope <EXPRESSION> at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230383,"text":"So that's great.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230384,"text":"Except of course, since we don't know what <EXPRESSION> is, this is a little bit dicey.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230385,"text":"So, next even before explaining what <EXPRESSION> is.In fact, we won't get to what <EXPRESSION> really is until the very end of this lecture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230386,"text":"But I have to persuade you why <EXPRESSION> exists.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230387,"text":"We have to have some explanation for why we know there is such a number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230388,"text":"Okay, so first of all, let me start with the one that we supposedly know, which is the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230389,"text":"We'll call it <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230390,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230391,"text":"So that's the first thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230392,"text":"And remember, that the property that it had, was that <EXPRESSION> was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230394,"text":"Of the tangent line, that is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230395,"text":"So now, what we're going to consider is any kind of stretching.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230396,"text":"We're going to stretch this function by a factor <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230397,"text":"Any number <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230398,"text":"So what we're going to consider is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230400,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.So whatever it is, if I have a different base which is expressed in terms of <EXPRESSION>, of the form <EXPRESSION>, then that new function is described by this function <EXPRESSION>, the stretch.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230401,"text":"So what happens when you stretch a function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230402,"text":"That's the same thing as shrinking the x axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230403,"text":"So when <EXPRESSION> gets larger, this corresponding point over here would be over here, and so this corresponding point would be over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230404,"text":"So you shrink this picture, and the slope here tilts up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230405,"text":"So, as we increase <EXPRESSION>, the slope gets steeper and steeper.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230406,"text":"Let's see that explicitly, numerically, here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230407,"text":"Explicitly, numerically, if I take the derivative here.So the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, that's the chain rule, right?","entities":[{"id":92135,"label":"command","start_offset":30,"end_offset":34},{"id":92136,"label":"method","start_offset":39,"end_offset":49},{"id":92137,"label":"method","start_offset":62,"end_offset":72},{"id":92138,"label":"method","start_offset":114,"end_offset":124}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230409,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230410,"text":"And so if we do it at <EXPRESSION>, we're just getting <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION> times this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92140,"label":"command","start_offset":91,"end_offset":96}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230411,"text":"So how is it exactly that we cook up the right base <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230412,"text":"So <EQUATION> when <EQUATION> over this number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230413,"text":"In other words, we can pick all possible slopes that we want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230414,"text":"This just has the effect of multiplying the slope by a factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230415,"text":"And we can shift the slope at <EXPRESSION> however we want, and we're going to do it so that the slope exactly matches <EXPRESSION>, the one that we want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230416,"text":"We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230417,"text":"We still don't know what <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230418,"text":"But at least we know that it's there somewhere.Student: How do you know it's <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230419,"text":"How do I know?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230420,"text":"Well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230421,"text":"If <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then the formula for <EXPRESSION> is this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230422,"text":"I've decided what <EXPRESSION> is, so therefore there's a formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230423,"text":"And furthermore, by the chain rule, there's a formula for the derivative.","entities":[{"id":92142,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34},{"id":92143,"label":"method","start_offset":62,"end_offset":72}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230424,"text":"And it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230425,"text":"So again, scaling does this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230426,"text":"By the way, we did exactly the same thing with the <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230427,"text":"If you think of the sine function here, let me just remind you here, what happens with the chain rule, you get <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[{"id":92144,"label":"method","start_offset":91,"end_offset":101}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230428,"text":"So the fact that we set things up beautifully with radians that this thing is, but we could change the scale to anything, such as degrees, by the appropriate factor <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230429,"text":"And then there would be this scale factor shift of the derivative formulas.","entities":[{"id":92147,"label":"method","start_offset":55,"end_offset":65}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230430,"text":"Of course, the one with radians is the easy one, because the factor is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230431,"text":"The one with degrees is horrible, because the factor is some crazy number like <EXPRESSION>, or something like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230432,"text":"Okay, so there's something going on here which is exactly the same as that kind of re-scaling.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230433,"text":"So, so far we've got only one formula which is a keeper here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230434,"text":"This one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230435,"text":"We have a preliminary formula that we still haven't completely explained which has a little wavy line there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230436,"text":"And we have to fit all these things together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230437,"text":"Okay, so now to fit them together, I need to introduce the natural log.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230438,"text":"So the natural log is denoted this way, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230439,"text":"So maybe I'll call it a new letter name, we'll call it <EQUATION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230440,"text":"But if we were reversing things, if we started out with a function <EQUATION> , the property that it would have is that it's the inverse function of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230441,"text":"So it has the property that the <EQUATION>.So this defines the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230442,"text":"Now the logarithm has a bunch of properties and they come from the exponential properties in principle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230443,"text":"You remember these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230444,"text":"And I'm just going to remind you of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230445,"text":"So the main one that I just want to remind you of is that the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230446,"text":"And maybe a few more are worth reminding you of.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230447,"text":"One is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230448,"text":"A second is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230449,"text":"All right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230450,"text":"So these correspond to the inverse relationships here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230451,"text":"If I plug in here, <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230452,"text":"If I plug in <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>, I get the corresponding numbers here: <EQUATION> and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230453,"text":"And maybe it would be worth it to plot the picture once to reinforce this.","entities":[{"id":92149,"label":"command","start_offset":34,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230454,"text":"So here I'll put them on the same chart.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230455,"text":"If you have here <EXPRESSION> over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230456,"text":"It looks like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230457,"text":"Then the logarithm which I'll maybe put in a different color.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230458,"text":"So this crosses at this all-important point here, (0, 1).","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230460,"text":"So that's this shape here, going down like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230463,"text":"But the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230465,"text":"And notice it's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive, which corresponds to the fact that <EXPRESSION> is always positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230466,"text":"So in other words, this white curve is only above this axis, and the orange one is to the right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230467,"text":"It's only defined for <EXPRESSION> positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230468,"text":"Oh, one other thing I should mention is the slope here is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230469,"text":"And so the slope there is also going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230470,"text":"Now, what we're allowed to do relatively easily, because we have the tools to do it, is to compute the derivative of the logarithm.","entities":[{"id":92153,"label":"method","start_offset":103,"end_offset":113}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230471,"text":"So to find the derivative of <EXPRESSION>, we're going to use implicit differentiation.","entities":[{"id":92154,"label":"method","start_offset":15,"end_offset":25},{"id":92155,"label":"command","start_offset":58,"end_offset":61},{"id":92156,"label":"method","start_offset":71,"end_offset":86}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230474,"text":"And the mechanism is the following: you write down here <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92160,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230477,"text":"But now we don't know how to differentiate this equation, but if we exponentiate it, so that's the same thing as <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92162,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230478,"text":"Because let's just stick this in here.Now we can differentiate this.","entities":[{"id":92163,"label":"command","start_offset":49,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230479,"text":"So let's do the differentiation here.","entities":[{"id":92164,"label":"method","start_offset":16,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230480,"text":"We have <EQUATION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230481,"text":"And then this, by the chain rule, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92165,"label":"method","start_offset":22,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230482,"text":"The product of these two factors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230483,"text":"That's = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230485,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230486,"text":"And so finally, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230487,"text":"But what is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230488,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230489,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230490,"text":"So what we discovered is, and now I get to put another green guy around here, is that this = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230491,"text":"So alright, now we have two companion formulas here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230492,"text":"The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230493,"text":"And the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> is itself, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230494,"text":"And it's time to return to the problem that we were having a little bit of trouble with, which is somewhat not explicit, which is this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230495,"text":"We want to now differentiate <EXPRESSION> in general, not just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92168,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":28}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230496,"text":"So let's work that out, and I want to explain it in a couple of ways, so you're going to have to remember this, because I'm going to erase it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230497,"text":"But what I'd like you to do is, so now I want to teach you how to differentiate basically any exponential.","entities":[{"id":92169,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230498,"text":"So now to differentiate any exponential.","entities":[{"id":92170,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230499,"text":"There are two methods.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230502,"text":"You'll see both of them, and they're equally valuable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230503,"text":"So we're going to just describe them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230504,"text":"Method one I'm going to illustrate on the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92171,"label":"command","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230505,"text":"So we're interested in differentiating this thing, exactly this problem that I still didn't solve yet.So here it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230506,"text":"And here's the procedure.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230508,"text":"So how do you convert to base <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230509,"text":"Well, you write <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> to some power.","entities":[{"id":92174,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230510,"text":"So what power is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230511,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION> to the power <EXPRESSION>, to the power <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230512,"text":"And that is just <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230513,"text":"So we've made our conversion now to base <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230514,"text":"The exponential of something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230515,"text":"So now I'm going to carry out the differentiation.","entities":[{"id":92175,"label":"method","start_offset":34,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230516,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230517,"text":"And now, this is a step which causes great confusion when you first see it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230518,"text":"And you must get used to it, because it's easy, not hard.The rate of change of this with respect to <EXPRESSION> is, let me do it by analogy here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230519,"text":"Because say I had <EXPRESSION> and I were differentiating it.","entities":[{"id":92177,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":11}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230520,"text":"The chain rule would say that this is just <EXPRESSION>, the rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92178,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14},{"id":92179,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230521,"text":"The rate of change of <EXPRESSION> with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230522,"text":"So this is the ordinary chain rule.","entities":[{"id":92180,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230523,"text":"And what we're doing up here is exactly the same thing, because <EXPRESSION>, as frightening as it looks, with all three letters there, is just a fixed number.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230524,"text":"It's not moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230525,"text":"It's a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230526,"text":"So the constant just accelerates the rate of change by that factor, which is what the chain rule is doing.","entities":[{"id":92181,"label":"method","start_offset":86,"end_offset":96}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230527,"text":"So this = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230528,"text":"Same business here with ln a replacing <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230529,"text":"So this is something you've got to get used to in time for the exam, for instance, because you're going to be doing a million of these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230530,"text":"So do get used to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230531,"text":"So here's the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230532,"text":"On the other hand, this expression here was the same as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230533,"text":"So another way of writing this, and I'll put this into a box, but actually I never remember this particularly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230534,"text":"I just re-derive it every time, is that the derivative of <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92184,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":16},{"id":92185,"label":"method","start_offset":44,"end_offset":54}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230535,"text":"Now I'm going to get rid of what's underneath it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230536,"text":"So this is another formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230537,"text":"So there's the formula I've essentially finished here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230538,"text":"And notice, what is the magic number?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230539,"text":"The magic number is the natural log of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230544,"text":"Let me emphasize to you again, something about what's going on here, which has to do with scale change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230546,"text":"The derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, these are the two most obvious bases that you might want to use, is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92188,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230548,"text":"They come up naturally.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230552,"text":"So I told you about this first method, now I want to tell you about a second method here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230554,"text":"So how does this work?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230555,"text":"Well, sometimes you're having trouble differentiating a function, and it's easier to differentiate its logarithm.","entities":[{"id":92193,"label":"command","start_offset":85,"end_offset":98}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":230735,"text":"I'll let you check.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230736,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230737,"text":"And what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230738,"text":"Well, if you multiply this out, I'll let you check that you get <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92261,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230739,"text":"So this is just some computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230740,"text":"And so what we're solving here is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230741,"text":"And we remember how to do this just by using elimination.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230742,"text":"We replace the second row by <EXPRESSION> times the second row minus <EXPRESSION> times the first row.","entities":[{"id":92263,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":47},{"id":92264,"label":"command","start_offset":63,"end_offset":68},{"id":92265,"label":"command","start_offset":82,"end_offset":87}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230743,"text":"Again, I'm going to do this quickly because you know this from other parts of the class.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230745,"text":"So what's our final equation?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230746,"text":"Our final equation is <EQUATION>.So this is our best fit quadratic equation through the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230747,"text":"Now before I end, let me do a couple things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230748,"text":"First, let me go back and review what the key steps were.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230749,"text":"Whenever you're faced with such a best fit equation, first, you want to see what the general form of the equation is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230750,"text":"Next you want to write it in terms of matrices.","entities":[{"id":92268,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230751,"text":"Write down your matrix <EXPRESSION> and your vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92269,"label":"command","start_offset":0,"end_offset":5}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230753,"text":"And then all you have to do is just a computation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230754,"text":"But it might also be worth noting that these three points certainly aren't on this quadratic equation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230756,"text":"But that's OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230757,"text":"This is as close as we can do.So again, welcome back.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230758,"text":"And today's topic is a continuation of what we did last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230759,"text":"We still have a little bit of work and thinking to do concerning polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230760,"text":"So we're going to talk about polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230761,"text":"And my first job today is to talk a little bit about area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230762,"text":"That's something we didn't mention last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230763,"text":"And since we're all back from Thanksgiving, we can certainly talk about it in terms of a pie.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230764,"text":"Which is the basic idea for area in polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230765,"text":"Here's our pie, and here's a slice of the pie.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230766,"text":"The slice has a piece of arc length on it, which I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230767,"text":"And the area of that shaded-in slice, I'm going to call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230768,"text":"And let's suppose that the radius is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230769,"text":"Little <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230770,"text":"So this is a pie of radius <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230771,"text":"That's our picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230772,"text":"Now, it's pretty easy to figure out what the area that slice of pie is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230773,"text":"The total area is, of course, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230774,"text":"We know that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230776,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION> \/ This is the fraction of area-- sorry, fraction of the total circumference, the total length around the rim.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230777,"text":"And then we multiply that by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92275,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230778,"text":"And that's giving us the total area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230779,"text":"And if you work that out, that's <EXPRESSION> =, the <EXPRESSION> cancel and we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92276,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":72}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230780,"text":"So here's the basic formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230781,"text":"And now what we need to do is to talk about a variable pie here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230782,"text":"That would be a pie with a kind of a wavy crust.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230783,"text":"Which is coming around like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230784,"text":"So <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230785,"text":"The distance from the center is varying with the place where we are, the angle where we're shooting out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230786,"text":"And now I want to subdivide that into little chunks here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230787,"text":"Now, the idea for adding up the area, the total area of this piece that's swept out, is to break it up into little slices whose areas are almost easy to calculate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230791,"text":"So here's a circular arc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230792,"text":"And then here's another circular arc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230793,"text":"And here's another circular arc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230794,"text":"It's just right on the nose in that case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230795,"text":"Now, in these two cases, so basically the picture that I'm trying to draw for you is this.","entities":[{"id":92281,"label":"command","start_offset":69,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230796,"text":"I have some sector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230797,"text":"And then I have some circular arc.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230798,"text":"And maybe it takes a little extra.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230799,"text":"There's a little extra area, I'm making an error in the area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230800,"text":"This is a little extra area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230801,"text":"And maybe to draw it the other way.","entities":[{"id":92282,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230802,"text":"I'm a little short on this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230804,"text":"I have the same arc as the curve of the surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230805,"text":"Now this is a little bit like the step functions that we used in Riemann sums.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230806,"text":"It's practically the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230808,"text":"It'll get closer and closer to the curve itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230809,"text":"So that area will tend to <EXPRESSION> in the limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230810,"text":"So we don't have to worry about it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230811,"text":"And the approximate relationship is sitting here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230812,"text":"Where this distance now is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230813,"text":"So this radius is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230814,"text":"And this is this <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230815,"text":"And so in the approximate case, what we have is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230816,"text":"Which is practically the same thing we had here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230817,"text":"Except that that <EXPRESSION> is replacing the constant there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230818,"text":"And it's approximately true, because <EXPRESSION> is varying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230819,"text":"And then in the limit, we have the exact formula for the differential.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230820,"text":"Which is this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230821,"text":"So this is the main formula for area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230822,"text":"And if you like, the total area then is going to be the integral from some starting place to some end place of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92287,"label":"method","start_offset":56,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230823,"text":"Now, this is only useful in the situation that we're in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230824,"text":"Namely-- So this is the other important formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230825,"text":"And this is only useful when <EXPRESSION> is a function of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230826,"text":"When this is the way in which the region is presented to us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230827,"text":"So that's the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230828,"text":"And that's our main formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230829,"text":"Let's do what example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230831,"text":"Which was this formula here.Remember, that was the same as <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230832,"text":"So this is what we did last time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230833,"text":"We connected this rectangular representation to that polar representation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230834,"text":"And the picture is of a circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230836,"text":"So let's figure out what the area is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230838,"text":"So that's something we can get from the picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230839,"text":"You can also get it directly from this formula if you realize that <EXPRESSION> is positive in this range here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230840,"text":"And at the ends, it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230841,"text":"So the thing encloses a region at these ends.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230842,"text":"So at the ends, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230843,"text":"That's what cinches this up like a little sack, if you like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230844,"text":"So the area is now going to be the integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, that's <EXPRESSION>.STUDENT:How do I know from looking at the picture that I'm going from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>, is the question.","entities":[{"id":92291,"label":"method","start_offset":35,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230845,"text":"I do it with my whole body.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230847,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230848,"text":"I sweep up, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230849,"text":"And I get all the way up to here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230850,"text":"that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230851,"text":"So that's the way I do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230852,"text":"That's really the way I do it, I'm being honest.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230853,"text":"Now if you're a machine, you can't actually look.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230854,"text":"And you don't have a body, so you can't point your arms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230855,"text":"Then you would have to go by the formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230857,"text":"The fact that this is where the loop cinches up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230858,"text":"This is where the radius comes into <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230859,"text":"At <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230860,"text":"So you need to know that in order to understand the range.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230861,"text":"Another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230863,"text":"I'm probably going to give you some clues as to what's going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230864,"text":"Because it's very hard to figure these things out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230866,"text":"That's the kind of thing that I could do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230867,"text":"Here, you really should know this one in advance.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230868,"text":"This is by far the most-- or this is one of the typical cases, anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230869,"text":"I'm going to give you a couple more examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230870,"text":"Don't get too worked up over this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230871,"text":"You will somehow be able to visualize it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230872,"text":"I'll give you some examples to help you out with it later.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230873,"text":"So here's the situation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230874,"text":"Here's my integral.","entities":[{"id":92297,"label":"method","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230875,"text":"And now we're faced with a trig integral.","entities":[{"id":92298,"label":"method","start_offset":32,"end_offset":40}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230876,"text":"Which we have to remember how to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230877,"text":"Now, the trig integral here-- so first let me factor out the constants.","entities":[{"id":92299,"label":"method","start_offset":14,"end_offset":22},{"id":92300,"label":"command","start_offset":46,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230878,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION> integral from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92301,"label":"method","start_offset":43,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230879,"text":"And now you have to remember what you're supposed to do at this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230880,"text":"So think, if you haven't done it yet, this is practice you need to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230881,"text":"This trig integral is handled by a double angle formula.","entities":[{"id":92302,"label":"method","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230882,"text":"As it happens, I'm going to be giving you these formulas on the review sheet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230883,"text":"You'll see they're written on the review sheet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230884,"text":"At least in some form.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230885,"text":"So for example, there's a formula, and this will be on the exam, too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230887,"text":"Is that this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230889,"text":"That serves as a little review of trig integrals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230890,"text":"And now, this is quite easy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230891,"text":"This integral now is easy.","entities":[{"id":92306,"label":"method","start_offset":5,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230892,"text":"Why is it easy?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230893,"text":"Well, because it's the antiderivative of a constant, <EXPRESSION>, its antiderivative you're supposed to be able to write down.","entities":[{"id":92307,"label":"method","start_offset":23,"end_offset":37},{"id":92308,"label":"method","start_offset":71,"end_offset":85},{"id":92309,"label":"command","start_offset":116,"end_offset":121}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230894,"text":"So the antiderivative of <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92310,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230895,"text":"And the antiderivative of the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION> the sine when it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92311,"label":"method","start_offset":8,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230896,"text":"And that is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230897,"text":"And the signs go away because they're both <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230898,"text":"So all told we get <EXPRESSION>, which is certainly what we would like it to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230899,"text":"It's the area of the circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230900,"text":"Another question?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230904,"text":"It's where I guess you could say I stuck my elbow there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230905,"text":"Now, the reason is that it's the place where <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230906,"text":"So it's more or less the center of the universe from the point of view of this problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230907,"text":"So it's the reference point and if you like, when you're doing this, it's a little bit like a radar screen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230908,"text":"Everything is centered at the origin and you're taking rays coming out from it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230909,"text":"And seeing where they're going to go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230910,"text":"So for example, this is the <EQUATION> ray, this is the <EQUATION> ray.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230911,"text":"This the <EQUATION> ray.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230912,"text":"And indeed, if my elbow is right at this center here, I'm pointing in those various directions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230913,"text":"So that's what I had in mind when I did that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230914,"text":"You can always get these formulas, by the way, from the original business, <EQUATION>, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230915,"text":"But it's useful to have the geometric picture as well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230916,"text":"In other words, if you were a machine you'd have to rely on these formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230917,"text":"And plot things using these.Now, in terms of plotting I want to expand your brain a little bit.","entities":[{"id":92316,"label":"command","start_offset":4,"end_offset":8},{"id":92317,"label":"command","start_offset":64,"end_offset":70}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230918,"text":"So we need just a little bit more practice with plotting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230919,"text":"In polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230920,"text":"And so, the first question that I want to ask you is, what happens outside of this range of <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230921,"text":"In other words, what happens if <EXPRESSION> beyond <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230922,"text":"Can somebody see what's happening to the formulas in that case?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230923,"text":"So what I'm looking at now, let's go back to it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230924,"text":"What I'm looking at is this formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230925,"text":"But to use the elbow analogy here, I'm swept around like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230926,"text":"But now I'm going to point this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230927,"text":"I'm going to point out over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230928,"text":"My hand is up here in the northwest direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230929,"text":"So what's going to happen?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230930,"text":"Somebody want to tell me?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230932,"text":"That's right.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230933,"text":"What happens is that when <EXPRESSION> crosses this vertical, <EQUATION>, when it crosses over here it goes negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230934,"text":"So although my theta is pointing me this way, the thing is going to go backwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230935,"text":"And there's another clue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230936,"text":"Which is very important.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230937,"text":"How far backwards is it going?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230938,"text":"Well, you don't actually need to know anything but this equation here, to understand that it has to be on the same circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230939,"text":"So when I'm pointing this way, the things points backwards to this point over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230940,"text":"So what happens is, it goes around once.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230941,"text":"And then when I point out this way, it sweeps around a second time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230942,"text":"It just keeps on going around the same circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230943,"text":"So over here it's empty.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230944,"text":"Because it's pointing the other way and it's sweeping around the same curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230945,"text":"A second time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230947,"text":"Because you would have swept it out twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230948,"text":"So that's the mistake that you'll make.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230949,"text":"Sometimes you'll count things as negative and positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230951,"text":"And you'll always over-count if you go too far.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230952,"text":"So that's what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230953,"text":"Again, it sweeps out the same region.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230954,"text":"That's because these two equations really are equivalent to each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230955,"text":"It's just that this one sweeps it out twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230956,"text":"And this one doesn't say how it's sweeping it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230957,"text":"Yeah, another question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230959,"text":"Does the integration work if you just go from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[{"id":92324,"label":"method","start_offset":9,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230960,"text":"The answer is yes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230961,"text":"That's a very weird object, though.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230962,"text":"Let me just show you what that is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230963,"text":"If you started from <EXPRESSION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230964,"text":"So I'll illustrate it on here.","entities":[{"id":92325,"label":"command","start_offset":8,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230965,"text":"The first thing that you swept out between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> is this part here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230966,"text":"That was swept out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230967,"text":"And then, when you're going around this next quadrant here, you're actually sweeping out this underside here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230968,"text":"So actually, you're getting it because you're getting half of it on one half, and getting the other half on the other quadrant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230969,"text":"So it's actually giving you the right answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230970,"text":"That turns out to be OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230971,"text":"It's a little weird way to chop up a circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230972,"text":"But it's legal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230973,"text":"But of course, that's an accident of this particular figure.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230974,"text":"You can't count on that happening.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230975,"text":"It's much better to line it up exactly with what the figure does.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230976,"text":"So don't do that too often.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230977,"text":"You might run into troubles.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230978,"text":"So I'm going to give you a couple more examples of practice with these pictures.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230979,"text":"And maybe I'm going to get rid of this one up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230980,"text":"So here's another favorite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230981,"text":"Here's another favorite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230984,"text":"And now we're really not going to try to do any more area examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230985,"text":"The area examples are actually straightforward.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230986,"text":"It's really just figuring out what the picture looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230987,"text":"So this is examples of drawings.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230988,"text":"So this one is one that's kind of fun to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230989,"text":"This is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230990,"text":"Something like this is on your homework.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230991,"text":"And so what happens here is the following.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230992,"text":"What happens here is that at <EQUATION>, that's the first place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230993,"text":"So let's just plot a few places here.","entities":[{"id":92328,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230994,"text":"I'm not going to plot very many.","entities":[{"id":92329,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230995,"text":"<EQUATION>, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230996,"text":"Whoops, I get <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.And then <EXPRESSION>, that's where I get <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230997,"text":"For this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":230998,"text":"And then again, at <EXPRESSION> I get <EXPRESSION>, which is back at <EXPRESSION> again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231001,"text":"So what it does is, it starts out at <EXPRESSION> and it goes out to the radius <EXPRESSION> over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231002,"text":"And then it comes back.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231003,"text":"So it does something like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231004,"text":"It goes out, and it comes back.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231005,"text":"Now because of the symmetries of the sine function, this is pretty much all you need to know.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231006,"text":"It does something similar in all of the quadrants.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231007,"text":"But in order to see what it's doing, it's useful for you to watch me draw it.","entities":[{"id":92336,"label":"command","start_offset":69,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231008,"text":"Because the order is very important for understanding what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231009,"text":"It's similar to this weird business with the circle here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231010,"text":"So watch me draw this guy.","entities":[{"id":92337,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231011,"text":"I'll draw it in red because it usually has a name.","entities":[{"id":92338,"label":"command","start_offset":5,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231012,"text":"So here it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231013,"text":"It does this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231014,"text":"And then it does this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231015,"text":"And then it does this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231016,"text":"And then it does that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231017,"text":"So it's called a four-leaf rose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231018,"text":"I drew it in pink because it's kind of a rose here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231019,"text":"So it started out over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231020,"text":"This is Step 1.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231021,"text":"And this is the range <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>; <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231022,"text":"It did this part here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231023,"text":"And then it went <EXPRESSION> here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231024,"text":"So I should draw these in white, because they're harder to read in red.","entities":[{"id":92339,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231025,"text":"But now look at what it did.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231026,"text":"It did not make a right angle turn.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231027,"text":"It was nice and smooth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231028,"text":"It went around here and then it went down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231029,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231030,"text":"Back here, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231033,"text":"And then around here, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231034,"text":"And down here, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231035,"text":"And then back where it started and goes around again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231036,"text":"And this is because actually it's switching sign when it crosses the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231037,"text":"When it was over in this quadrant the first time, it actually was tracing what's directly behind it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231038,"text":"So this is kind of amusing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231039,"text":"From this little tiny formula you get this pretty diagram here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231040,"text":"Anyway that's, as I say, an old favorite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231041,"text":"And here if you want to do the area of one leaf, you've got to make sure you understand that it's a small piece of the whole.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231042,"text":"OK, now I have one last drawing example that I want to discuss with you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231043,"text":"And it involves another skill that we haven't quite gotten enough practice with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231044,"text":"So I'm going to do that one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231045,"text":"And it's also preparation for an exercise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231046,"text":"But one that we're going to do after the test.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231047,"text":"So here's my last example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231048,"text":"We're going to discuss what happens with this function here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231049,"text":"Sorry, that's not legible, is it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231050,"text":"That's a <EXPRESSION>.Now, the first thing I want to do is just take our time a little bit and plot a few points.","entities":[{"id":92344,"label":"command","start_offset":95,"end_offset":99}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231051,"text":"So here's the values of <EXPRESSION> and here are the values of <EXPRESSION>, and we'll see what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231052,"text":"And we'll try to figure out what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231053,"text":"When <EQUATION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231059,"text":"So that value of <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231060,"text":"And now I'm going to back up and do <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231061,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, again, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231062,"text":"And <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231093,"text":"Those ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231094,"text":"OK that's about as much as we'll be able to figure out of this diagram without doing some analytic work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231095,"text":"And that's the other little piece that I want to explain.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231097,"text":"Which is one thing that we haven't done.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231098,"text":"So let's do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231099,"text":"So what is the rectangular equation?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231100,"text":"That means the (x, y) equation for this <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231101,"text":"And let's see what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231102,"text":"Well, first I'm going to clear the denominator here.","entities":[{"id":92358,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":35,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231103,"text":"This is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231105,"text":"And the reason for that is that in a minute I'll explain to you why.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231106,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231107,"text":"And this guy, I'm going to square now.","entities":[{"id":92360,"label":"method","start_offset":27,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231108,"text":"I'm going to make this <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231109,"text":"And now, with an <EXPRESSION>, I can plug in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231110,"text":"So this is a standard thing to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231111,"text":"And it's basically what you're going to do any time you're faced with an equation like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231112,"text":"Is try to work it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231113,"text":"And, in these situations where you have <EXPRESSION>, or <EXPRESSION>, you'll always come out with some quadratic expression like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231114,"text":"Now, I'm going to combine terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231115,"text":"So here I have <EXPRESSION>, and put everything on the the left side.","entities":[{"id":92361,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":59,"end_offset":68}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231116,"text":"So that's this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231117,"text":"And we recognize, well you're supposed to recognize, that this is what's known as a hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231118,"text":"If the signs are the same, it's an ellipse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231119,"text":"If the the signs are opposite it's a hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231120,"text":"And in between, if one of the coefficients on the quadratic is <EXPRESSION>, it's a parabola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231121,"text":"So now we see that the picture that we drew there is actually, turns out it's going to have asymptotes, it's going to be a hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231122,"text":"So now, let me ask you the last little mind-bending question that I want to ask.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231123,"text":"Which is, what happens-- So now I'm using my right arm, I guess.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231124,"text":"But my elbow's at the origin here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231130,"text":"Good answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231131,"text":"It's the other branch of the hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231132,"text":"So what's actually happening is in disguise, there's another branch of the hyperbola which is being swept up by the other piece of this thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231133,"text":"Now, that is consistent with these algebraic equations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231134,"text":"The algebraic equation that I got here doesn't say which branch of the hyperbola I've got.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231135,"text":"It's actually got two branches.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231137,"text":"I want to make the connection now with the basic formula for area here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231138,"text":"Because this is a really beautiful connection.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231139,"text":"And I want to make that connection in connection also with this example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231140,"text":"The hyperbolas, as you probably know, are the trajectories of comets.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231142,"text":"But there's actually something much more important, physically that goes on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231143,"text":"That's special about this particular representation of the hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231145,"text":"Which is that in this case, <EQUATION> is the focus of the hyperbola.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231146,"text":"And what that means is that it's actually the place where the sun is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231147,"text":"So this is the right representation, if you want the center of gravity in the center of your picture.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231148,"text":"And pretty much any other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231149,"text":"I mean, you can't tell that at all from the algebraic equations here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231150,"text":"So this hyperbola is going to be the trajectory of some comet going by here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231151,"text":"And this formula here is actually a rather central formula in astronomy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231152,"text":"Namely, there's something called Kepler's Law.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231153,"text":"Which says that the rate of change of area which is swept out is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231154,"text":"The rate of change of area relative to the center of mass, relative to the sun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231156,"text":"So this tells you now that when a comet goes around the sun like this, its speed varies.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231157,"text":"And it's speed varies according to a very specific rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231158,"text":"Namely, this one here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231159,"text":"And this rule was observed by Kepler.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231160,"text":"But if you have this connection here, we also have something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231161,"text":"We also know that <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231162,"text":"So that's this formula here, formally dividing by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231163,"text":"That's the rate of change with respect to this time parameter, which is the honest to goodness time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231164,"text":"Real physical time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231165,"text":"And that means, this quantity here is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231167,"text":"Outer space, there's no air.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231168,"text":"Nothing is going on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231169,"text":"This is what's known nowadays as conservation of angular momentum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231170,"text":"This is the expression for angular momentum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231171,"text":"And what Kepler was observing, it turns out, is what we see all the time in real life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231172,"text":"Which is when you start something spinning around it continues to spin at roughly the same rate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231173,"text":"Or, if you're an ice skater and you get yourself scrunched together a little bit more, you can spin faster.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231174,"text":"And there's an exact quantitative rule that does that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231175,"text":"And it's exactly this polar formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231176,"text":"So that's a neat thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231177,"text":"And we will do a little exercise on this rate of change after the exam.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231178,"text":"So that's it for generalities and a little pep talk on what's coming up to you when you learn a little more physics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231179,"text":"Right now we need to talk about the exam.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231180,"text":"So first of all, let me tell you what the topics are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231181,"text":"They're the same as last year's test.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231182,"text":"Which you can take a look at.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231183,"text":"And let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231184,"text":"So what did we do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231185,"text":"One of the main topics of this unit were techniques of integration.","entities":[{"id":92373,"label":"method","start_offset":55,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231186,"text":"And there are three, which we will test.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231187,"text":"One is trig substitution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231188,"text":"One is integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":92374,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":27}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231189,"text":"And one is partial fractions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231190,"text":"So that's more than half of the exam, right there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231191,"text":"The other half of the exam is parametric curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231192,"text":"Arc length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231193,"text":"These are all interrelated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231194,"text":"And area of surfaces of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231195,"text":"Those are the only kind that we can handle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231196,"text":"Just as we did with volume of surfaces of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231197,"text":"And then there's a final topic, which is polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231198,"text":"And area in polar coordinates, including area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231199,"text":"That's it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231200,"text":"That's what's on the test, there are six problems.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231201,"text":"They're very similar.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231202,"text":"Well, they're not actually that similar.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231203,"text":"But they're somewhat similar to last year's.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231205,"text":"Maybe a tiny bit more difficult.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231206,"text":"We'll see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231208,"text":"And the answer is no, we did not.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231209,"text":"We did not do arc length in polar coordinates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231210,"text":"When I give you an exercise, I'm going to ask you about, if you know the speed of a comet here, what's the speed of the comet there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231211,"text":"And we'll have to know about arc length for that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231212,"text":"But we're not doing it on this exam.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231213,"text":"Other questions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231215,"text":"It's related to this four-leaf rose here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231216,"text":"So the question is, suppose I gave you something that looked like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231217,"text":"Would I expect you to be able to know what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231218,"text":"I think the answer, the fair answer to give you, is if it's this complicated, I only have two possibilities.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231219,"text":"I can give you a long time to sketch this out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231220,"text":"And think about what it does.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231221,"text":"Or I can tell you that it happens to be a three-leaf rose.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231222,"text":"And then you have some clue as to what it's doing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231223,"text":"It doesn't have six.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231224,"text":"Because of some weird thing, having to do with repetitions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231225,"text":"But the odds and evens work differently.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231226,"text":"So, in fact I would have to tell you what the picture looks like, if it's going to be this complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231229,"text":"Or I'm going to tell you, don't do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231230,"text":"If I tell you don't do it, don't try to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231231,"text":"It may be impossible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231232,"text":"And even if it's possible, it's going to be very long.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231233,"text":"Like an hour.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231234,"text":"So don't do it unless I tell you to.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231235,"text":"On the other hand, all of these setups in this second half of this unit, they involve somehow setting something up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231236,"text":"And they're basically three issues.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231237,"text":"One is what the integrand is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231238,"text":"One is what the lower limit is, what is the upper limit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231239,"text":"They're just three things, three inputs, to setting up an integral.","entities":[{"id":92383,"label":"method","start_offset":58,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231240,"text":"All integrals, this is going to be the setup for all of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231241,"text":"And then the second step is evaluating.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231242,"text":"Which really is what we did in the first half here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231243,"text":"And, unfortunately, we don't have infinitely many techniques and indeed there's some integrals that can't be evaluated and some that are too long.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231244,"text":"So we'll just try to avoid those.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231245,"text":"I'm not trying to give you ones which are hopelessly long.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231247,"text":"And the answer is, no.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231248,"text":"I'll tell you exactly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231249,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION> points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231250,"text":"Unless I change the point values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231251,"text":"This is <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231252,"text":"That's what it came out to be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231253,"text":"You are going to want to know about all of the things that I've written down here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231254,"text":"You're definitely going to want to know, for example, surfaces of revolution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231256,"text":"So what's going to happen is, you're going to need a coefficient for each degree of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231257,"text":"So altogether, the setup is going to be this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231258,"text":"<EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231259,"text":"And <EXPRESSION> for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231260,"text":"This is the setup.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231262,"text":"I need that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231263,"text":"Now, it gets harder and harder.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231264,"text":"The more repeated roots there are, the more repeated factors there are, the harder it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231265,"text":"Because the ones you can pick off by the cover-up method are, is just the top one here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231266,"text":"And these two.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231267,"text":"So <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> you can get.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231268,"text":"But <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you're going to have to do by either plugging in or some other, more elaborate, algebra.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231269,"text":"So the more of these lower terms there are, the worse off you are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231271,"text":"And the answer is almost no.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231272,"text":"That is, not at all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231273,"text":"It's the same setup exactly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231274,"text":"But, there's one thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231276,"text":"I'll give you an example of this type of practice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231278,"text":"Anything that's a little out of the ordinary like a reduction formula, I will have to coach you to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231279,"text":"So, in other words, what you'll have to be able to do in that situation is follow directions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231280,"text":"If I tell you OK, you're faced with this, then do an integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":92389,"label":"method","start_offset":53,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231281,"text":"And do that, then get the reduction formula.OK, so the question had do with the partial fractions method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231282,"text":"And what happens if you have a quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231283,"text":"So, for instance, if it were this, this one's too disgusting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231284,"text":"I'm going to just do it with two of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231285,"text":"So the parts with <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231286,"text":"But now you have linear factors here.And <EXPRESSION>-- maybe I'll call them <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231287,"text":"This is the way it works.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231288,"text":"OK, I'm going to give you one more quick example of an integration technique just to liven things up.","entities":[{"id":92391,"label":"method","start_offset":55,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231289,"text":"Let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231290,"text":"So here's a somewhat tricky example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231291,"text":"This is just a little trickier than I would give you on a test.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231292,"text":"But it's the same principle, and I may do this on a final exam.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231293,"text":"So suppose you're faced with this integral.","entities":[{"id":92392,"label":"method","start_offset":34,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231294,"text":"What are you going to do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231295,"text":"Integration by parts, great.","entities":[{"id":92393,"label":"method","start_offset":0,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231296,"text":"That's right, that's because this guy is begging to be differentiated, to be made simpler.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231297,"text":"So that means that I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>, and I want this one to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231298,"text":"And I want to use integration by parts.","entities":[{"id":92395,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":17},{"id":92396,"label":"method","start_offset":18,"end_offset":38}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231299,"text":"And then <EQUATION>, and <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231300,"text":"So the answer is now, <EXPRESSION> minus the integral of this guy.","entities":[{"id":92397,"label":"command","start_offset":35,"end_offset":40},{"id":92398,"label":"method","start_offset":45,"end_offset":53}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231301,"text":"Which is going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231302,"text":"And then I have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231303,"text":"Now, you are not done at this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231304,"text":"You're still in slightly hot water.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231305,"text":"You're in tepid water, anyway.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231306,"text":"So what is it that you have to do here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231307,"text":"You're faced with this integral, which I'll put on the next board.","entities":[{"id":92399,"label":"method","start_offset":23,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231308,"text":"It's a lot simpler than the other one, but as I say you're not quite out of the woods.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231309,"text":"You're faced with the integral of <EXPRESSION>.STUDENT:Trig substitution actually, interestingly, will work.","entities":[{"id":92401,"label":"method","start_offset":22,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231310,"text":"But that wasn't what I wanted you to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231311,"text":"I wanted you to, yeah, go ahead.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231313,"text":"So now, that's the correct answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231314,"text":"This is the case where the numerator and the denominator are tied.","entities":[{"id":92405,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":27,"end_offset":36},{"id":92406,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":45,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231316,"text":"But a shortcut is just to observe that the result of long division is the same thing as doing this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231317,"text":"And then noticing that this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231318,"text":"So this is the same as long division, in this case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231319,"text":"Because when you divide in, it goes in with a quotient of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92408,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231320,"text":"And so this guy turns out to be <EXPRESSION> the integral of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92409,"label":"method","start_offset":49,"end_offset":57}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231321,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231322,"text":"So this is one extra step that you may be faced with someday in your life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231323,"text":"And just keep that in mind.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231327,"text":"So here's the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231328,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION> is approximately = to its value at a base point plus the derivative times <EXPRESSION>.So this is the main formula.","entities":[{"id":92412,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":70},{"id":92413,"label":"method","start_offset":75,"end_offset":85},{"id":92414,"label":"command","start_offset":86,"end_offset":91}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231329,"text":"For right now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231330,"text":"Put it in a box.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231331,"text":"And let me just describe what it means, first.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231332,"text":"And then I'll describe what it means again, and several other times.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231333,"text":"So, first of all, what it means is that if you have a curve, which is <EQUATION>, it's approximately the same as its tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231334,"text":"So this other side is the equation of the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231335,"text":"So let's give an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231338,"text":"That's pretty much the only place where we know the logarithm for sure.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231339,"text":"And so, what we plug in here now, are the values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231340,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231341,"text":"Or, sorry, <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231342,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>, well, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231344,"text":"I evaluated the coefficients and this is the dependent variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231345,"text":"So, all told, if you like, what I have here is that the logarithm of <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231346,"text":"And let me draw a picture of this.","entities":[{"id":92421,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231347,"text":"So here's the graph of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92422,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231348,"text":"And then, I'll draw in the tangent line at the place that we're considering, which is <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92423,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231349,"text":"So here's the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231350,"text":"And I've separated a little bit, but really I probably should have drawn it a little closer there, to show you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231351,"text":"The whole point is that these two are nearby.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231352,"text":"But they're not nearby everywhere.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231353,"text":"So this is the line <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231354,"text":"Right, that's the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231355,"text":"They're nearby only when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231357,"text":"So when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>, this is true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231359,"text":"But near this place they're close together.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231360,"text":"So the idea, again, is that the curve, the curved line, is approximately the tangent line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231361,"text":"And this is one example of it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231362,"text":"All right, so I want to explain this in one more way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231363,"text":"And then we want to discuss it systematically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231364,"text":"So the second way that I want to describe this requires me to remind you what the definition of the derivative is.","entities":[{"id":92428,"label":"method","start_offset":100,"end_offset":110}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231365,"text":"So, the definition of a derivative is that it's the limit, as <EXPRESSION> goes to <EXPRESSION>, of <EXPRESSION>, that's one way of writing it, all right?","entities":[{"id":92429,"label":"method","start_offset":24,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231366,"text":"And this is the way we defined it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231367,"text":"And one of the things that we did in the first unit was we looked at this backwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231368,"text":"We used the derivative knowing the derivatives of functions to evaluate some limits.","entities":[{"id":92430,"label":"method","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231369,"text":"So you were supposed to do that on your.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231370,"text":"In our test, there were some examples there, at least one example, where that was the easiest way to do the problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231371,"text":"So in other words, you can read this equation both ways.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231372,"text":"This is really, of course, the same equation written twice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231374,"text":"So this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231375,"text":"So that, I claim, is the same as what's in the box in pink that I have over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231376,"text":"So this approximation formula here is the same as this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231377,"text":"This is an average rate of change, and this is an infinitesimal rate of change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231378,"text":"And they're nearly the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231379,"text":"That's the claim.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231381,"text":"And I will, as I said, I'll be illustrating this a little bit today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231382,"text":"Now, let me just explain why those two formulas in the boxes are the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231383,"text":"So let's just start over here and explain that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231384,"text":"So the smaller box is the same thing if I multiply through by <EXPRESSION>, as <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92434,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":50}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231385,"text":"And now if I just write out what this is, it's <EXPRESSION>, right, <EXPRESSION>, I'm going to write it this way.","entities":[{"id":92435,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23},{"id":92437,"label":"command","start_offset":95,"end_offset":100}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231386,"text":"Which is approximately <EXPRESSION>, and this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231387,"text":"So here I'm using the notations <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231388,"text":"And so this is the change in <EXPRESSION>, this is just rewriting what <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231389,"text":"And now the last step is just to put the constant on the other side.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231390,"text":"So <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231391,"text":"So this is exactly what I had just to begin with, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231392,"text":"So these two are just algebraically the same statement.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231393,"text":"That's one another way of looking at it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231394,"text":"All right, so now, I want to go through some systematic discussion here of several linear approximations, which you're going to be wanting to memorize.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231395,"text":"And rather than it's being hard to memorize these, it's supposed to remind you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231396,"text":"So that you'll have a lot of extra reinforcement in remembering derivatives of all kinds.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231397,"text":"So, when we carry out these systematic discussions, we want to make things absolutely as simple as possible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231399,"text":"So I'm always going to have <EQUATION> in this standard list of formulas that I'm going to use.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231400,"text":"And if I put <EQUATION>, then this formula becomes <EXPRESSION>, a little bit simpler to read.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231401,"text":"It becomes <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231402,"text":"So this is probably the form that you'll want to remember most.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231403,"text":"That's again, just the linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231404,"text":"But one always has to remember, and this is a very important thing, this one only worked near <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231405,"text":"This approximation here really only works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231406,"text":"So that's a little addition that you need to throw in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231407,"text":"So this one works when <EXPRESSION> is near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231408,"text":"You can't expect it to be true far away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231409,"text":"The curve can go anywhere it wants, when it's far away from the point of tangency.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231410,"text":"So, OK, so let's work this out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231411,"text":"Let's do it for the sine function, for the cosine function, and for <EXPRESSION>, to begin with.Question.JERISON: Yeah.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231412,"text":"When does this one work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231413,"text":"Well, so the question was, when does this one work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231414,"text":"Again, this is when <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231416,"text":"<EXPRESSION> going to <EXPRESSION> is the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231417,"text":"<EXPRESSION> small.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231418,"text":"So another way of saying it is, the <EXPRESSION> is small.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231419,"text":"Now, exactly what we mean by small will also be explained.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231420,"text":"But it is a matter to some extent of intuition as to how much, how good it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231421,"text":"In practical cases, people will really care about how small it is before the approximation is useful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231422,"text":"And that's a serious issue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231423,"text":"All right, so let me carry out these approximations for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231424,"text":"Again, this is always for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231425,"text":"So all of these are going to be for <EXPRESSION> near <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231426,"text":"So in order to make this computation, I have to evaluate the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231427,"text":"I need to plug in two numbers here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231428,"text":"In order to get this expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231429,"text":"I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is and I need to know what <EXPRESSION> is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231434,"text":"<EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231435,"text":"So there we go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231436,"text":"So now we have the coefficients <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231437,"text":"So this number is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231438,"text":"And this number is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231439,"text":"So what we get here is <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231440,"text":"There's the linear approximation to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231441,"text":"Similarly, so now this is a routine matter to just read this off for this table.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231442,"text":"We'll do it for the cosine function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231443,"text":"If you differentiate the cosine, what you get is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92447,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231445,"text":"The value of this <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231446,"text":"So this is going back over here, <EXPRESSION>, so this is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231447,"text":"This linear function happens to be constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231449,"text":"So both of the terms here, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, they're both <EXPRESSION> and we get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231450,"text":"So these are the linear approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231451,"text":"You can memorize these.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231452,"text":"You'll probably remember them either this way or that way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231453,"text":"This collection of information here encodes the same collection of information as we have over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231454,"text":"For the values of the function and the values of their derivatives at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231455,"text":"So let me just emphasize again the geometric point of view by drawing pictures of these results.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231456,"text":"So first of all, for the sine function, here's the sine - well, close enough.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231457,"text":"So that's - boy, now that is quite some sine, isn't it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231458,"text":"I should try to make the two bumps be the same height, roughly speaking.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231459,"text":"Anyway the tangent line we're talking about is here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231460,"text":"And this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231461,"text":"And this is the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231462,"text":"And near <EXPRESSION>, those things coincide pretty closely.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231463,"text":"The cosine function, I'll put that underneath, I guess.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231464,"text":"I think I can fit it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231465,"text":"Make it a little smaller here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231466,"text":"So for the cosine function, we're up here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231467,"text":"It's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231468,"text":"Well, no wonder the tangent line is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231469,"text":"It's horizontal.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231470,"text":"The tangent line is horizontal, so the function corresponding is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231471,"text":"So this is <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231472,"text":"And finally, if I draw <EQUATION>, that's coming down like this.","entities":[{"id":92452,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231475,"text":"The value is <EXPRESSION> and the slope is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231477,"text":"This analytic picture is extremely important and will help you to deal with sines, cosines and exponentials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231479,"text":"Good question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231480,"text":"We're getting there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231481,"text":"First, we're getting a little library of them and I'll give you a few examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231483,"text":"And a little bit less obvious.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231484,"text":"So, the next couple that we're going to do are <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231486,"text":"And that you need to think about.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231487,"text":"Now, the procedure is the same as over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231488,"text":"Namely, I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION> and I have to write down <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92455,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":23},{"id":92456,"label":"command","start_offset":56,"end_offset":61},{"id":92457,"label":"command","start_offset":94,"end_offset":99}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231489,"text":"And then I'll have the coefficients to be able to fill in what the approximation is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231490,"text":"So <EQUATION>, in the case of the logarithm.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231491,"text":"And <EXPRESSION>, if I plug in, that's <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231492,"text":"And f' if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231493,"text":"And similarly if I do it for this one, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231494,"text":"And when I plug in <EXPRESSION>, I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231495,"text":"And here I get <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231496,"text":"So the corresponding statement here is that <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231498,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION> and here we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231499,"text":"And now, I do want to make a connection, explain to you what's going on here and the connection with the first example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231500,"text":"We already did the logarithm once.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231501,"text":"And let's just point out that these two computations are the same, or practically the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231502,"text":"Here I use the base point <EXPRESSION>, but because of my, sort of, convenient form, which will end up, I claim, being much more convenient for pretty much every purpose, we want to do these things near <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231503,"text":"You cannot expand the logarithm and understand a tangent line for it at <EQUATION>, because it goes down to minus infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231504,"text":"Similarly, if you try to graph <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> without the <EXPRESSION> here, you'll discover that sometimes the slope is infinite, and so forth.","entities":[{"id":92462,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231505,"text":"So this is a bad choice of point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231508,"text":"So the connection with the previous example is that the-- what we wrote before I could write as <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92464,"label":"command","start_offset":87,"end_offset":92}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231509,"text":"Right, that's just recopying what I have over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231518,"text":"And what I'm going to do is just give you one example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231523,"text":"So we'll call this Example 2, maybe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231566,"text":"That's the same thing as saying <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> - of the function <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231568,"text":"And just to combine them algebraically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231569,"text":"So I'm not going to do any calculus, I'm just going to remember.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231570,"text":"So with <EXPRESSION>, it's pretty clear that I should be using this formula for <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231571,"text":"For the other one, it may be slightly less obvious but we have powers of <EXPRESSION> over here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231572,"text":"So let's plug those in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231573,"text":"I'll put this up so that you can remember it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231574,"text":"And we're going to carry out this approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231575,"text":"So, first of all, I'm going to write this so that it's slightly more suggestive.","entities":[{"id":92480,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231576,"text":"Namely, I'm going to write it as a product.","entities":[{"id":92481,"label":"command","start_offset":21,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231577,"text":"And there you can now see the exponent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231580,"text":"x is replaced by <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231581,"text":"And then over here, I can just copy verbatim the other approximation formula with <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231582,"text":"So this is times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92485,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231583,"text":"And now I'm going to carry out the multiplication.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231584,"text":"So this is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231585,"text":"So now, here's our formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231586,"text":"So now this isn't where things stop.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231587,"text":"And indeed, in this kind of arithmetic that I'm describing now, things are easier than they are in ordinary algebra, in arithmetic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231588,"text":"The reason is that there's another step, which I'm now going to perform.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231589,"text":"Which is that I'm going to throw away this term here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231590,"text":"I'm going to ignore it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231591,"text":"In fact, I didn't even have to work it out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231592,"text":"Because I'm going to throw it away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231593,"text":"So the reason is that already, when I passed from this expression to this one, that is from this type of thing to this thing, I was already throwing away quadratic and higher-ordered terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231594,"text":"So this isn't the only quadratic term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231595,"text":"There are tons of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231596,"text":"I have to ignore all of them if I'm going to ignore some of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231597,"text":"And in fact, I only want to be left with the linear stuff.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231598,"text":"Because that's all I'm really getting a valid computation for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231599,"text":"So, this is approximately <EXPRESSION> minus, so let's see.","entities":[{"id":92487,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231600,"text":"It's a total of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231601,"text":"And this is the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231602,"text":"This is the linear part.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231603,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> term is negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231604,"text":"So we drop <EXPRESSION> term.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231605,"text":"Terms, and higher.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231606,"text":"All of those terms should be lower-order.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231607,"text":"If you imagine <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, or maybe <EXPRESSION>, then these terms will end up being much smaller.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231608,"text":"So we have a rather crude approach.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231609,"text":"And that's really the simplicity, and that's the savings.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231610,"text":"So now, since this unit is called Applications, and these are indeed applications to math, I also wanted to give you a real-life application.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231611,"text":"Or a place where linear approximations come up in real life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231612,"text":"So maybe we'll call this Example 4.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231613,"text":"This is supposedly a real-life example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231614,"text":"I'll try to persuade you that it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231615,"text":"So I like this example because it's got a lot of math, as well as physics in it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231616,"text":"So here I am, on the surface of the earth.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231617,"text":"And here is a satellite going this way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231618,"text":"At some velocity, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231619,"text":"And this satellite has a clock on it because this is a GPS satellite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231620,"text":"And it has a time, <EXPRESSION>, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231621,"text":"But I have a watch, in fact it's right here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231622,"text":"And I have a time which I keep.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231623,"text":"Which is <EXPRESSION>, And there's an interesting relationship between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, which is called time dilation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231624,"text":"And this is from special relativity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231625,"text":"And it's the following formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231626,"text":"<EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> is the velocity of the satellite, and <EXPRESSION> is the speed of light.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231627,"text":"So now I'd like to get a rough idea of how different my watch is from the clock on the satellite.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231629,"text":"I'm going to write <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92491,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231630,"text":"But now let me just remind you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231631,"text":"The situation here is, we have something of the form <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231632,"text":"That's what's happening when I multiply through here.","entities":[{"id":92492,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":39}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231633,"text":"So with <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231635,"text":"It can be any physical quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231636,"text":"So in this case it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231637,"text":"And now the approximation formula says that if this is approximately =, well again it's the same rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231638,"text":"There's an <EXPRESSION> and then <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, so this is <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231639,"text":"So this is approximately, by the same rule, this is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION> Now, I promised you that this would be a real-life problem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231640,"text":"So the question is when people were designing these GPS systems, they run clocks in the satellites.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231641,"text":"You're down there, you're making your measurements, you're talking to the satellite by-- or you're receiving its signals from its radio.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231642,"text":"The question is, is this going to cause problems in the transmission.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231643,"text":"And there are dozens of such problems that you have to check for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231644,"text":"So in this case, what actually happened is that <EXPRESSION> is about <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231645,"text":"That's how fast the GPS satellites actually go.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231646,"text":"In fact, they had to decide to put them at a certain altitude and they could've tweaked this if they had put them at different places.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231647,"text":"Anyway, the speed of light is <EXPRESSION> kilometers per second.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231648,"text":"So this number, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231649,"text":"Now, if you actually keep track of how much of an error that would make in a GPS location, what you would find is maybe it's a millimeter or something like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231650,"text":"So in fact it doesn't matter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231651,"text":"So that's nice.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231653,"text":"Exactly this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231654,"text":"And the way that they used it was, they decided that because the clocks were different, when the satellite broadcasts its radio frequency, that frequency would be shifted.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231655,"text":"Would be offset.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231656,"text":"And they decided that the fidelity was so important that they would send the satellites off with this kind of, exactly this, offset.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231657,"text":"To compensate for the way the signal is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231658,"text":"So from the point of view of good reception on your little GPS device, they changed the frequency at which the transmitter in the satellites, according to exactly this rule.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231659,"text":"And incidentally, the reason why they didn't-- they ignored higher-order terms, the sort of quadratic terms, is that if you take <EXPRESSION> that's a size <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92495,"label":"command","start_offset":124,"end_offset":128}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231660,"text":"And that really is totally negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231661,"text":"That doesn't matter to any measurement at all.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231662,"text":"That's on the order of nanometers, and it's not important for any of the uses to which GPS is put.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231664,"text":"I'm going to switch gears and talk about quadratic approximations.","entities":[{"id":92498,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231667,"text":"Suppose I applied the original formula here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231670,"text":"So the answer is, yes, it's also true that if I call this function <EXPRESSION>, then it must be true that the linear approximation is <EXPRESSION> of - I'm sorry, it's at <EXPRESSION>, so it's <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231671,"text":"So that should be true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231672,"text":"That's the formula that we're using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231673,"text":"It's up there in the pink also.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231674,"text":"So this is the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231675,"text":"So now, what about <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231676,"text":"Well, if I plug in <EXPRESSION> here, I get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231677,"text":"So this thing is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231678,"text":"So that's no surprise.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231679,"text":"And that's what I got.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231680,"text":"If I computed <EXPRESSION>, by the product rule it would be an annoying, somewhat long, computation.","entities":[{"id":92502,"label":"method","start_offset":35,"end_offset":47}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231682,"text":"It has to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231684,"text":"This is faster than doing that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231685,"text":"But of course, that's a legal way of doing it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231690,"text":"And then you plug in <EQUATION>, it's gone too.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231691,"text":"And similarly, if you're up here, it goes away and similarly over here it goes away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231693,"text":"This just captures the linear features of the function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231694,"text":"So now I want to go on to quadratic approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231695,"text":"And now we're going to elaborate on this formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231696,"text":"So, linear approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231699,"text":"But now we're going to change it to quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231709,"text":"This time I'll spell 'linear' correctly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231842,"text":"Well, so there are two cases to think about here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231843,"text":"When you're integrating things like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231844,"text":"There's the easy case, and let's do that one first.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231845,"text":"The easy case is when at least one exponent is odd.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231846,"text":"That's the easy case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231847,"text":"So, for example, suppose that I wanted to integrate, well, let's take the case <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":92569,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":51}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231848,"text":"So I'm integrating <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231849,"text":"I'm taking-- Oh, I could do that one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231851,"text":"You were thinking that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231852,"text":"So let's do this case when <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231853,"text":"So the integral I'm trying to do is any power of the <EXPRESSION> times the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":92572,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":15},{"id":92573,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231854,"text":"Well, here's the trick.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231856,"text":"So, the way to exploit that is to make a substitution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231857,"text":"And substitution is going to be <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231858,"text":"And here's why.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231859,"text":"Then this integral that I'm trying to do is the integral of <EXPRESSION>, that's already a simplification.","entities":[{"id":92575,"label":"method","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18},{"id":92576,"label":"method","start_offset":48,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231860,"text":"And then there's that <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231861,"text":"When you make a substitution, you've got to go all the way and replace everything in the expression by things involving this new variable that I've introduced.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231864,"text":"Let me put a box around that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231865,"text":"That's our substitution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231866,"text":"When you make a substitution, you also want to compute the differential of the variable that you substitute in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231867,"text":"So the <EXPRESSION> that appears here is just, exactly, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231868,"text":"And I've replaced this trig integral with something that doesn't involve trig functions at all.","entities":[{"id":92579,"label":"method","start_offset":28,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231870,"text":"We can just plug into what we know here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231874,"text":"You're the one who introduced this variable, you.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231875,"text":"Nobody except you, really, knows what it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231876,"text":"But the rest of the world knows what they asked for the first place that involved <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231877,"text":"So I have to go back and get rid of this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231878,"text":"And that's not hard to do in this case, because <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231879,"text":"And so I make this back substitution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231880,"text":"And that's what you get.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231881,"text":"So there's the answer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231883,"text":"So that's what made this substitution work.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231884,"text":"Let's do another example to see how that works out in a slightly different case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231885,"text":"So here's another example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231886,"text":"Now I do have an odd power.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231887,"text":"One of the exponents is odd, so I'm in the easy case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231888,"text":"But it's not <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":231891,"text":"Watch what happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231892,"text":"So this is not really a substitution or anything, this is just a trig identity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231893,"text":"This <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":231894,"text":"And the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":232941,"text":"The velocity is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232942,"text":"So, at the time, at that particular time, our point is actually not moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232943,"text":"Of course, it's been moving just before, and it starts moving just afterwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232944,"text":"It's just the instant, at that particular instant, the speed is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232945,"text":"So, that's especially maybe a counterintuitive thing, but something is moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232946,"text":"And at that time, it's actually stopped.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232947,"text":"Now, let's see, so that's the vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232948,"text":"And, it's useful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232949,"text":"But, if you want just the usual speed as a number, then, what will you do?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232951,"text":"So, speed, which is the scalar quantity is going to be just the magnitude of the vector, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232952,"text":"OK, so, in this case, while it would be <EXPRESSION>, and if you expand that, you will get, let me take a bit more space, it's going to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93186,"label":"command","start_offset":65,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232953,"text":"It seems to simplify a little bit because we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93189,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232954,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232955,"text":"So, it's going to be the <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232956,"text":"So, at this point, if I was going to ask you, when is the speed the smallest or the largest?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232957,"text":"You could answer based on that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232958,"text":"See, at <EQUATION>, well, that turns out to be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232959,"text":"The point is not moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232960,"text":"At <EQUATION>, that ends up being <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232961,"text":"So, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232962,"text":"And, that's when you're truly at the top of the arch, and that's when the point is moving the fastest.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232965,"text":"Anyway, that's a formula we can get.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232966,"text":"OK, now, what about acceleration?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232967,"text":"So, here I should warn you that there is a serious discrepancy between the usual intuitive notion of acceleration, the one that you are aware of when you drive a car and the one that we will be using.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232968,"text":"So, you might think acceleration is just the directive of speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232969,"text":"If my car goes <EXPRESSION> miles an hour on the highway and it's going a constant speed, it's not accelerating.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232971,"text":"Then, I'm going to feel something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232972,"text":"There is some force being exerted.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232973,"text":"And, in fact, there is a sideways acceleration at that point even though the speed is not changing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232974,"text":"So, the definition will take effect.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232975,"text":"The acceleration is, as a vector, and the acceleration vector is just the derivative of a velocity vector.","entities":[{"id":93196,"label":"method","start_offset":74,"end_offset":84}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232976,"text":"So, even if the speed is constant, that means, even if a length of the velocity vector stays the same, the velocity vector can still rotate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232977,"text":"And, as it rotates, it uses acceleration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232979,"text":"It's a vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232980,"text":"Of course, if you are moving in a straight line, then the two notions are the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232981,"text":"I mean, acceleration is also going to be along the line, and it's going to has to do with the derivative of speed.","entities":[{"id":93197,"label":"method","start_offset":94,"end_offset":104}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232982,"text":"But, in general, that's not quite the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232983,"text":"So, for example, let's look at the cycloid.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232985,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232986,"text":"And, what's the derivative of <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[{"id":93200,"label":"method","start_offset":16,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232987,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232988,"text":"So, the acceleration vector is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232989,"text":"So, in particular, let's look at what happens at time <EQUATION> when the point is not moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232990,"text":"Well, the acceleration vector there will be <EXPRESSION> from <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232991,"text":"So, what that means is that if I look at my trajectory at this point, that the acceleration vector is pointing in that direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232992,"text":"It's the unit vector in the vertical direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232993,"text":"So, my point is not moving at that particular time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232994,"text":"But, it's accelerating up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232995,"text":"So, that means that actually as it comes down, first it's slowing down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232996,"text":"Then it stops here, and then it reverses going back up.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232997,"text":"OK, so that's another way to understand what we were saying last time that the trajectory at that point has a vertical tendency because that's the direction in which the motion is going to occur just before and just after time <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232998,"text":"OK, any questions about that?OK, so I should insist maybe on one thing, which is that, so, we can differentiate vectors just component by component, OK, and we can differentiate vector expressions according to certain rules that we'll see in a moment.","entities":[{"id":93201,"label":"command","start_offset":98,"end_offset":111},{"id":93202,"label":"command","start_offset":164,"end_offset":177}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":232999,"text":"One thing that we cannot do, it's not true that the length of dr dt, which is the speed, = the length of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233000,"text":"OK, this is completely false.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233001,"text":"And, they are really not the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233002,"text":"So, if you have to differentiate the length of a vector, but basically you are in trouble.","entities":[{"id":93203,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233003,"text":"If you really, really want to do it, well, the length of the vector is the square root of the sums of the squares of the components, and from that you can use the formula for the derivative of the square root, and the chain rule, and various other things.","entities":[{"id":93204,"label":"method","start_offset":75,"end_offset":86},{"id":93205,"label":"command","start_offset":155,"end_offset":158},{"id":93206,"label":"method","start_offset":179,"end_offset":189},{"id":93207,"label":"method","start_offset":197,"end_offset":208},{"id":93208,"label":"method","start_offset":218,"end_offset":228}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233004,"text":"And, you can get there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233005,"text":"But, it will not be a very nice expression.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233006,"text":"There is no simple formula for this kind of thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233007,"text":"Fortunately, we almost never have to compute this kind of thing because, after all, it's not a very relevant quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233008,"text":"What's more relevant might be this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233009,"text":"This is actually the speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233010,"text":"This one, I don't know what it means.So, let's continue our exploration.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233012,"text":"So, arc length is just the distance that you have traveled along the curve, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233013,"text":"So, if you are in a car, you know, it has mileage counter that tells you how far you've gone, how much fuel you've used if it's a fancy car.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233014,"text":"And, what it does is it actually integrates the speed of the time to give you the arc length along the trajectory of the car.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233015,"text":"So, the usual notation that we will have is <EXPRESSION> for arc length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233016,"text":"I'm not quite sure how you get an <EXPRESSION> out of this, but it's the usual notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233017,"text":"OK, so, <EXPRESSION> is for distance traveled along the trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233018,"text":"And, so that makes sense, of course, we need to fix a reference point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233019,"text":"Maybe on the cycloid, we'd say it's a distance starting on the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233021,"text":"But, it's a convention.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233022,"text":"If you knew in advance, you could have, actually, your car's mileage counter to count backwards from the point where the car will die and start walking.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233023,"text":"I mean, that would be sneaky-freaky, but you could have a negative arc length that gets closer and closer to <EXPRESSION>, and gets to <EXPRESSION> at the end of a trajectory, or anything you want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233024,"text":"I mean, arc length could be positive or negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233025,"text":"Typically it's negative what you are before the reference point, and positive afterwards.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233026,"text":"So, now, how does it relate to the things we've seen there?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233027,"text":"Well, so in particular, how do you relate arc length and time?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233028,"text":"Well, so, there's a simple relation, which is that the rate of change of arc length versus time, well, that's going to be the speed at which you are moving, OK, because the speed as a scalar quantity tells you how much distance you're covering per unit time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233029,"text":"OK, and in fact, to be completely honest, I should put an absolute value here because there is examples of curves maybe where your motion is going back and forth along the same curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233030,"text":"And then, you don't want to keep counting arc length all the time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233033,"text":"But, in this case, if you are moving back and forth, it would make more sense to have the arc length first increase, then decrease, increase again, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233034,"text":"So -- So if you want to know really what the arc length is, then basically the only way to do it is to integrate speed versus time.","entities":[{"id":93216,"label":"command","start_offset":103,"end_offset":112}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233035,"text":"So, if you wanted to know how long an arch of cycloid is, you have this nice-looking curve; how long is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233036,"text":"Well, you'd have to basically integrate this quantity from <EQUATION> to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93217,"label":"command","start_offset":30,"end_offset":39}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233037,"text":"And, to say the truth, I don't really know how to integrate that.","entities":[{"id":93219,"label":"command","start_offset":50,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233038,"text":"So, we don't actually have a formula for the length at this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233039,"text":"However, we'll see one later using a cool trick, and multi-variable calculus.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233040,"text":"So, for now, we'll just leave the formula like that, and we don't know how long it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233041,"text":"Well, you can put that into your calculator and get the numerical value.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233042,"text":"But, that's the best I can offer.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233043,"text":"Now, another useful notion is the unit vector to the trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233044,"text":"So, the usual notation is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233045,"text":"It has a hat because it's a unit vector, and <EXPRESSION> because it's tangent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233046,"text":"Now, how do we get this unit vector?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233048,"text":"It tells you the direction of motion in particular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233049,"text":"So, if you want a unit vector that goes in the same direction, all you have to do is rescale it, so, at its length becomes one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233050,"text":"So, it's <EXPRESSION> divided by a magnitude of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233051,"text":"So, it seems like now we have a lot of different things that should be related in some way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233052,"text":"So, let's see what we can say.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233053,"text":"Well, we can say that <EXPRESSION> by <EXPRESSION>, so, that's the velocity vector, that's the same thing as if I use the chain rule <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93224,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16},{"id":93225,"label":"command","start_offset":114,"end_offset":117},{"id":93226,"label":"method","start_offset":122,"end_offset":132}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233054,"text":"OK, so, let's think about this things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233055,"text":"So, this guy here we've just seen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233056,"text":"That's the same as the speed, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233057,"text":"So, this one here should be <EXPRESSION> divided by its length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233058,"text":"So, that means this actually should be the unit vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233059,"text":"OK, so, let me rewrite that.","entities":[{"id":93227,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233060,"text":"It's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233061,"text":"So, maybe if I actually stated directly that way, see, I'm just saying the velocity vector has a length and a direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233062,"text":"The length is the speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233063,"text":"The direction is tangent to the trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233064,"text":"So, the speed is <EXPRESSION>, and the vector is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233065,"text":"And, that's how we get this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233066,"text":"So, let's try just to see why <EXPRESSION> should be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233067,"text":"Well, let's think of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233068,"text":"<EXPRESSION> means position vector <EXPRESSION> means you have the origin, which is somewhere out there, and the vector <EXPRESSION> is here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233069,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> means we move by a small amount, <EXPRESSION> along the trajectory a certain distance <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233070,"text":"And, we look at how the position vector changes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233071,"text":"Well, we'll have a small change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233072,"text":"Let me call that vector <EXPRESSION> corresponding to the size, corresponding to the length <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233073,"text":"And now, <EXPRESSION> should be essentially roughly =, well, its direction will be tangent to the trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233075,"text":"OK, sorry, maybe I should explain that on a separate board.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233077,"text":"So, let's zoom into that curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233078,"text":"So, we have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233079,"text":"We have <EXPRESSION> at time <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233080,"text":"This vector here I will call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233081,"text":"The length of this vector is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233082,"text":"And, the direction is essentially that of a vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233083,"text":"OK, so, <EXPRESSION>, that's the distance traveled divided by the time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233084,"text":"That's going to be close to the speed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233085,"text":"And, <EXPRESSION> is approximately <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233086,"text":"So, now if I divide both sides by <EXPRESSION>, I get this.","entities":[{"id":93232,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":19},{"id":93233,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":20,"end_offset":30}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233088,"text":"It's an approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233089,"text":"The approximation becomes better and better if I go to smaller intervals.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233090,"text":"OK, are there any questions about this?Yes, that's correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233091,"text":"OK, so let's be more careful, actually.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233092,"text":"So, you're asking about whether the <EXPRESSION> is actually strictly tangent to the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233093,"text":"Is that -- That's correct.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233094,"text":"Actually, <EXPRESSION> is not strictly tangent to anything.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233095,"text":"So, maybe I should draw another picture.","entities":[{"id":93237,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233096,"text":"If I'm going from here to here, then <EXPRESSION> is going to be this arc inside the curve while the vector will be going in this direction, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233097,"text":"So, they are not strictly parallel to each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233098,"text":"That's why it's only approximately =.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233099,"text":"Similarly, this distance, the length of <EXPRESSION> is not exactly the length along the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233100,"text":"It's actually a bit shorter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233101,"text":"But, if we imagine a smaller and smaller portion of the curve, then this effect of the curve being a curve and not a straight line becomes more and more negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233102,"text":"If you zoom into the curve sufficiently, then it looks more and more like a straight line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233103,"text":"And then, what I said becomes true in the limit.Any other questions?OK.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233104,"text":"So, what happens next?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233106,"text":"And, we don't really need vectors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233107,"text":"Well, and truly, vectors being a language, you never strictly need it, but it's useful to have a notion of vectors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233108,"text":"So, I want to tell you a bit about Kepler's second law of celestial mechanics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233109,"text":"So, that goes back to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233110,"text":"So, that's not exactly recent news, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233112,"text":"So, what happened back then was Kepler was trying to observe the motion of planets in the sky, and trying to come up with general explanations of how they move.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233113,"text":"Before him, people were saying, well, they cannot move in a circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233114,"text":"But maybe it's more complicated than that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233115,"text":"We need to add smaller circular motions on top of each other, and so on.","entities":[{"id":93240,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233116,"text":"They have more and more complicated theories.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233117,"text":"And then Kepler came with these laws that said basically that planets move in an ellipse around the sun, and that they move in a very specific way along that ellipse.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233118,"text":"So, there's actually three laws, but let me just tell you about the second one that has a very nice vector interpretation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233119,"text":"So, what Kepler's second law says is that the motion of planets is, first of all, they move in a plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233120,"text":"And second, the area swept out by the line from the sun to the planet is swept at constant time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233121,"text":"Sorry, is swept at constant rate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233122,"text":"From the sun to the planet, it is swept out by the line at a constant rate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233123,"text":"OK, so that's an interesting law because it tells you, once you know what the orbit of the planet looks like, it tells you how fast it's going to move on that orbit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233124,"text":"OK, so let me explain again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233125,"text":"So, this law says maybe the sun, let's put the sun here at the origin, and let's have a planet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233126,"text":"Well, the planet orbits around the sun -- -- in some trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233127,"text":"So, this is supposed to be light blue.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233128,"text":"Can you see that it's different from white?OK, me neither.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233129,"text":"OK, it doesn't really matter.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233130,"text":"So, the planet moves on its orbit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233131,"text":"And, if you wait for a certain time, then a bit later it would be here, and then here, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233132,"text":"Then, you can look at the amount of area inside this triangular wedge.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233133,"text":"And, the claim is that the amount of area in here is proportional to the time elapsed.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233134,"text":"So, in particular, if a planet is closer to the sun, then it has to go faster.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233135,"text":"And, if it's farther away from the sun, then it has to go slower so that the area remains proportional to time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233136,"text":"So, it's a very sophisticated prediction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233137,"text":"And, I think the way he came to it was really just by using a lot of observations, and trying to measure what was true that wasn't true.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233138,"text":"But, let's try to see how we can understand that in terms of all we know today about mechanics.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233139,"text":"So, in fact, what happens is that Newton, so Newton was quite a bit later.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233140,"text":"That was the late 17th century instead of the beginning of the 17th century.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233141,"text":"So, he was able to explain this using his laws for gravitational attraction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233142,"text":"And, you'll see that if we reformulate Kepler's Law in terms of vectors, and if we work a bit with these vectors, we are going to end up with something that's actually completely obvious to us now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233143,"text":"At the time, it was very far from obvious, but to us now to completely obvious.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233145,"text":"OK, so, let's think of what kinds of vectors we might want to have in here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233146,"text":"Well, it might be good to think of, maybe, the position vector, and maybe its variation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233147,"text":"So, if we wait a certain amount of time, we'll have a vector, <EXPRESSION>, which is the change in position vector a various interval of time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233148,"text":"OK, so let's start with the first step.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233149,"text":"What's the most complicated thing in here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233150,"text":"It's this area swept out by the line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233151,"text":"How do we express that area in terms of vectors?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233152,"text":"Well, I've almost given the answer by drawing this picture, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233154,"text":"So, we have to find the area of the triangle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233155,"text":"Well, we know how to do that now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233156,"text":"So, the area is approximately = one half of the area of a parallelogram that I could form from these vectors.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233157,"text":"And, the area of a parallelogram is given by the magnitude of a cross product.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233159,"text":"You should think of <EXPRESSION> as relatively small.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233160,"text":"I mean, the scale of a planet that might still be a few days, but small compared to the other old trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233161,"text":"So, let's remember that the amount by which we moved, <EXPRESSION>, is approximately = <EXPRESSION>, OK, and just using the definition of a velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233163,"text":"Sorry, so it's approximately = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233166,"text":"It means this thing is proportional to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233167,"text":"So, that means, so, the law says, in fact, that the length of this cross product <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233168,"text":"OK, <EXPRESSION> has constant length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233169,"text":"Any questions about that?Yes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233170,"text":"Yes, let me try to explain that again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233171,"text":"So, what I'm claiming is that the length of the cross products <EXPRESSION> measures the rate at which area is swept by the position vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233173,"text":"How do we see that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233175,"text":"In time, <EXPRESSION>, our planet moves by <EXPRESSION>, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233176,"text":"So, if it moves by <EXPRESSION>, it means that this triangle up there has two sides.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233177,"text":"One is the position vector, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233178,"text":"The other one is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233179,"text":"So, its area is given by one half of the magnitude of a cross product.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233183,"text":"Area divided by <EXPRESSION> is constant at our time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233184,"text":"And so, this is constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233185,"text":"OK, now, what about the other half of the law?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233186,"text":"Well, it says that the motion is in a plane, and so we have a plane in which the motion takes place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233187,"text":"And, it contains, also, the sun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233188,"text":"And, it contains the trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233189,"text":"So, let's think about that plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233190,"text":"Well, I claim that the position vector is in the plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233191,"text":"OK, that's what we are saying.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233192,"text":"But, there is another vector that I know it is in the plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233194,"text":"OK, if I'm moving in the plane, then position and velocity are in there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233195,"text":"So, the plane of motion contains <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233196,"text":"So, what's the direction of the cross product <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233197,"text":"Well, it's the direction that's perpendicular to this plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233198,"text":"So, it's normal to the plane of motion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233199,"text":"And, that means, now, that actually we've put the two statements in there into a single form because we are saying <EXPRESSION> has constant length and constant direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233200,"text":"In fact, in general, maybe I should say something about this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233201,"text":"So, if you just look at the position vector, and the velocity vector for any motion at any given time, then together, they determine some plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233202,"text":"And, that's the plane that contains the origin, the point, and the velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233203,"text":"If you want, it's the plane in which the motion seems to be going at the given time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233204,"text":"Now, of course, if your motion is not in a plane, then that plane will change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233205,"text":"It's, however, instant, if a plane in which the motion is taking place at a given time.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233206,"text":"And, to say that the motion actually stays in that plane forever means that this guy will not change direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233207,"text":"OK, so --OK, so, Kepler's second law is actually equivalent to saying that <EQUATION>, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233208,"text":"That's what the law says.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233209,"text":"So, in terms of derivatives, it means <EXPRESSION> is the <EXPRESSION> vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233210,"text":"OK, now, so there's an interesting thing to note, which is that we can use the usual product rule for derivatives with vector expressions, with dot products or cross products.","entities":[{"id":93253,"label":"command","start_offset":71,"end_offset":74},{"id":93254,"label":"method","start_offset":85,"end_offset":97}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233211,"text":"There's only one catch, which is that when we differentiate a cross product, we have to be careful that the guy on the left stays on the left.","entities":[{"id":93255,"label":"command","start_offset":46,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233213,"text":"OK, so, if you know that <EXPRESSION>, then you are safe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233214,"text":"If you know it as <EXPRESSION>, then you are not safe.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233215,"text":"OK, so it's the only thing to watch for.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233216,"text":"So, product rule is OK for taking the derivative of a dot product.","entities":[{"id":93260,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":16},{"id":93261,"label":"method","start_offset":38,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233217,"text":"There, you don't actually even need to be very careful about all the things or the derivative of a cross product.","entities":[{"id":93262,"label":"method","start_offset":83,"end_offset":93}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233218,"text":"There you just need to be a little bit more careful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233219,"text":"OK, so, now that we know that, we can write this as <EXPRESSION>, OK?","entities":[{"id":93263,"label":"command","start_offset":38,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233220,"text":"Well, let's reformulate things slightly.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233221,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> already has a name.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233222,"text":"In fact, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233223,"text":"OK, that's what we call the velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233224,"text":"So, this is <EXPRESSION>, what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233225,"text":"That's the acceleration, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233226,"text":"OK, so now what's the next step?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233227,"text":"Well, we know what <EXPRESSION> is because, remember, a vector cross itself is always <EXPRESSION>, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233228,"text":"So, this is the same <EQUATION>, and that's the same as saying that the cross product of two vectors is <EXPRESSION> exactly when the parallelogram of the form has no area.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233229,"text":"And, the way in which that happens is if they are actually parallel to each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233230,"text":"So, that means the acceleration is parallel to the position.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233231,"text":"OK, so, in fact, what Kepler's second law says is that the acceleration is parallel to the position vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233232,"text":"And, since we know that acceleration is caused by a force that's equivalent to the fact that the gravitational force -- -- is parallel to the position vector, that means, well, if you have the sun here at the origin, and if you have your planets, well, the gravitational force caused by the sun should go along this line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233233,"text":"In fact, the law doesn't even say whether it's going towards the sun or away from the sun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233234,"text":"Well, what we know now is that, of course, the attraction is towards the sun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233235,"text":"But, Kepler's law would also be true, actually, if things were going away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233236,"text":"So, in particular, say, electric force also has this property of being towards the central charge.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233237,"text":"So, actually, if you look at motion of charged particles in an electric field caused by a point charged particle, it also satisfies Kepler's law, satisfies the same law.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233238,"text":"OK, that's the end for today, thanks.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233241,"text":"And, this causes a function to change accordingly using, well, the partial derivatives tell you how sensitive <EXPRESSION> is to changes in each variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233242,"text":"OK, so, we are going to just rewrite this in a new notation.","entities":[{"id":93267,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233243,"text":"So, I'm going to rewrite this in a more concise form as gradient of <EXPRESSION> dot product with velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93268,"label":"command","start_offset":17,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233244,"text":"So, the gradient of <EXPRESSION> is a vector formed by putting together all of the partial derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233245,"text":"OK, so it's the vector whose components are the partials.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233246,"text":"And, of course, it's a vector that depends on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233247,"text":"These guys depend on <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233248,"text":"So, it's actually one vector for each point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233249,"text":"You can talk about the gradient of <EXPRESSION> at some point, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233250,"text":"So, at each point, it gives you a vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233251,"text":"That actually is what we will call later a vector field.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233252,"text":"We'll get back to that later.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233254,"text":"OK, so the new definition for today is the definition of the gradient vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233255,"text":"And, our goal will be to understand a bit better, what does this vector mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233256,"text":"What does it measure?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233257,"text":"And, what can we do with it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233258,"text":"But, you see that in terms of information content, it's really the same information that's already in the partial derivatives, or in the differential.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233260,"text":"And so far, it's just notation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233261,"text":"It's a way to rewrite things.","entities":[{"id":93272,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233262,"text":"But, so here's the first cool property of the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233263,"text":"So, I claim that the gradient vector is perpendicular to the level surface corresponding to setting the function, <EXPRESSION>, = a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233264,"text":"OK, so if I draw a contour plot of my function, so, actually forget about <EXPRESSION> because I want to draw a two variable contour plot.","entities":[{"id":93273,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16},{"id":93275,"label":"command","start_offset":105,"end_offset":109}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233265,"text":"So, say I have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, then maybe it has some contour plot.","entities":[{"id":93277,"label":"command","start_offset":4,"end_offset":7}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233267,"text":"So, I will have a vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233268,"text":"Well, if I draw that vector on top of a contour plot, it's going to end up being perpendicular to the level curve.","entities":[{"id":93280,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":15}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233269,"text":"Same thing if I have a function of three variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233270,"text":"Then, I can try to draw its contour plot.","entities":[{"id":93282,"label":"command","start_offset":19,"end_offset":23}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233271,"text":"Of course, I can't really do it because the contour plot would be living in space with <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233272,"text":"But, it would be a bunch of level faces, and the gradient vector would be a vector in space.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233273,"text":"That vector is perpendicular to the level faces.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233274,"text":"So, let's try to see that on a couple of examples.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233275,"text":"So, let's do a first example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233276,"text":"What's the easiest case?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233279,"text":"Well, so, what's the gradient of this function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233280,"text":"Well, the first component will be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233281,"text":"That's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233282,"text":"Then, <EXPRESSION>, that's partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233283,"text":"Now, what is the levels of this?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233284,"text":"Well, if I set <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>, that means I look at the points where <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":93287,"label":"command","start_offset":11,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233285,"text":"What kind of service is that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233286,"text":"It's a plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233287,"text":"And, we know how to find a normal vector to this plane just by looking at the coefficients.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233288,"text":"So, it's a plane with a normal vector exactly this gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233289,"text":"And, in fact, in a way, this is the only case you need to check because of linear approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233290,"text":"If you replace a function by its linear approximation, that means you will replace the level surfaces by their tension planes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233291,"text":"And then, you'll actually end up in this situation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233292,"text":"But maybe that's not very convincing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233293,"text":"So, let's do another example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233294,"text":"So, let's do a second example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233295,"text":"Let's say we look at the function <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93288,"label":"command","start_offset":6,"end_offset":9}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233296,"text":"OK, so now it's a function of just two variables because that way we'll be able to actually draw a picture for you.","entities":[{"id":93289,"label":"command","start_offset":92,"end_offset":96}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233297,"text":"OK, so what are the level sets of this function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233298,"text":"Well, they're going to be circles, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233299,"text":"<EQUATION> is a circle, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233301,"text":"So, the contour plot looks something like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233302,"text":"Now, what's the gradient vector?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233303,"text":"Well, the gradient of this function, so, partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233304,"text":"And partial <EXPRESSION> partial <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233306,"text":"So, here at <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, so, I have to draw the vector, &<EXPRESSION>;<EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>&<EXPRESSION>;.","entities":[{"id":93295,"label":"command","start_offset":54,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233307,"text":"What does it look like?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233308,"text":"Well, it's going in that direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233309,"text":"It's parallel to the position vector for this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233310,"text":"It's actually twice the position vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233311,"text":"So, I guess it goes more or less like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233312,"text":"What's interesting, too, is it is perpendicular to this circle.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233313,"text":"OK, so it's a general feature.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233314,"text":"Actually, let me show you more examples, oops, not the one I want.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233315,"text":"So, I don't know if you can see it so well.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233316,"text":"Well, hopefully you can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233317,"text":"So, here I have a contour plot of a function, and I have a blue vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233319,"text":"So, you can see, I can move the pink point, and the gradient vector, of course, changes because the gradient depends on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233320,"text":"But, what doesn't change is that it's always perpendicular to the level curves.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233321,"text":"Anywhere I am, my gradient stays perpendicular to the level curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233322,"text":"OK, is that convincing?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233323,"text":"Is that visible for people who can't see blue?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233324,"text":"OK, so, OK, so we have a lot of evidence, but let's try to prove the theorem because it will be interesting.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233325,"text":"So, first of all, sorry, any questions about the statement, the example, anything, yes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233326,"text":"Ah, very good question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233327,"text":"Does the gradient vector, why is the gradient vector perpendicular in one direction rather than the other?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233328,"text":"So, we'll see the answer to that in a few minutes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233329,"text":"But let me just tell you immediately, to the side, which side it's pointing to, it's always pointing towards higher values of a function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233330,"text":"OK, and we'll see in that maybe about half an hour.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233331,"text":"So, well, let me say actually points towards higher values of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233332,"text":"OK, any other questions?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233333,"text":"I don't see any questions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233334,"text":"OK, so let's try to prove this theorem, at least this part of the theorem.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233335,"text":"We're not going to prove that just yet.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233336,"text":"That will come in a while.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233337,"text":"So, well, maybe we want to understand first what happens if we move inside the level curve, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233338,"text":"So, let's imagine that we are taking a moving point that stays on the level curve or on the level surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233339,"text":"And then, we know, well, what happens is that the function stays constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233340,"text":"But, we can also know how quickly the function changes using the chain rule up there.","entities":[{"id":93300,"label":"method","start_offset":65,"end_offset":75}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233341,"text":"So, maybe the chain rule will actually be the key to understanding how the gradient vector and the motion on the level service relate.","entities":[{"id":93301,"label":"method","start_offset":14,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233343,"text":"So, let's think about what that means.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233345,"text":"OK, so it's a surface given by the equation <EXPRESSION> = some constant, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233346,"text":"And, so now I'm going to have a point on that, and it's going to move on that surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233347,"text":"So, I will have some parametric curve that lives on this surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233348,"text":"So, the question is, what's going to happen at any given time?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233349,"text":"Well, the first observation is that the velocity vector, what can I say about the velocity vector of this motion?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233350,"text":"It's going to be tangent to the level surface, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233351,"text":"If I move on a surface, then at any point, my velocity is tangent to the curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233352,"text":"But, if it's tangent to the curve, then it's also tangent to the surface because the curve is inside the surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233353,"text":"So, OK, it's getting a bit cluttered.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233354,"text":"Maybe I should draw a bigger picture.","entities":[{"id":93307,"label":"command","start_offset":15,"end_offset":19}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233355,"text":"Let me do that right away here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233356,"text":"So, I have my level surface, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233357,"text":"I have a curve on that, and at some point, I'm going to have a certain velocity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233358,"text":"So, the claim is that the velocity, <EXPRESSION>, = <EXPRESSION> is tangent -- -- to the level, <EQUATION> because it's tangent to the curve, and the curve is inside the level, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233359,"text":"Now, what else can we say?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233360,"text":"Well, we have, the chain rule will tell us how the value of <EXPRESSION> changes.","entities":[{"id":93310,"label":"method","start_offset":19,"end_offset":29}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233361,"text":"So, by the chain rule, we have <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93311,"label":"method","start_offset":11,"end_offset":21}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233362,"text":"So, the rate of change of the value of <EXPRESSION> as I move along this curve is given by the dot product between the gradient and the velocity vector.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233363,"text":"And, so, well, maybe I can rewrite it as <EXPRESSION>, and that should be, well, what should it be?","entities":[{"id":93312,"label":"command","start_offset":27,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233364,"text":"What happens to the value of <EXPRESSION> as <EXPRESSION> changes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233365,"text":"Well, it stays constant because we are moving on a curve.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233366,"text":"That curve might be complicated, but it stays always on the level, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233367,"text":"So, it's <EXPRESSION> because <EQUATION>, which is a constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233368,"text":"OK, is that convincing?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233369,"text":"OK, so now if we have a dot product that's <EXPRESSION>, that tells us that these two guys are perpendicular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233370,"text":"So -- So if the gradient vector is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>, OK, that's a good start.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233371,"text":"We know that the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent that's tangent to the level surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233372,"text":"What about other vectors tangent to the level surface?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233373,"text":"Well, in fact, I could use any curve drawn on the level of <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233374,"text":"So, I could move, really, any way I wanted on that surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233375,"text":"In particular, I claim that I could have chosen my velocity vector to be any vector tangent to the surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233376,"text":"OK, so let's write this.","entities":[{"id":93314,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233377,"text":"So this is true for any curve, or, I'll say for any motion on the level surface, <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":93315,"label":"command","start_offset":40,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233378,"text":"So that means <EXPRESSION> can be any vector tangent to the surface tangent to the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233379,"text":"See, for example, OK, let me draw one more picture.","entities":[{"id":93316,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233380,"text":"OK, so I have my level surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233381,"text":"So, I'm drawing more and more levels, and they never quite look the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233382,"text":"But I have a point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233383,"text":"And, at this point, I have the tangent plane to the level surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233384,"text":"OK, so this is tangent plane to the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233385,"text":"Then, if I choose any vector in that tangent plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233387,"text":"Then, I can actually find a curve that goes in that direction, and stays on the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233389,"text":"OK, so given any vector tangent -- -- let's call that vector <EXPRESSION> tangent to the level, we get that the gradient is perpendicular to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233390,"text":"So, if the gradient is perpendicular to this vector tangent to this curve, but also to any vector, I can draw that tangent to my surface.","entities":[{"id":93321,"label":"command","start_offset":105,"end_offset":109}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233391,"text":"So, what does that mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233392,"text":"Well, that means the gradient is actually perpendicular to the tangent plane or to the surface at this point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233393,"text":"So, the gradient is perpendicular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233394,"text":"And, well, here, I've illustrated things with a three-dimensional example, but really it works the same if you have only two variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233395,"text":"Then you have a level curve that has a tangent line, and the gradient is perpendicular to that line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233396,"text":"OK, any questions?OK, so, let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233397,"text":"That's actually pretty neat because there is a nice application of this, which is to try to figure out, now we know, actually, how to find the tangent plane to anything, pretty much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233398,"text":"OK, so let's see.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233400,"text":"Let me write that.","entities":[{"id":93324,"label":"command","start_offset":7,"end_offset":12}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233401,"text":"So, how do we do that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233403,"text":"But, that doesn't look like it's the best way to do it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233404,"text":"OK, the best way to it, now that we have the gradient vector, is actually to directly say, oh, we know the normal vector to this plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233405,"text":"The normal vector will just be the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233406,"text":"Oh, I think I have a cool picture to show.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233407,"text":"OK, so that's what it looks like.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233408,"text":"OK, so here you have the surface <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233409,"text":"That's called a hyperboloid because it looks like when you get when you spin a hyperbola around an axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233410,"text":"And, here's a tangent plane at the given point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233411,"text":"So, it doesn't look very tangent because it crosses the surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233412,"text":"But, it's really, if you think about it, you will see it's really the plane that's approximating the surface in the best way that you can at this given point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233413,"text":"It is really the tangent plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233414,"text":"So, how do we find this plane?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233415,"text":"Well, you can plot it on a computer.","entities":[{"id":93329,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233416,"text":"That's not exactly how you would look for it in the first place.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233417,"text":"So, the way to do it is that we compute the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233418,"text":"So, a gradient of what?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233419,"text":"Well, a gradient of this function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233420,"text":"OK, so I should say, this is the level set, <EQUATION>, where <EQUATION>.","entities":[{"id":93330,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":19},{"id":93331,"label":"command","start_offset":39,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233421,"text":"And so, we know that the gradient of this, well, what is it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233422,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, then <EXPRESSION>, and then <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233423,"text":"So, at this given point, I guess we are at <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233424,"text":"So, that's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233425,"text":"And then, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233426,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233427,"text":"OK, and that's going to be the normal vector to the surface or to the tangent plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233428,"text":"That's one way to define the tangent plane.","entities":[{"id":93332,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233429,"text":"All right, it has the same normal vector as the surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233430,"text":"That's one way to define the normal vector to the surface, if you prefer.","entities":[{"id":93333,"label":"command","start_offset":18,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233431,"text":"Being perpendicular to the surface means that you are perpendicular to its tangent plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233432,"text":"OK, so the equation is, well, <EXPRESSION> = something, where something is, well, we should just plug in that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233433,"text":"We'll get <EXPRESSION> looks like we'll get <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233434,"text":"And, of course, we could simplify dividing everything by two, but it's not very important here.","entities":[{"id":93336,"label":"command","start_offset":25,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233435,"text":"OK, so now if you have a surface given by an evil equation, and a point on the surface, well, you know how to find the tangent plane to the surface at that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233436,"text":"OK, any questions?OK, let me give just another reason why, another way that we could have seen this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233437,"text":"So, I claim, in fact, we could have done this without the gradient, or using the gradient in a somehow disguised way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233438,"text":"So, here's another way.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233439,"text":"So, the other way to do it would be to start with a differential, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233440,"text":"<EXPRESSION>, while it's pretty much the same content, but let me write it as a differential, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93337,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233442,"text":"Now, if we want to change this into an approximation formula, we can.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233443,"text":"We know that the change in <EXPRESSION> is approximately = <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233444,"text":"OK, so when do we stay on the level surface?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233445,"text":"Well, we stay on the level surface when <EXPRESSION> doesn't change, so, when this becomes <EXPRESSION>, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233446,"text":"Now, what does this approximation sign mean?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233447,"text":"Well, it means for small changes in <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, this guy will be close to that guy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233448,"text":"It also means something else.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233449,"text":"Remember, these approximation formulas, they are linear approximations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233450,"text":"They mean that we replace the function, actually, by some closest linear formula that will be nearby.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233451,"text":"And so, in particular, if we set this = <EXPRESSION> instead of approximately <EXPRESSION>, it means we'll actually be moving on the tangent plane to the level set.","entities":[{"id":93338,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233452,"text":"If you want strict equalities in approximations means that we replace the function by its tangent approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233453,"text":"So --OK, so the level corresponds to <EQUATION> and its tangent plane corresponds to <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233454,"text":"That's what I'm trying to say, basically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233455,"text":"And, what's <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233456,"text":"Well, that means it's the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233457,"text":"So, what's the change in <EXPRESSION> here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233458,"text":"That means, well, we started with <EQUATION>, and we moved to some other value, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233459,"text":"So, that's actually <EXPRESSION>, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233460,"text":"That's how much <EXPRESSION> has changed compared to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233461,"text":"And, <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233462,"text":"That's the equation of a tangent plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233463,"text":"It's the same equation as the one over there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233464,"text":"These are just two different methods to get it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233465,"text":"OK, so this one explains to you what's going on in terms of approximation formulas.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233466,"text":"This one goes right away, by using the gradient factor.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233467,"text":"So, in a way, with this one, you don't have to think nearly as much.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233468,"text":"But, you can use either one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233469,"text":"OK, questions?OK, so let's move on to new topic, which is another application of a gradient vector, and that is directional derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233470,"text":"OK, so let's say that we have a function of two variables, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93344,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233471,"text":"Well, we know how to compute partial <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION>, which measure how <EXPRESSION> changes if I move in the direction of the x axis or in the direction of the y axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233472,"text":"So, what about moving in other directions?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233473,"text":"Well, of course, we've seen other approximation formulas and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233474,"text":"But, we can still ask, is there a derivative in every direction?","entities":[{"id":93345,"label":"method","start_offset":34,"end_offset":44}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233475,"text":"And that's basically, yes, that's the directional derivative.","entities":[{"id":93346,"label":"method","start_offset":50,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233476,"text":"OK, so these are derivatives in the direction of I hat or j hat, the vectors that go along the x or the y axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233478,"text":"OK, so if I give you a unit vector, you can ask yourself, if I move in the direction, how quickly will my function change?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233479,"text":"So -- So, let's look at the straight trajectory.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233480,"text":"What this should mean is I start at some value, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and there I have my vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233481,"text":"And, I'm going to move in a straight line in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233483,"text":"OK, so let's look at a straight line trajectory So, we have a position vector, <EXPRESSION>, that will depend on some parameter which I will call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233484,"text":"You'll see why very soon, in such a way that the derivative is this given unit vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93350,"label":"method","start_offset":49,"end_offset":59}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233486,"text":"Well, it's a convention.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233487,"text":"I'm moving at unit speed along this line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233488,"text":"So that means that actually, I'm parameterizing things by the distance that I've traveled along a curve, sorry, along this line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233489,"text":"So, here it's called s in the sense of arc length.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233490,"text":"Actually, it's not really an arc because it's a straight line, so it's the distance along the line.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233491,"text":"OK, so because we are parameterizing by distance, we are just using s as a convention just to distinguish it from other situations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233492,"text":"And, so, now, the question will be, what is <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233493,"text":"What's the rate of change of w when I move like that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233494,"text":"Well, of course we know the answer because that's a special case of the chain rule.","entities":[{"id":93352,"label":"method","start_offset":72,"end_offset":82}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233495,"text":"So, that's how we will actually compute it.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233496,"text":"But, in terms of what it means, it really means we are asking ourselves, we start at a point and we change the variables in a certain direction, which is not necessarily the x or the y direction, but really any direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233497,"text":"And then, what's the derivative in that direction?","entities":[{"id":93353,"label":"method","start_offset":21,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233498,"text":"OK, does that make sense as a concept?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233499,"text":"Kind of?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233500,"text":"I see some faces that are not completely convinced.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233501,"text":"So, maybe you should show more pictures.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233503,"text":"So I just want to give you the actual definition.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233507,"text":"And then, we plug that into <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233508,"text":"And then we take the derivative.","entities":[{"id":93358,"label":"command","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16},{"id":93359,"label":"method","start_offset":21,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233509,"text":"So, we have a notation for that which is going to be <EXPRESSION> with a subscript in the direction of u to indicate in which direction we are actually going to move.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233510,"text":"And, that's called the directional derivative -- -- in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93360,"label":"method","start_offset":35,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233511,"text":"OK, so, let's see what it means geometrically.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233512,"text":"So, remember, we've seen things about partial derivatives, and we see that the partial derivatives are the slopes of slices of the graph by vertical planes that are parallel to the x or the y directions.","entities":[{"id":93361,"label":"command","start_offset":131,"end_offset":136}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233513,"text":"OK, so, if I have a point, at any point, I can slice the graph of my function by two planes, one that's going along the x, one along the y direction.","entities":[{"id":93362,"label":"command","start_offset":57,"end_offset":62}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233514,"text":"And then, I can look at the slices of the graph.","entities":[{"id":93363,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":47}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233515,"text":"Let me see if I can use that thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233517,"text":"In fact, we look at the tangent lines to the slices, and we look at the slope and that gives us the partial derivatives in case you are on that side and want to see also the pointer that was here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233519,"text":"It's not really colorful, something more colorful.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233521,"text":"So, what that looks like here, so that's the same applet the way that you've used on your problem set in case you are wondering.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233522,"text":"So, now, I'm picking a point on the contour plot.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233523,"text":"And, at that point, I slice the graph.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233524,"text":"So, here I'm starting by slicing in the direction of the x axis.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233525,"text":"So, in fact, what I'm measuring here by the slope of the slice is the partial in the x direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233526,"text":"It's really <EXPRESSION>, which is also the directional derivative in the direction of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93372,"label":"method","start_offset":56,"end_offset":66}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233527,"text":"And now, if I rotate the slice, then I have all of these planes.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233528,"text":"So, you see at the bottom left, I have the direction in which I'm going.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233529,"text":"There's this, like, rotating line that tells you in which direction I'm going to be moving.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233530,"text":"And for each direction, I have a plane.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233531,"text":"And, when I slice by that plane, I will get, so I have this direction here going maybe to the southwest.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233533,"text":"And, the slope is going to be the directional derivative in that direction.","entities":[{"id":93376,"label":"method","start_offset":46,"end_offset":56}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233534,"text":"OK, I think that's as graphic as I can get.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233535,"text":"OK, any questions about that?OK, so let's see how we compute that guy.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233536,"text":"So, let me just write again just in case you want to, in case you didn't hear me it's the slope of the slice of the graph by a vertical plane -- -- that contains the given direction, that's parallel to the direction, u.","entities":[{"id":93378,"label":"command","start_offset":16,"end_offset":21},{"id":93379,"label":"command","start_offset":116,"end_offset":121}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233537,"text":"So, how do we compute it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233538,"text":"Well, we can use the chain rule.","entities":[{"id":93380,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":16},{"id":93381,"label":"method","start_offset":21,"end_offset":31}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233539,"text":"The chain rule implies that <EXPRESSION> is actually the gradient of w dot product with the velocity vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93382,"label":"method","start_offset":4,"end_offset":14}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233541,"text":"So, in fact, that's just gradient <EXPRESSION> dot product with the unit vector <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233542,"text":"OK, so the formula that we remember is really <EXPRESSION> in the direction of u is gradient <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233543,"text":"And, maybe I should also say in words, this is the component of the gradient in the direction of u.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233544,"text":"And, maybe that makes more sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233545,"text":"So, for example, the directional derivative in the direction of I hat is the component along the x axes.","entities":[{"id":93385,"label":"method","start_offset":33,"end_offset":43}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233546,"text":"That's the same as, indeed, the partial derivatives in the x direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233547,"text":"Things make sense.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233548,"text":"dw\/ds in the direction of I hat is, sorry, gradient <EXPRESSION>, which is <EXPRESSION>, maybe I should write, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93386,"label":"command","start_offset":104,"end_offset":109}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233549,"text":"OK, now, so that's basically what we need to know to compute these guys.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233550,"text":"So now, let's go back to the gradient and see what this tells us about the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233551,"text":"I see you guys are having fun.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233552,"text":"OK, OK, let's do a little bit of geometry here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233553,"text":"That should calm you down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233554,"text":"So, we said <EXPRESSION> in the direction of <EXPRESSION> is gradient <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233555,"text":"That's the same as the length of gradient <EXPRESSION> times the length of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93387,"label":"command","start_offset":55,"end_offset":60}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233556,"text":"Well, that happens to be one because we are taking the unit vector times the cosine of the angle between the gradient and the given unit vector, <EXPRESSION>, so, have this angle, theta.","entities":[{"id":93388,"label":"command","start_offset":67,"end_offset":72}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233557,"text":"OK, that's another way of saying we are taking the component of a gradient in the direction of u.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233558,"text":"But now, what does that tell us?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233559,"text":"Well, let's try to figure out in which directions w changes the fastest, in which direction it increases the most or decreases the most, or doesn't actually change.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233560,"text":"So, when is this going to be the largest?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233562,"text":"But, the question is, in which direction does it change the most quickly?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233563,"text":"Well, what I can change is the direction, and this will be the largest when the cosine is one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233564,"text":"So, this is largest when the <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233565,"text":"That means the angle is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233566,"text":"That means u is actually in the direction of the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233567,"text":"OK, so that's a new way to think about the direction of a gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233568,"text":"The gradient is the direction in which the function increases the most quickly at that point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233569,"text":"So, the direction of gradient <EXPRESSION> is the direction of fastest increase of <EXPRESSION> at the given point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233570,"text":"And, what is the magnitude of <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233571,"text":"Well, it's actually the directional derivative in that direction.","entities":[{"id":93390,"label":"method","start_offset":36,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233572,"text":"OK, so if I go in that direction, which gives me the fastest increase, then the corresponding slope will be the length of the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233573,"text":"And, with the direction of the fastest decrease?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233574,"text":"It's going in the opposite direction, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233575,"text":"I mean, if you are on a mountain, and you know that you are facing the mountain, that's the direction of fastest increase.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233576,"text":"The direction of fastest decrease is behind you straight down.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233577,"text":"OK, so, the minimal value of <EXPRESSION> is achieved when <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233578,"text":"That means <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233579,"text":"That means <EXPRESSION> is in the direction of minus the gradient.","entities":[{"id":93391,"label":"command","start_offset":47,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233580,"text":"It points opposite to the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233581,"text":"And, finally, when do we have <EQUATION>?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233582,"text":"So, in which direction does the function not change?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233583,"text":"Well, we have two answers to that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233585,"text":"So, that's <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233586,"text":"That means <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233587,"text":"That means that <EXPRESSION> is perpendicular to the gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233588,"text":"The other way to think about it, the direction in which the value doesn't change is a direction that's tangent to the level surface.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233589,"text":"If we are not changing a, it means we are moving along the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233590,"text":"And, that's the same thing -- -- as being tangent to the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233591,"text":"So, let me just show that on the picture here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233592,"text":"So, if actually show you the gradient, you can't really see it here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233593,"text":"I need to move it a bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233594,"text":"So, the gradient here is pointing straight up at the point that I have chosen.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233595,"text":"Now, if I choose a slice that's perpendicular, and a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient, so that's actually tangent to the level curve, then you see that my slice is flat.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233596,"text":"I don't actually have any slop.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233597,"text":"The directional derivative in a direction that's perpendicular to the gradient is basically <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93393,"label":"method","start_offset":16,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233598,"text":"Now, if I rotate, then the slope sort of increases, increases, increases, and it becomes the largest when I'm going in the direction of a gradient.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233599,"text":"So, here, I have, actually, a pretty big slope.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233600,"text":"And now, if I keep rotating, then the slope will decrease again.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233601,"text":"Then it becomes <EXPRESSION> when I perpendicular, and then it becomes negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233602,"text":"It's the most negative when I pointing away from the gradient and then becomes <EXPRESSION> again when I'm back perpendicular.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233603,"text":"OK, so for example, if I give you a contour plot, and I ask you to draw the direction of the gradient vector, well, at this point, for example, you would look at the picture.","entities":[{"id":93395,"label":"command","start_offset":67,"end_offset":71}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233604,"text":"The gradient vector would be going perpendicular to the level.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233605,"text":"And, it would be going towards higher values of a function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233606,"text":"I don't know if you can see the labels, but the thing in the middle is a minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233607,"text":"So, it will actually be pointing in this kind of direction.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233608,"text":"OK, so that's it for today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233609,"text":"So, today we are going to continue looking at critical points, and we'll learn how to actually decide whether a typical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233610,"text":"So, that's the main topic for today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233611,"text":"So, remember yesterday, we looked at critical points of functions of several variables.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233612,"text":"And, so a critical point functions, we have two values, <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233613,"text":"That's a point where the partial derivatives are both <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233614,"text":"And, we've seen that there's various kinds of critical points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233615,"text":"There's local minima.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233616,"text":"So, maybe I should show the function on this contour plot, there is local maxima, which are like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233617,"text":"And, there's saddle points which are neither minima nor maxima.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233618,"text":"And, of course, if you have a real function, then it would be more complicated.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233619,"text":"It will have several critical points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233621,"text":"And, there is in the middle, between them, a saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233622,"text":"And, actually, you can see them on the contour plot.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233623,"text":"On the contour plot, you see the maxima because the level curves become circles that now down and shrink to the maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233624,"text":"And, you can see the saddle point because here you have this level curve that makes a figure eight.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233625,"text":"It crosses itself.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233626,"text":"And, if you move up or down here, so along the y direction, the values of the function will decrease.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233627,"text":"Along the x direction, the values will increase.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233629,"text":"So, the only thing with the contour plots is you need to read the values to tell a minimum from a maximum because the contour plots look the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233630,"text":"Just, of course, in one case, the values increase, and in another one they decrease.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233631,"text":"So, the question -- -- is, how do we decide -- -- between the various possibilities?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233632,"text":"So, local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233633,"text":"So, and, in fact, why do we care?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233634,"text":"Well, the other question is how do we find the global minimum\/maximum of a function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233635,"text":"So, here what I should point out, well, first of all, to decide where the function is the largest, in general you'll have actually to compare the values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233636,"text":"For example, here, if you want to know, what is the maximum of this function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233637,"text":"Well, we have two obvious candidates.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233638,"text":"We have this local maximum and that local maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233639,"text":"And, the question is, which one is the higher of the two?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233640,"text":"Well, in this case, actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233641,"text":"But, in general, you would have to compute the function at both points, and compare the values if you know that it's three at one of them and four at the other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233642,"text":"Well, four wins.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233643,"text":"The other thing that you see here is if you are looking for the minimum of this function, well, the minimum is not going to be at any of the critical points.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233644,"text":"So, where's the minimum?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233645,"text":"Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out there on the boundary or at infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233646,"text":"So, that's another feature.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233647,"text":"The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be at a critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233648,"text":"It could also be, somehow, on the side in some limiting situation where one variable stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes to infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233649,"text":"So, we have to actually check the boundary and the infinity behavior of our function to know where, actually, the minimum and maximum will be.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233650,"text":"So, in general, I should point out, these should occur either at the critical point or on the boundary or at infinity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233651,"text":"So, by that, I mean on the boundary of a domain of definition that we are considering.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233652,"text":"And so, we have to try both.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233653,"text":"OK, but so we'll get back to that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233654,"text":"For now, let's try to focus on the question of, you know, what's the type of the critical point?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233655,"text":"So, we'll use something that's known as the second derivative test.","entities":[{"id":93402,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":13},{"id":93403,"label":"method","start_offset":51,"end_offset":61}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233656,"text":"And, in principle, well, the idea is kind of similar to what you do with the function of one variable, namely, the function of one variable.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233657,"text":"If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should look at the second derivative.","entities":[{"id":93404,"label":"method","start_offset":7,"end_offset":17},{"id":93405,"label":"method","start_offset":76,"end_offset":86}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233658,"text":"And, that will tell you whether it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the local min.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233659,"text":"And, the main problem here is, of course, we have more possible situations, and we have several derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233660,"text":"So, we have to think a bit harder about how we'll decide.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233661,"text":"But, it will again involve the second derivative.","entities":[{"id":93406,"label":"method","start_offset":38,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233662,"text":"OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful to us because actually it will provide the basis for the general method.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233663,"text":"OK, so we are first going to consider a case where we have a function that's actually just quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233664,"text":"So, let's say I have a function, <EXPRESSION> that's of the form <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93407,"label":"command","start_offset":10,"end_offset":13}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233665,"text":"OK, so this guy has a critical point at the origin because if you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, well, and if you plug <EQUATION>, you'll get <EXPRESSION>, and same with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93408,"label":"command","start_offset":66,"end_offset":70},{"id":93409,"label":"method","start_offset":75,"end_offset":85}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233666,"text":"You can also see, if you try to do a linear approximation of this, well, all these guys are much smaller than <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> when <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are small.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233668,"text":"OK, so, how do we do it?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233669,"text":"Well, yesterday we actually did an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233670,"text":"It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it, so remember, we were looking at something that started with <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233671,"text":"And, there were other terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233672,"text":"But, let's forget them now.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233673,"text":"And, what we did is we said, well, we can rewrite this as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93412,"label":"command","start_offset":42,"end_offset":49}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233674,"text":"And now, this is a sum of two squares.","entities":[{"id":93413,"label":"method","start_offset":19,"end_offset":22}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233675,"text":"So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233676,"text":"And so, the origin will be a minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233677,"text":"Well, it turns out we can do something similar in general no matter what the values of <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> are.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233679,"text":"OK, so let's do that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233733,"text":"What if <EXPRESSION> is negative?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233734,"text":"Well, if it's negative, then it means what I have between the brackets is, so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity, while the second one will be something negative times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93453,"label":"command","start_offset":174,"end_offset":179}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233735,"text":"So, it will be a negative quantity.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233737,"text":"The other is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233738,"text":"That tells us we actually have a saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233742,"text":"OK, so that's the first case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233743,"text":"The second case is where <EQUATION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233744,"text":"Well, what happens if that's zero?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233745,"text":"Then it means that this term over there goes away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233747,"text":"OK, so what that means is actually that our function depends only on one direction of things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233748,"text":"In the other direction, it's going to actually be degenerate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233765,"text":"We won't actually try to figure out further what happens, and the reason for that is that when you have an actual function, a general function, not just one that's quadratic like this, then there will actually be other terms maybe involving higher powers, maybe <EXPRESSION> or <EXPRESSION> or things like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233766,"text":"And then, they will mess up what happens in this valley.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233772,"text":"We just won't try to figure out what's going on here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233773,"text":"Now, the last situation is if <EXPRESSION> is positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233774,"text":"So, then, that means that actually we've written things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233775,"text":"The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.","entities":[{"id":93467,"label":"method","start_offset":30,"end_offset":33}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233779,"text":"How we find out which one it is?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233780,"text":"Well, we look at the sign of a, exactly.So, there's two sub-cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233781,"text":"One is if a is positive, then, this quantity overall will always be nonnegative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233784,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> is actually the maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233785,"text":"OK, is that clear for everyone?Sorry, yeah, so I said in the example <EQUATION>, it doesn't depend on <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233786,"text":"So, the more general situation is <EXPRESSION> = some constant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233787,"text":"Well, I guess it's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233788,"text":"So, it does depend on <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, but it only depends on this combination.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233789,"text":"OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular direction, in the direction where this remains constant, so maybe if I set <EQUATION>, then this remains zero all the time.","entities":[{"id":93472,"label":"command","start_offset":126,"end_offset":129}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233790,"text":"So, there's a degenerate direction in which I stay at the minimum or maximum, or whatever it is that I have.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233791,"text":"OK, so that's why it's called degenerate.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233792,"text":"There is a direction in which nothing happens.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233793,"text":"OK, yes?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233794,"text":"Yes, yeah, so that's a very good question.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233795,"text":"So, there's going to be the second derivative test.","entities":[{"id":93473,"label":"method","start_offset":35,"end_offset":45}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233796,"text":"Why do not have derivatives yet?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233797,"text":"Well, that's because I've been looking at this special example where we have a function like this.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233799,"text":"But, secretly, that's because <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION> will be the second derivatives of the function, actually, <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233800,"text":"So now, we are going to go to general function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233801,"text":"And there, instead of having these coefficients <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION>, and given to us, we'll have to compute them as second derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233803,"text":"But, in general, once you start having functions, you don't really know what will happen anymore.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233804,"text":"It could also be a degenerate saddle, and so on.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233805,"text":"So, we won't really be able to tell.It is possible to have a degenerate saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233807,"text":"If <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive, it's positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233808,"text":"And, it has a very degenerate critical point at the origin.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233809,"text":"So, that's a degenerate saddle point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233810,"text":"We don't see it here because that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233812,"text":"Before we continue, but see, I wanted to point out one small thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233813,"text":"So, here, we have the magic quantity, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233814,"text":"You've probably seen that before in your life.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233815,"text":"Yet, it looks like the quadratic formula, except that one involves <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233816,"text":"But that's really the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233817,"text":"OK, so let's see, where does the quadratic formula come in here?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233818,"text":"Well, let me write things differently.","entities":[{"id":93477,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233819,"text":"OK, so we've manipulated things, and got into a conclusion.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233820,"text":"But, let me just do a different manipulation, and write this now instead as <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93478,"label":"command","start_offset":50,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233821,"text":"OK, see, that's the same thing that I had before.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233822,"text":"Well, so now this quantity here is always nonnegative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233823,"text":"What about this one?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233824,"text":"Well, of course, this one depends on <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233825,"text":"It means it depends on which direction you're going to move away from the origin, which ratio between <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> you will consider.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233826,"text":"But, I claim there's two situations.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233827,"text":"One is, so, let's try to reformulate things.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233828,"text":"So, if a discriminate here is positive, then it means that these have roots and these have solutions.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233829,"text":"And, that means that this quantity can be both positive and negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233830,"text":"This quantity takes positive and negative values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233831,"text":"One way to convince yourself is just to, you know, plot <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93479,"label":"command","start_offset":51,"end_offset":55}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233832,"text":"You know that there's two roots.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233833,"text":"So, it might look like this, or might look like that depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233834,"text":"But, in either case, it will take values of both signs.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233836,"text":"The value takes both positive and negative values.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233837,"text":"And, so that means we have a saddle point, while the other situation, when <EXPRESSION> is negative -- -- means that this equation is quadratic never takes the value, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233838,"text":"So, it's always positive or it's always negative, depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233839,"text":"So, the other case is if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then the quadratic doesn't have a solution.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233840,"text":"And it could look like this or like that depending on whether <EXPRESSION> is positive or <EXPRESSION> is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233841,"text":"So, in particular, that means that <EXPRESSION> is always positive or always negative depending on the sign of <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233842,"text":"And then, that tells us that our function, , will be always positive or always negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233843,"text":"And then we'll get a minimum or maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233844,"text":"OK, we'll have a min or a max depending on which situation we are in.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233845,"text":"OK, so that's another way to derive the same answer.","entities":[{"id":93484,"label":"command","start_offset":29,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233846,"text":"And now, you see here why the discriminate plays a role.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233847,"text":"That's because it exactly tells you whether this quadratic quantity has always the same sign, or whether it can actually cross the value, <EXPRESSION>, when you have the root of a quadratic.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233848,"text":"OK, so hopefully at this stage you are happy with one of the two explanations, at least.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233849,"text":"And now, you are willing to believe, I hope, that we have basically a way of deciding what type of critical point we have in the special case of a quadratic function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233850,"text":"OK, so, now what do we do with the general function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233851,"text":"Well, so in general, we want to look at second derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233852,"text":"OK, so now we are getting to the real stuff.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233853,"text":"So, how many second derivatives do we have?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233854,"text":"That's maybe the first thing we should figure out.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233855,"text":"Well, we can take the derivative first with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then again with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93485,"label":"command","start_offset":13,"end_offset":17},{"id":93486,"label":"method","start_offset":22,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233856,"text":"OK, that gives us something we denote by <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233857,"text":"Then, there's another one which is ,<EXPRESSION> which means you take the derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93487,"label":"command","start_offset":65,"end_offset":69},{"id":93488,"label":"method","start_offset":74,"end_offset":84}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233858,"text":"Another thing you can do, is do first derivative respect to <EXPRESSION>, and then with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93489,"label":"method","start_offset":38,"end_offset":48}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233861,"text":"These are actually always = to each other.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233862,"text":"OK, so it's the fact that we will admit, it's actually not very hard to check.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233863,"text":"So these are always the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233864,"text":"We don't need to worry about which one we do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233865,"text":"That's one computation that we won't need to do.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233866,"text":"We can save a bit of effort.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233867,"text":"And then, we have the last one, namely, the second partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233868,"text":"OK, so we have three of them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233869,"text":"So, what does the second derivative test say?","entities":[{"id":93490,"label":"method","start_offset":25,"end_offset":35}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233871,"text":"So, let's call capital A the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93493,"label":"method","start_offset":36,"end_offset":46}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233873,"text":"And <EQUATION> at this point, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233874,"text":"So, these are just numbers because we first compute the second derivative, and then we plug in the values of <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.","entities":[{"id":93495,"label":"method","start_offset":63,"end_offset":73}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233875,"text":"So, these will just be numbers.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233876,"text":"And now, what we do is we look at the quantity <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233877,"text":"I am not forgetting the four.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233878,"text":"You will see why there isn't one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233879,"text":"So, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, then there's two sub-cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233880,"text":"If A is positive, then it's local minimum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233881,"text":"The second case, so, still, if <EXPRESSION> is positive, but <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's going to be a local maximum.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233882,"text":"And, if <EXPRESSION> is negative, then it's a saddle point, and finally, if <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, then we actually cannot compute.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233884,"text":"We know it's degenerate in some way, but we don't know what type of point it is.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233885,"text":"OK, so that's actually what you need to remember.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233886,"text":"If you are formula oriented, that's all you need to remember about today.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233887,"text":"But, let's try to understand why, how this comes out of what we had there.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233888,"text":"OK, so, I think maybe I actually want to keep, so maybe I want to keep this middle board because it actually has, you know, the recipe that we found before the quadratic function.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233889,"text":"So, let me move directly over there and try to relate our old recipe with the new.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233890,"text":"OK, you are easily amused.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233891,"text":"OK, so first, let's check that these two things say the same thing in the special case that we are looking at.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233892,"text":"OK, so let's verify in the special case where the function was <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233893,"text":"So -- Well, what is the second derivative with respect to <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>?","entities":[{"id":93497,"label":"method","start_offset":31,"end_offset":41}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233896,"text":"That will be <EXPRESSION> by, right?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233897,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> will be, well, let's take a partial with respect to <EXPRESSION> again.","entities":[{"id":93503,"label":"command","start_offset":38,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233898,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":233900,"text":"OK, now we need, also, the partial with respect to <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233901,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233902,"text":"In case you don't believe what I told you about the mixed partials, <EXPRESSION>, well, you can check.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233903,"text":"And it's, again, <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233904,"text":"So, they are, indeed, the same thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233905,"text":"And, <EXPRESSION> will be <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233906,"text":"So, if we now look at these quantities, that tells us, well, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>, <EXPRESSION> is <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233907,"text":"So, <EXPRESSION> is what we used to call <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233908,"text":"OK, ooh.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233909,"text":"So, now you can compare the cases.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233910,"text":"They are not listed in the same order just to make it harder.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233911,"text":"So, we said first, so the saddle case is when <EXPRESSION> in big letters is negative, that's the same as <EXPRESSION> in lower case is negative.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233912,"text":"The case where capital <EXPRESSION> is positive, local min and local max corresponds to this one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233913,"text":"And, the case where we can't conclude was what used to be the degenerate one.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233914,"text":"OK, so at least we don't seem to have messed up when copying the formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233915,"text":"Now, why does that work more generally than that?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233916,"text":"Well, the answer that is, again, Taylor approximation.OK, so let me just do here quadratic approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233917,"text":"So, quadratic approximation tells me the following thing.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233918,"text":"It tells me, if I have a function, <EXPRESSION>, and I want to understand the change in <EXPRESSION> when I change <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> a little bit.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233919,"text":"Well, there's the first-order terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233920,"text":"There is the linear terms that by now you should know and be comfortable with.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233921,"text":"That's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93506,"label":"command","start_offset":20,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233922,"text":"And then, there's <EXPRESSION> times the change in <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93507,"label":"command","start_offset":31,"end_offset":36}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233923,"text":"OK, that's the starting point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233924,"text":"But now, of course, if <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>, sorry, if we are at the critical point, then that's going to be <EXPRESSION> at the critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233925,"text":"So, that term actually goes away, and that's also zero at the critical point.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233926,"text":"So, that term also goes away.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233927,"text":"OK, so linear approximation is really no good.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233928,"text":"We need more terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233929,"text":"So, what are the next terms?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233930,"text":"Well, the next terms are quadratic terms, and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor formula for a function of a single variable, there was the derivative times <EXPRESSION> of a second derivative times <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93508,"label":"method","start_offset":143,"end_offset":153},{"id":93509,"label":"command","start_offset":154,"end_offset":159},{"id":93510,"label":"method","start_offset":185,"end_offset":195},{"id":93511,"label":"command","start_offset":196,"end_offset":201}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233931,"text":"And see, this side here is really Taylor approximation in one variable looking only at <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233932,"text":"But of course, we also have terms involving <EXPRESSION>, and terms involving simultaneously <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233933,"text":"And, these terms are <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> times change in <EXPRESSION> plus <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93512,"label":"command","start_offset":34,"end_offset":39},{"id":93513,"label":"command","start_offset":63,"end_offset":68},{"id":93514,"label":"command","start_offset":92,"end_offset":96}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233934,"text":"There's no one half in the middle because, in fact, you would have two terms, one for <EXPRESSION>, one for <EXPRESSION>, but they are the same.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233935,"text":"And then, if you want to continue, there is actually cubic terms involving the third derivatives, and so on, but we are not actually looking at them.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233936,"text":"And so, now, when we do this approximation, well, the type of critical point remains the same when we replace the function by this approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233938,"text":"In fact, it still works in the general case using this approximation formula.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233939,"text":"So -- The general case reduces to the quadratic case.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233940,"text":"And now, you see actually why, well, here you see, again, how this coefficient which we used to call little a is also <EXPRESSION> of capital A.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233941,"text":"And same here: this coefficient is what we call capital B or little b, and this coefficient here is what we called little c or <EXPRESSION> of capital C.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233942,"text":"And then, when you replace these into the various cases that we had here, you end up with the second derivative test.","entities":[{"id":93516,"label":"method","start_offset":101,"end_offset":111}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233943,"text":"So, what about the degenerate case?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233944,"text":"Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a degenerate critical point?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233945,"text":"So, the reason is that this approximation formula is reasonable only if the higher order terms are negligible.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233946,"text":"OK, so in fact, secretly, there's more terms.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233947,"text":"This is only an approximation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233948,"text":"There would be terms involving third derivatives, and maybe even beyond that.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233950,"text":"But, in the degenerate case, see, if I start with this and I add something even very, very small along the y axis, then that can be enough to bend this very slightly up or slightly down, and turn my degenerate point in to either a minimum or a saddle point.","entities":[{"id":93519,"label":"command","start_offset":61,"end_offset":64}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233951,"text":"And, I won't be able to tell until I go further in the list of derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233952,"text":"So, in the degenerate case, what actually happens depends on the higher order derivatives.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233953,"text":"So, we will need to analyze things more carefully.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233954,"text":"Well, we're not going to bother with that in this class.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233955,"text":"So, we'll just say, well, we cannot compute, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233956,"text":"I mean, you have to realize that in real life, you have to be extremely unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233957,"text":"Well, if that happens, then what you should do is maybe try by inspection.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233958,"text":"See if there's a good reason why the function should always be positive or always be negative, or something.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233959,"text":"Or, you know, plot it on a computer and see what happens.","entities":[{"id":93521,"label":"command","start_offset":14,"end_offset":18}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233960,"text":"But, otherwise we can't compute.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233961,"text":"OK, so let's do an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233962,"text":"So, probably I should leave this on so that we still have the test with us.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233963,"text":"And, instead, OK, so I'll do my example here.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233964,"text":"OK, so just an example.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233965,"text":"Let's look at <EQUATION>, where <EXPRESSION> and <EXPRESSION> are positive.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233966,"text":"So, I'm looking only at the first quadrant.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233967,"text":"OK, I mean, I'm doing this because I don't want the denominator to become <EXPRESSION>.","entities":[{"id":93522,"label":"command_attribute","start_offset":52,"end_offset":63}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233968,"text":"So, I'm just looking at the situation.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233969,"text":"So, let's look first for, so, the question will be, what are the minimum and maximum of this function?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":233970,"text":"So, the first thing we should do to answer this question is look for critical points, OK?","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
